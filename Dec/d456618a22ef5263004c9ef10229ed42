Latest report reaching National Daily reveals that the English Premier League (EPL) are reportedly set to introduce concussion substitutes from the start of next season as concerns over players’ safety heightens.

It would mark another radical change to the way football is officiated just 12 months on from the introduction of VAR to England’s top flight.
The International Football Association Board (IFAB) will discuss changing the laws to facilitate concussion substitutes at a meeting in February, National Daily gathered from the report the Daily Mail.
And the Premier League apparently want to run a trial of whichever system is chosen next term.
The IFAB convened last week to appoint a selection of medical experts to consider how the use of concussion substitutes would work.
The other system – similar to that used in rugby union – would see the affected player taken to the dressing room for a 10-15 minute ‘head test’.
They would be replaced for the duration of the assessment but be allowed to return to the action if they are deemed medically fit to do so.
The Premier League are reportedly open-minded about which system would work better and will wait for the IFAB to make a decision before discussing the matter with member clubs.
Football has come under fire for how the sport has dealt with concussion in recent years.
The decision to allow Jan Vertonghen to return to the pitch during the first leg of Tottenham’s Champions League semi-final against Ajax last season was questioned.
