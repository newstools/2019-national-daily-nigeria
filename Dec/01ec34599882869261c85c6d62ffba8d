President Muhammadu Buhari has further limited globe-trotting by his ministers whoÂ can only travel out of the country eight times in a year.
Minister of Information, Culture & Tourism Minister Lai Mohammed disclosed this in a statement on Monday.
According to him, Buhari has directed that no Minister should go on foreign trips more than twice in a quarter.
Also, according to Mohammed, no minister on a trip outside the shores of the land should go with more than four aides.
Government officials below the rank of ministers are henceforth entitled to fewer aides.
Estacode would no longer be calculated on hourly basis, either.
Buhari earlier made some restrictions on foreign trips by the ministers, in an effort to reduce cost of running the administration.
