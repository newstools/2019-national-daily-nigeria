Tax payers have 30 days to obtain their 20202 clearance certificates or else the Federal Inland Revenue Service will impose lien on their bank accounts in order to recover outstanding debt they owe the service.
The Executive Chairman, Muhammad Nami, said this in a notice to taxpayers released on Sunday.
According to him, the service has received numerous complaints from taxpayers on difficulties encountered in obtaining the TCC.
He also said considering the fact that the TCC would be used by contractors and service providers to seek contracts, obtain loans, renew permits, registration, franchises, and sign agreements, there is a need to make it easier for taxpayers to obtain the TCC.
Nami noted that the offer to ease the issuance of the TCC was in line with the provisions of Section 101 (1) of Companies Income Tax Act 2004 and in conformity with Self-Assessment Regulation, 2011.
“Taxpayers are therefore encouraged to take advantage of this initiative and apply for their 2020 TCC as soon as possible.”
