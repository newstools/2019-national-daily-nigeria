Sen. Orji Kalu, convicted of N7.1bn fraud and sentenced to 12 yearsâ€™ imprisonment Dec 5, has urged the court to grant him a post-conviction bail.
The former governor in an application on Tuesday said that he is battling serious health challenges, and the medical facilities in the prison cannot handle.
He said since the offences he was convicted of were bailable offences, the court should free him while he challenges his conviction at the Court of Appeal.
He also said that as the Chief Whip of the Senate and the senator representing Abia North Senatorial District, he needs to secure the interest of his constituents.
But the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission opposed the post-conviction bail application
