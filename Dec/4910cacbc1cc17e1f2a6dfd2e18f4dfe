Reports reaching National Daily reveal that Arsenal have been dealt a potential transfer boost in their pursuit of RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano.
Upamecano has previously been linked with a move to the Emirates
The 21-year-old has been linked with a move to the Emirates for some time, and could now be free to move in January National Daily learnt.
Reports in France suggest Leipzig are happy to let Upamecano leave the club, providing they can tie up Tanguy Kouassi’s contract.
Kouassi, 17, is set to snub current club PSG to sign professional terms with Leipzig.
The youngster is seen as the long-term successor to Upamecano, but Leipzig are prepared to start the process early, according to Le Parisien.
That will alert the attentions of Arsenal, who are keen on signing at least one central defender in next month’s window.
The Gunners were interested in Upamecano in the summer, but opted for David Luiz after baulking at Leipzig’s asking price.
Dayot Upamecano could help strengthen Arsenal weak defence
Arsenal refused to pay more than £55million for the French international.
But with Upamecano’s contract expiring at the end of next season, Arsenal feel they could now land him for a fee closer to the £40m mark.
Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is also hopeful of strengthening in defensive midfield, with Granit Xhaka expected to leave the club.
Arteta told Xhaka he was free to move elsewhere, with the player’s agent since revealing Herta Berlin have made a bid.
Xhaka is expected to finally leave Arsenal in January
He is more desperate to get out of Arsenal after reportedly growing angry with Arteta for contradicting their chat by praising the Swiss star publicly.
Xhaka’s agent Jose Noguera said: “We are in agreement with Hertha Berlin and [Xhaka] would like to go. So we told [Arsenal’s Head of Football] Raul Sanllehi and sports director Edu – as well as the new coach Mikel Arteta.”
