Iraq’s caretaker premier Adel Abdel Mahdi on Tuesday ordered the crowd that invaded the US embassy in anger at deadly US air strikes to vacate the premises “immediately.”
It was gathered that protesters had breached the embassy walls in agitation of the Sunday strikes that killed at least 25 fighters from a hardline pro-Iran faction known as Kataeb Hezbollah.
“We recall that any aggression or harassment of foreign embassies will be firmly prohibited by the security forces,” Abdel Mahdi’s office said several hours after the attack began.
