Manchester United fans have got a great reason to celebrate as their star player Paul Pogba could make his first start for nearly three months against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday National Daily have learnt.
Paul Pogba could return to starting line-up after three months
The French international has returned to the fold as a substitute in the last two matches shaving recovered from an ankle injury National Daily further gathered.
United boss Ole Gunnar Solksjaer believes he will be welcoming a world class talent back into the fold when the 26-year-old does return to the XI but said he will need to be ‘drip fed’ back into the starting XI.
Solkjaer would be delighted to have Pogba fully integrated back into United’s squad
“He’s worked really hard but then it’s been a long lay-off,” said Solksjaer. “So we’ll have to drip-feed him in and play gradually more and more.”
And Sean Dyche knows that Pogba, plus the rest of his United colleagues, pose a threat to the Clarets who will be looking to bounce back from the disappointing 1-0 reverse to Everton on Boxing Day.
“We haven’t seen him much this season so Ole might look at it slightly differently. He is a top player obviously but they have a lot of top players,” said Dyche of United.
