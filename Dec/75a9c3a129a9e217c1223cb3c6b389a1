A sports journalist, Temison Okomi, who works with Classic FM recently took to Twitter to narrate a story that happened some 10 years ago. Temison Okomi

According to his tweets (thread), some 10 years back, he stumbled on a young waiter where he was drinking and felt at 17, the girl was too young to work in such a place.

He said, “A few years ago, I was drinking at this joint I normally drink at in G.R.A when this young waitress served. Looked all of 17 & it was quite late. I was a bit bothered. She looked way too young. So I asked her. She was 17. Pretty young girl”.

He went further on the thread, “I could see her immediate future at that joint, with pervy old men like me drinking there, so I asked her why she wasn’t in school. Familiar tale of no money so she was waiting tables until she could save up to buy forms for SSCE & JAMB. I don’t remember how much it was”.

See the rest of the thread:

but I asked her: “If you get money for these forms, you will stop doing this job?” She said; “Yes.” So I dipped me hands & pulled out my lean stash. Gave her the loot & told her she could quit. I don’t do appreciation. I don’t know how to handle it.

She calls me up the next day & her mom gets on the phone & starts praying for me. Truly embarrassing stuff. That was the last time I spoke with her or her mom. Fast forward to 10 minutes ago. She just called me. She said she lost my card but her mom just found it. She is doing her convocation on Friday. Ladies & gents; I’m flummoxed.

Her name is Feyi & I had forgotten about her. Truthfully, I don’t even recall her face again.

She is a graduate.

I win 2019, you heifers!

He is currently trending on Twitter and has since become a hero of some sort.
