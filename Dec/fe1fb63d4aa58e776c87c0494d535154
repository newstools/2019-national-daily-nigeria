The Nigerian Senate on Thursday commenced the investigation of the executive lawlessness demonstrated by the operatives of the State Security Service (SSS) in the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, for the arrest of Omoyele Sowore, who is standing trial for alleged treason and money laundry being brought against him by the Nigerian government.
Th SSS operatives had arrived the court in at least three pickup vehicles, storming the courtroom d the court on Friday last week to re-arrest Omoyele Sowore who was released on Thursday by the SSS on the order of the court.
The invasion of the courtroom generated momentary disorder in the courtroom, forcing the presiding judge to flee for her safety.
Counsel to Sowore, Femi Falana, Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN, had protested that it was wrong for the SSS to make an arrest in the courtroom.
Falana had later driven Sowore in his vehicle to the SSS office where he was re-arrested and detained.
The House of Representatives had earlier investigated the matter and came up with a resolution.
However, the SSS was said to have apologized to the judge, Justice Ojukwu over the invasion of the courtroom.
