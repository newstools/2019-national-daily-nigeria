President Muhammadu Buhari may have embarked on self-image laundry after the controversial 2019 general elections, promising not to succumb to partisan pressures to influence the 2023 general elections.
President Buhari on his 77th birthday on Tuesday, assured that he will not favour any politician to compromise the electoral process in 2023, promising to give Nigerians a free, fair and credible election.
The president made the promise Tuesday morning when Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, and some of his aides and assistants were at the State House, Abuja, to present a birthday card in commemoration of mark his 77th birthday anniversary.
Buhari counseled political actors intending to contest in the 2023 general elections to start working hard to merit the trust of the people, warning that he would not allow the manipulation of the electoral process or altering the rules for anyone contrary to the will of Nigerians.
President Buhari challenged All Progressives Congress (APC) members, acquainting them that whoever wants to contest must work hard as he will not condone anyone using the name of his office to canvass for support.
