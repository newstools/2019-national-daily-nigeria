The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole coordinated by the Nigerian Airforce at the weekend located, bombarded and killed members of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) at a meeting venue in Borno State.
The Nigerian Air Force Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, in a statement, narrated that the insurgents convened to meet at their hideout in Kollaram on the fringes of Lake Chad in the Northern part of Borno State.
“In continuation of Operation Rattle Snake, the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has neutralized some Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters as they assembled for a meeting at their hideout in Kollaram on the fringes of Lake Chad in the Northern part of Borno State.
“The operation was executed on 14 December 2019 following credible intelligence reports indicating that some of the ISWAP leaders had assembled for a meeting in one of 2 buildings at the centre of the settlement.”
He highlighted: “The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) jets dispatched by the ATF to attack the location scored accurate hits on the target building completely obliterating it and killing its terrorists’ occupants.
