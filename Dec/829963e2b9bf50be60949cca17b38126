A coalition of civil society organizations in Nigeria at a meeting in Abuja on Monday issued President Muhammadu Buhari 14 days ultimatum to order the release of Omoyele Sowore, Convener of the #RevolutionNow Movement from the detention cell of the Department of Security Service (DSS).
The CSOs condemned  the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, by DSS operatives who rearrested Sowore in the courtroom, causing pandemonium.
The CSOs also demanded President Buhari to ensure the Federal Government prosecute the DSS officials who invaded the courtroom, threatening that there would be a nationwide protest at every National Human Rights Commission Office across the country.
The group further demanded that all illegally detained persons by the DSS, police or other security agents be released without further delay.
The civil society organization in attendance at the meeting include the Centre for Democracy and Development; Occupy Nigeria; Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), among others.
