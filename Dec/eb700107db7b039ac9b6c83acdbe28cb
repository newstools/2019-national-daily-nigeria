The Independent Corrupt Practices and other Offences Commission (ICPC) has alleged, that a senator from Imo State diverted projects for his constituency to his personal hotel.
The anti-graft agency also alleged that another federal lawmaker procured tricycles and buses for constituency projects, but instead of giving them out to the people of the constituency, confiscated and packed them in his own residence.
The ICPC commissioner in the state, Udonsi Arua, who made the allegation during the celebration of the 2019 United Nations International Anti-Corruption Day in Owerri, the state capital, however, refused to name the Federal lawmakers who committed the alleged acts.
Arua, who represented and spoke on behalf of the ICPC chairman, Professor Bolaji Owasanoye, called on Nigerians to collaborate and cooperate with anti-graft agencies in the fight against corruption.
He said, “When a country’s institutions are weakened by corruption, for instance, its security forces would not be trusted, its borders would become porous, criminality will fester and insecurity maybe internationalized.”
