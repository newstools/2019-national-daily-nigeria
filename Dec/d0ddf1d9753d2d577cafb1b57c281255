Popular singer, Davido trended heavily on social media for not going bumper to bumper with curvy American rapper, Megan thee Stallion while she was twerking for him at a concert in Lagos.

But the DMW CEO reacted to several tweets and mentions with a simple caption that reads, “Ex Hotboy”.

As monitored by the spotte.ng Megan Thee Stallion brought Davido up on stage to perform his hit track, ‘Risky’ and Meghan tried to rock Davido by twerking vigorously during the performance.

But what shocked fans were the fact that the Nigerian singer did not touch or respond, rather he moved backward.

The father of three took to Instagram to respond, giving reasons for his action. With a video post of the stage incident he wrote, “Ex Hotboy”.

So what does it mean? Ex Hotboy means he is now a married man. No longer a boy and so he would jump at all the curvy backs that come calling.

Davido dropped one of the biggest news of 2019 when he announced he would be marrying Chioma. Davido is set to tie the knot with bae, Chioma Avril Rowland. And that will be a big wedding for 2020. The music star had shared a photo of his introduction ceremony via his Instagram page and hinted about the wedding planning. We think two of the biggest weddings that would be taking place 2020 would be that of Adewale Adeleke, elder brother to Davido who just proposed to his girlfriend. And that of Davido and Chioma. We can’t wait to see how the Adelekes would turn up for one of their own as this dynasty is yet to witness a society wedding in recent times.

Should we be proud of Davido?
