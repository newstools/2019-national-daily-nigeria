Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State  has cautioned Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to desist from depending on thugs and violence to win elections.
The Edo Governor exposed Oshiomhole that he never won elections on performance but through violence and thuggery.
Report indicated that Obaseki in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, chided Oshiomhole over his boasting that he didn’t teach Governor Obaseki and Deputy Governor Phillip Shuabi how to lose elections.
The governor was of the view that Oshiomhole was struggling to cover up his inordinate ambition to be the ultimate godfather in Edo State and usurp the will of the majority of ordinary Edo people.
“Even his allegory of politics being like a forest with dangerous animals is a poor excuse to continue to perpetuate thuggery and the keep the collective patrimony under the control of a few greedy and violent people in the name of winning units and ward elections.
“Good governance remains the surest path towards winning elections especially when you are committed to free and fair and credible elections devoid of the kind of violence witnessed in recent elections in the country.
“So, instead of trying to pacify the violent and the lawless just because you want to win elections, Oshiomhole should support the stellar performance being displayed by Governor Godwin Obaseki in Edo State, that way, he will not need the services of his thugs to win the next election,” the statement read in part.
