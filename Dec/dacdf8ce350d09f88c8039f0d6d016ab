Omoyele Sowore, leader of the Revolution Now Movement, has continued to cause discomfort for President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over his continued detention in defiance of the court orders for his release.  Apparently, a Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday summoned the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, Director General of the DSS, Yusuf Bichi, to appear before the court to explain the defiance of the order of the court on Sowore’s release and the continuous detention.
Counsel to Sowore made a fresh application for an order of the court to release the defendant who was re-arrested on the 6th of December, within 24 hours of his release on Thursday as ordered by the court.
Justice Ekwo noted that he has seen all processes filed and adjourned the case to 23rd of December for hearing while mandating the Deputy Chief of the Court to notify the AGF and DG DSS of the proceedings and the order
