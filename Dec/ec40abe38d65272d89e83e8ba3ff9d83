Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has insisted he will not set any goal targets for his forwards.
Solskjaer, a supreme finisher for the Reds during his playing days, explained that it added pressure to the players.

However, he told reporters ahead of Sunday’s home fixture against Aston Villa: “I won’t be setting goal targets for Marcus, Anthony or any of my players because it’s counter-productive.
“The only thing I demand from my forwards is that they do all the things we work on in training to give themselves the best chance of scoring. That means getting into good positions, keeping yourself moving and concentrating on finding the best shot or header possible.
“That philosophy stood me in good stead when I was a player. Some of the other lads I played with set themselves targets at the start of each season — and it worked for them.
“But I always wondered why strikers would give themselves one thing extra to worry about.
“I never set myself targets in terms of goals because, no matter how many times I hit the back of the net, I always wondered where my next goal was going to come from.
“I always felt that setting players certain targets put them under a level of extra pressure they don’t need.
“If you score a goal, that’s great. Then you focus on scoring the next one.”
