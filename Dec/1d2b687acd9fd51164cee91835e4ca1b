Nigerians have taken to twitter to react to Aisha Buhari’s recent attack on Garba Shehu, her husband’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity and Mamman Daura, her hubby’s closest ally.
In a statement released today December 11th, Aisha Buhari alleged that Garba Shehu has shifted his loyalty from the President to others who have no stake in the compact that the President signed with Nigerians on May 29, 2015, and 2019.
Some Nigerians on Twitter are not taking sides with Aisha Buhari on this matter, mostly because she is in support of the Social Media Regulation bill.
According a twitter, @edwardessien, whenever Aisha Buhari has issues with the cabal, she runs to the Social Media & Press to cry wolf. This same woman advocated for a ban on social media, remember?
“Madam, please stew in your vomit and leave us out. The damage your husband & his cabal has created for us is still here,” he twitted.
@isidags tweets: If you observe this woman closely you’ll realize she’s as selfish as selfish can be. Don’t be deceived into thinking she has the country’s best interest at hearth
