Prophet Samuel Abiara has expressed his support for  the controversial social media bill.
The founder of Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Agbala Itura Lagos  said the bill was meant only to fight sensationalism in the media space that could destroy Nigeria.
Addressing journalists in Ibadan, Oyo State on Saturday, Abiara said some unscrupulous elements have used the social media to spread fake news about Nigerian leaders and clergymen.
“It is good that social media has expanded the information space globally. People connect and communicate better than before,” he said.
“But that privilege has been abused many times by unscrupulous elements who have been spreading fake news and labelling government officials and church leaders.
“People should be free to talk but once they report false or fake news, there should be consequences. They should not be allowed to get away with abusing the platform.”
