Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State may be consolidating his political forte to lock up the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, in the state party. Obaseki who has been having protracted battle with his predecessor and self-imposed godfather, Oshiomhole, has been insisting on his leadership of APC in Edo State to give the national chairman a good fight.
Obaseki at a caucus meeting of APC leaders in Edo North Senatorial District on Friday maintained that Oshiomhole’s suspension from the state APC is still in force, adding that the suspension is in the best interest of the party.
The incumbent governor was of the view that Oshiomhole has been making negative influence in Edo State and the party. He affirmed that he is the APC leader in Edo State and therefore, oversees the running of the party in the state, warning Oshiomhole to desist from causing disaffection in the state party.
“I am the APC leader in Edo State, and it is the person that is causing anti-party who has created his own faction of APC that will leave.
“If you can’t be a disciplined member of our party, then, you leave, whether you claim to be a national chairman or not.
“My position is clear; Comrade Oshiomhole stands suspended from APC in Edo,” Obaseki had declared.
