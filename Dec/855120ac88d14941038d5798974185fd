The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has seized the international passport and restricted the movement of the founder of Air Peace, Allen Onyema.
According to a source within the EFCC, Onyema had maintained his status of innocence, but investigations are still ongoing and as such it was imperative to restrict his movement.
“Following his interaction with our detectives, it became imperative to restrict his movement to the country because we will need him from time to time. We have seized his passports for unfettered comprehensive investigation. And so far, he has cooperated with our team,” the source said.
The Commission added that the possibility of extraditing Onyema to the US would depend on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) between Nigeria and the United States of America. The EFCC also stated that it has to investigate and arraign suspects in court before any extradition application can be initiated.
Recall that the U.S. Attorney, Byung J. “BJay” Pak of the Justice Department had accused Onyema of moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through US bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.
The US court had since then issued a warrant to arrest Onyema and authorised US marshals service to bring him into custody.
Meanwhile, Northern youths in Nigeria under the aegis of Arewa Youth Patriotic Front have released a statement signalling a planned rally in the works over Onyema’s indictment.
The youths are reportedly mobilising their members across the Northern States of the country to raise their concerns and suspicion over the timing of the alleged indictment of the Air Peace founder.
According to the statement, the youths believe that Onyema was allegedly framed in collaboration with some Nigerians to undermine his business interest across Africa.
