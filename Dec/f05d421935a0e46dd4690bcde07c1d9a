President Muhammadu Buhari is not taking it lightly with those trying to dust his name to curry sympathies ahead f the 2023 general election.
He said anyone aspiring to occupy a political office has to work hard to achieve his goal, instead of dropping his name.
This might escalate the fear many have about the longevity of the party.
Many are of the believe the ruling party will disintegrate as soon as Buhari leaves office.
Buhari spoke at the State House, Abuja when some of his aides presented him a birthday card on his 77th birthday.
Those close to the president, politically, especially the hopeful from the north, like to piggyback on the street-cred of Buhari to bolster their campaign and chances at both the primary and general elections.
Aspirants, including Kaduna Gov Nasir El Rufai, APC leader Bola Tinubu, and others, hve been rumoured to be interested in the residency come 2023.
However, none of these party members have voiced out their interest as many speculate.
