The fight between two PDP governors from the south-south is getting messier as the party scramble to bring the two governors to order..
Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike just alleged that his Bayelsa counterpart Seriake Dickson colluded with President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC to destroy the PDP chances in the last guber election in the state.
According to him, Seriake did that so that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, will not arrest him when he leaves office.
Wike said that the Bayelsa governor was never committed to the PDP all through the elections.
Governor Wike claimed in the statement that Dickson has realised that the APC and Buhari played him and all the promises they made to him were not kept.
“We are the only State in the South-South that President Muhammadu Buhari never got 25percent. Buhari got 45 percent in Bayelsa State. So who colluded with who?” Wike said this in a statement signed by Simeon Nwakaudu, his Special Assistant on Electronic Media.
 
“It is now that Dickson has realised that they played him? All those nocturnal promises were not kept.
“You cannot accord Former President Goodluck Jonathan respect. Simply because Rivers State honoured Jonathan, Dickson became angry.”
The PDP has warned the two governors to sheathe their sword so that a reconciliation committee being put together will help them resolve the crisis.
The two governors are battling each other because of oil wells on the border between the two states which the court ordered Bayelsa to release to Rivers.
