Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, says the controversial hate speech bill will not be endorsed by the 9th assembly following the public outcry against the proposed bill in the country.
Lawan made the disclosure in response to a detailed written protest letter against the hate speech bill and anti-social media bill by the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA.
He said legislators will listen to the pulse of the Nigerians who have rejected the bills and will do exactly as they demanded.
HURIWA had on November 13th, 2019 written to the senate through the offices of the Senate President titled: “WHY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY’S BILLS AGAINST FREE SPEECH ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
HURIWA in the petition argued that freedom of expression is one of the fundamental rights provided in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).
“By virtue of the same and other international instruments, it is the freedom to hold opinions, receive ideas and information and impart ideas and information without interference. Social media is used in reference to the means of expression other than the mainstream media.”
The group urged the National Assembly to stop forthwith any attempt to legislate laws that offend the Rights to Freedom of Speech, reminding the lawmakers that Freedom of Expression in Nigeria is grounded constitutionally in Section 39 of the CFRN entrenches the right to freedom of expression.
The Rights group said similar provisions are found in Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Lawan in his reply through his Chief of Staff; Alhaji Babagana M. Aji stated that the Senate will not pass any anti-people laws, assuring HURIWA that the senate is also concerned and will do everything to protect the rights of the people.
