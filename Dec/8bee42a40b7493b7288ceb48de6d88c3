The singer who is currently receiving applause for his A Good Time album, took to his Instagram page to share a cute photo with his adorable baby girl.

In the photo, the singer is seen holding Imade in his arms on what appears to be a private jet. Sharing the photo, he captioned:

 “Taking my baby in lil Vacay “It turns out that the singer didn’t just take his daughter along, but his baby mama, Sophia Momodu as well.

She also took to her Instagram page to share a photo of herself also in a private jet headed to Ghana.
Sharing the photo, she wrote:

“Dear Ghana, be good to me #TouchDown”

Recall the two had quite a rocky relationship in the earliest months of Imade’s life and custody drama between them was often the topic of discussion on social media.

Well, over the year, it appears that the two have developed a civil relationship for the sake of their beautiful daughter.

Still on Davido, the singer was the talk of all on social media and his recently held music concert at Eko Energy City has a lot to do with it. The show which was sold out, had Davido giving out his all in the performance.

The singer who left fans enthralled, not only made his fans proud but his father as well. The singer recently took to his Instastory to share a screenshot of the loving message his billionaire dad sent to him.
