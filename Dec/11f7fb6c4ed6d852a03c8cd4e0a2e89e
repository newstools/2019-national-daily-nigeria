There was hot debate over Governor Ganduje reassigned Emirates Bill at the Kano State House of Assembly as Members disagreed over the Bill.
The Assembly failed to agree on the passage of the new Emirate Council Bill 2019, which was sent by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to restore the four first-class emirates that were dissolved by a Kano high court.
The Assembly members were said to have spent almost three hours in a secret session debating the bill but failed to reach an agreement.
It could be recalled that Kano state government had approved a fresh bill to restore the four emirates in Bichi, Ran0, Karaye and Gaya, after they were nullified by a Kano high court.
The House has adjourned the meeting till tomorrow Thursday to continue debating on the issue.
