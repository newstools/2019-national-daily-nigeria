Femi Fani-Kayode has called Vice President Yemi Osinbajo  a “slave-man” for saying Buhari permits Christians at Aso Rock to hold service behind his kitchen.
Osinbajo made the statement  spoke at the opening of the General Assembly of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs in Abuja on Sunday.
According to Osinbajo the Chapel is located on the premises of the President and his family.
“Sometimes when I see the President on a Sunday morning, he asks me whether the service is over already or I am escaping from the service!
“That is the sort of tolerance that we need in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious society and it is the duty of leaders to show that sort of example.”
However,  Fani-Kayode in a tweet wrote: “@MBuhari is gracious enough to allow us to have Christian worship behind his kitchen – @ProfOsinbajo.
“Slave-man talking! The next thing he will say is that Buhari is gracious enough to allow Christians to sing hymns and pray in his toilet! And someone said this man is a Pastor?”
