The lead counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigeous People of Biafra (IPOB), Ifeanyi Ejiofor, has commenced legal action against the Nigeria Police at the Federal High Court over the invasion of his house and alleged killing of four occupants by operatives of the force.
In the suit filed on his behalf by his lawyer, Maxwell Okpara, Ejiofor is asking the court for an order to compel police to pay him the sum of N2 billion as compensation and damages for the burning of his house andÂ  alleged shooting of his aged mother by the police at his home to in Anambra State on December 2.
He is also seeking the court to restrain the police from further harassing, intimidating, threatening his life and destroying his properties.
He further applied for an order of the court stopping the respondents from threatening him with arrest and torture and to compel them to retract the public notice made on December 3, which declared him wanted and to also tender apology to him in five major newspapers and any other form of reparation.
Meanwhile, police authorities in Anambra State last week declared one Ejiofor, wanted following an incident in Oraifite town which led to the killing of two police officers by suspected members of the proscribed IPOB group.
The Commissioner of Police in Anambra State, John Abang while declaring Ejiofor wanted appeled to residents to promptly report any information on his whereabouts to the police or other security agencies.
