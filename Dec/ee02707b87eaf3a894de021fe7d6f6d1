Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has congratulated  Senator-elect, Smart Adeyemi on emerging winner of Kogi West Senatorial rerun election.
Olayinde Lawal, the returning officer of the election, declared Adeyemi winner at the end of the rerun on Saturday.
The APC candidate got 88,373 votes to defeat Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), his closest challenger, who polled 62,133 votes.
The APC chairman described Adeyemi’s victory as the end of the relics of 16 “rebellious” senators who went against APC.
Oshiomhole said this in a statement signed by him and issued Saturday night in Abuja.
“The victory has again affirmed the general acceptance of our great party, by the great people of Kogi State who just a few weeks ago voted massively for our governorship candidate, Governor Yahaya Bello, who was re-elected for a second term.,” the statement read in part.
“I have always believed in the ability of the people of Kogi West to elect leaders who will make them proud in the Senate and not the defeated Senator Melaye who is among the 16 Senators who rebelled against our party.
“As it stands today, the broom has swept away the entire 16 Senators, Dino being the last, who tried to destabilise our democracy for their personal interest, jettisoning the interest of the electorate.
