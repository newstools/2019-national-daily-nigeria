RevolutionNow protest convener Omoyele Sowore and his co-accused, Olawale Bakare, are finally released from the DSS detention in Abuja  around 7 pm Thursday .
They were released to their lead counsel and Senior Advocate of Nigeria Femi Falana who confirmed it to the National Daily.
Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of an Abuja Federal High Court earlier ordered the DSS to release the two within 24 hours.
She also ordered the DSS to pay the sum of N100,000 to Sowore, for refusing to release him on bail despite two court orders to that effect.
The judge then adjourned the trial of the case brought against to December 6 for continuation.
The two had been detained since August after they were arrested in Lagos in the lead up to the protest.
