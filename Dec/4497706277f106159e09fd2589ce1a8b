The Department of State Services (DSS) may have recanted from its earlier claim that the invasion and violent arrest of Omoyele Sowore was stage-managed. The Service was said to have sent a delegation to the Federal High Court, Abuja, to apologise for their invasion of the court to re-arrest Omoyele Sowore who was at the time being arraigned before the court presided by Justice Ojukwu.
It was gathered that the DSS delegation was led by  the Director of Operations and Director of Legal and have formally apologized to Justice Ojukwu in the office of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for the invasion of her court by the DSS.
There was insinuation that a lawyer allegedly struck Sowore with purported poisonous substance.
The lead counsel to Sowore, Femi Falana SAN, had challenged the DSS to prove that Sowore’s re-arrest was stage managed by his supporters.
