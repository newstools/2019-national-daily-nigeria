A Muslim Scholar in Australia, Imam Tawhidi, has chided the Nigeria government for using Boko Haram to achieve political goals and turning to fight the Boko Haram terrorists. He maintained that the Boko Haram terrorists were given wide space to operate at the early stage to the detriment of the country. This, however, was not unconnected with the intense power tussle between the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) where APC leaders were intimidating the then PDP government with blackmail of genocide against the north whenever the government takes harsh actions against the Boko Haram terrorists. Boko Haram then became political asset for the APC to blackmail the PDP government led by former President Goodluck Jonathan from the south.
The Australian Muslim Scholar, Imam Tawhidi, in his tweets, noted that they ignored Nigeria in discussions on terrorism, lamenting that Nigeria is the most corrupt country in Africa, and home to terrorist government and accommodates terrorists like the Pakistan government. He observed that the Boko Haram terrorists were the weapons of the government which now consider them enemies to be destroyed after using them.
Imam Tawhidi in his tweets stated: “We have ignored Nigeria in the discussion about terrorism. Nigeria is the most corrupt country in Africa. It is home to a terrorist government that harbours terrorists just like the government of Pakistan. Boko Haram were given the green light in their early stages. We Remember.
“Now all of a sudden Nigeria wants to lead the war against terror. Indeed, “my enemy is also my sword, I shall use him to kill with and then break the sword.”
