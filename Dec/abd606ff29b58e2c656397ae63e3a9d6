as Buhari endorses Interim Management

President Muhammadu Buhari has approved that the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) be recomposed and inaugurated after the forensic audit of the organization.
The President has also directed that the Interim Management Team of the NDDC shall be in place till the forensic audit is completed, and that the supervision of the Commission shall remain under the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs.
The presidential approvals and directives are coming amidst controversies over the interim management of the NDDC being put in place by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, after dismantling the interim management team appointed by President Buhari.  The presidential directives, therefore, indicates victory for Akpabio who Buhari maintained is responsible for the supervision of the NDDC.
President Buhari had ordered forensic audit of NDDC while hosting governors of Niger delta states on courtesy visit at the State House, Abuja. The governors had expressed dissatisfaction over the performance of the commission in juxtaposition with the funds being budgeted and spent by the management of NDDC over the years.
The president, however, made nominations of NDDC board members which he sent to the Senate for screening and confirmation. The senate has, accordingly, screened and confirmed the NDDC board nominees and returned the list to President Buhari for subsequent inauguration.
