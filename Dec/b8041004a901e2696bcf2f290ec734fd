The Chairman Emeritus of Daar Communications Plc, owners of AIT and Raypower Radio, High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, on Monday denied a report that he has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The report had alleged that Dokpesi is set to join APC, claiming that he has in fact, moved and that while official pronouncement would be made soon. Dokpesi said there is no modicum of truth in the report.
One Nimrod had in a tweet written: “Yet to be broken news. Chairman of AIT, High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, set to join APC.
“In fact, he has moved and an official launch will be done soonest.
Just in case you start seeing AIT airing pro-Buhari things, don’t fret, oga don port sharply.”
The tweet was sent to Dokpesi who debunked it. Dokpesi in response wrote: “There is no iota of truth in what I saw this morning as forwarded someone. I am at a PDP meeting as I type this message.”
Dokpesi had maintained that he has no reason to leave PDP for any other party, insisting that he would retire from politics in the PDP.
