Who are the players in United that would love to continue a working relationship with Jose Mourinho?A reunion seems inevitable for Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic.

 According to Matic, he can not rule anything out as anything is possible, including this opportunity to continue with Jose Mourinho at Tottenham in the January transfer window.

Matic, 31, has previously played under Mourinho at both Chelsea and United.

Ahead of the January window, Matic refused to rule out the fact he could link up with the Portuguese once again.

He told Omnisport: “As I know, you never know what’s going to happen in life. At the moment I’m a Manchester United player and very focused on my job and in the future we will see what’s going to happen.”

Another player that could be leaving Tottenham is Eriksen. We know he wants to go to Real Madrid. But he could end up in United. As Man United look to beef up their squad.

Manchester United already showed interest in James Maddison.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to build his team’s core around young, British players and Maddison fits the bill perfectly and also has quality in abundance.

However, according to ESPN, United have shot themselves in the foot over a potential deal because of Harry Maguire.

Last summer, United reluctantly met Leicester’s £80million asking price for the centre-back after a long summer of deliberation.

The deal made Maguire the most expensive defender in history and now Leicester have set a clear precedent, that they will not be pushed over during negations.
