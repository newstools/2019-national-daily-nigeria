A leading political actor in Nigeria, Femi Fani-Kayode, has declared that despite impeachment, the US lawmakers cannot remove President Donald Trump from office. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain maintained that Trump will win the 2020 presidential election in the United States of America. He recalled his previous predictions on Trump’s political voyage to the White which were all fulfilled.
Fani-Kayode in a tweet in his twitter handle wrote: “In 2016 I wrote an essay in which I predicted that Donald J. Trump would win the nomination as presidential candidate of the Republican party. He did.
“After he won I wrote another essay in which I predicted that he would defeat Hillary Clinton and win the presidential election. He did.
“In 2016 I wrote an essay in which I predicted that Donald Trump would win the nomination as presidential candidate of the Republican party. He did.
“After he won I wrote another essay in which I predicted that he would defeat Hillary Clinton and win the presidential election. He did.
“A few weeks ago I tweeted that no matter how hard the Democrats try and even if the House of Reps manage to impeach him, he would NOT be removed from office. I stand by that.
“Today, I go a step further and predict that he will win the 2020 Presidential election hands down and convincingly.
“He is, by far, the best thing that has happened to America and the world in years and God is with him. The forces of hell and the Anti-Christ CANNOT stop him. His rise is prophetic and his secret is Isaiah 45.
“He is the modern-day King Cyrus: he came to rebuild the walls of the Church, to save America, to fight evil, to set the captives free and to bring God’s light to the world.
“I pray for him every day and I urge every believer and God-fearing person to do the same. God defend, bless and be with President Donald Trump now and always!”
