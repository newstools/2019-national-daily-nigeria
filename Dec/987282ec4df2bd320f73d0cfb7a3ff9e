Nigeria’s Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami has dismissed speculations  that America, the media, any one or group forced President Muhammadu Buhari government to order the release of Omoyele Sowore and Sambo Dasuki.
“Even if we received any communication from them, that will never be the basis on the part of the Federal Government to obey or disobey court orders emanating from Nigeria,” he said in an interview with the VOA Hausa Service.
Four American federal lawmakers allegedly wrote a letter to Malami, requesting him to obey court orders and free the Sahara Reporters publishers arrested for organising a Revolution Now protest.
“The only reasons for the release of Omoyele Sowore and Sambo Dasuki revolved around our commitment to the rule of law, obedience to court orders and compassionate grounds.”
According to him, one has multiple options after a court has ruled on a matter, and he further has been harping on the possibilities of appealing the court ruling.
He also said it was blatant falsehood the claims that Dasuki was detained by Buhari to settle scores.
“The critical question that you may ask should be whether there is a strong suspicion of committing an offence or not.
“If there is a strong suspicion of committing an offence which deserved, as a matter of necessity, to be investigated through legal steps then there was no room for thinking of witch hunting an individual, scoring acrimony or personal vendetta against anyone.
“The time has now come for Sambo Dasuki and Omoyele Sowore to also enjoy bail based on the merit of their individual cases. They were charged based on their individual cases, taken to court, granted bail and now have been released.
“All the individuals involved were treated fairly and justly; they were taken to court, enjoyed the court’s favourable discretion and they were all released,” Malami said.
