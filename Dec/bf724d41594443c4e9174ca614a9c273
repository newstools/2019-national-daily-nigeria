The Senate, through its president Ahmad Lawan, has promised to commence work on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) the moment senators resume work in January 2020.
The proposed bill, which has encountered a lot of legislative setbacks over the years, will enable the Federal Government overhaul the petroleum industry, entrench efficiency and transparency in upstream and downstream operations and bring the processes up to date with international standards.
He equally affirmed that the Senate would start deliberation on the amendments proposed as bills by a number of senators.
Mr. Lawan stated this through Ola Awoniyi, his media aide on Sunday at the end-of-the-year get-together and award ceremony put together by the management of the Senate for its staff.
“By the time the lawmakers return from their break in January, the Petroleum Industry Bill which appeared to have defied passage and the constitutional amendment which is a continuous exercise will be addressed.
“The mode of operation of this current Senate is: we don’t give space; we don’t create any space in the middle. We just want it done and done away with it,” he said.
He further mentioned that the 9th Senate was passionate about delivering some of the targets in its legislative agenda before the 2023 elections.
