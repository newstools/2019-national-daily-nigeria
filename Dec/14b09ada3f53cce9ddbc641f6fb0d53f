Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami has revealed why the federal government didn’t order the release of Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, and why it cannot order it.
Malami said the case is being prosecuted by the Kaduna State government and as such, the federal government would not interfere.
”The Federal Government won’t interfere in a judicial process that is solely responsible for the state government to take charge of”, the AGF stated in an interview with the VOA Hausa Service Thursday.
But former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, and #RevolutionNow convener, Omoyele Sowore, were released on Tuesday.
Malami advised them to observe the terms of their bail and refrain from engaging in any act that is inimical to public peace and national security as well as their ongoing trial “which will run its course in accordance with the laws of the land”.
El-Zakzaky was arrested after a bloody confrontation betwee his group and the Nigerian  Army in Zaria in 2016.
In spite of court orders granting him bail, the DSS has refused to let him off.
