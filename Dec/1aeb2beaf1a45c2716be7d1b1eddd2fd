The seat and position of convicted Senate Chief Whip and former Governor Orji Uzor Kalu remain as he servse 12 years in jail for stealing N7.65bn when he was Abia governor.
Victor Etie, Esq. Kalu’s lawyer, who spoke with newsmen while reacting in an interview on Thursday, faulted the judgement, insisting that it was unknown to law and cannot stand.
“Kalu remains a Senator and Senate Chief Whip, the position and office as Senator are not affected”, he said.
According to him, the conviction is just a temporal distraction from Kalu’s) legislative duty,
“We are challenging it. and we are sure of victory just like the Tribunal case. The ruling cannot stand,”
“How can you say a company (Slok) that has been in existence before he became governor should be wound up? Does it make sense?”
Kalu and two others were found guilty of N7.65bn fraud by the Federal High Court in Lagos, presided by Justice Mohammed Idris.
Kalu’s co-defendants are his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited and Udeh Udeogu. Udeogu was the Director of Finance and Accounts at the Abia State Government House during Kalu’s tenure as governor.
