Sambo Dasuki (Rtd) (as recently varied by the Court of Appeal) and the bail granted to Omoyele Sowore, I have directed the State Security Services to comply with the order granting bail to the Defendants and effect their release.
“I wish to reiterate again the utmost regard of my office for the entire judicial structure of Nigeria.
