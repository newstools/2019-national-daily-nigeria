Chelsea’s squad to tackle Lille in today’s UEFA Champions League fixture at Stamford Bridge has been revealed.
According to the manager of Chelsea, Frank Lampard, defender, Antonio Rudiger is ready and fit to play against the Ligue 1 side.
Lampard’s men will be without their two key players, Fikayo Tomori and Olivier Giroud when they take on Lille due to lack of ‘match fitness’.
The Blues head to the game following a 3-1 defeat to Everton in the Premier League last weekend.
Below is Chelsea’s provisional squad against Lille:
Kepa, Andreas Christensen, Jorginho, N’Golo Kante, Tammy Abraham, Willian, Pedro, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Willy Caballero, Kurt Zouma, Mateo Kovacic, Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic, Michy Batshuayi, Reece James, Cesar Azpilicueta, Jamie Cumming, Emerson.
The kick-off time for the match is 9 pm.
