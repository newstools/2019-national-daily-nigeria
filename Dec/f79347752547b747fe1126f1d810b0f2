Imo’s former Gov Rochas Okorocha has opened up on the fight between him and Adams Oshiomhole, the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC.
According to him, it is still a mystery to him.
“One day, the opportunity may occur that I might hear from Adams what really went wrong because till today I am very much confused as to what went wrong,’ he said while featuring on Channels Television programme Newsnight.
“I have tried to make an excuse for him that probably somebody must have gossiped or do something that he believed.”
Okorocha, now a senator and  Chairman, Senate Committee on Culture and Tourism, also added that he won’t leave the “APC and if he will, it is not in his immediate plans because the party is more like a family to him.”
“If I was told in my dream that I’ll be treated this way, I’d have said it’s not possible.
“Or alternatively, it must be a search for political power or relevance or it would have been who he is.
“But whatever happened in APC was still like a dream to me, because APC had no reason to lose Imo state.”
The loyalists of Okorocha’s who left the party, including his son-in-law that wanted to be governor, are now returning to the former ruling party after its loss to the PDP.
