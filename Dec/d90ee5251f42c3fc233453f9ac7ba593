The dismissed policeman, Lukmon Akanbi, who allegedly killed Babatunde Adeniji, a fan of the popular artiste, Wizkid, is giving reasons why he committed the heinous crime.

Akanbi, a Sergeant in the Nigeria Police Force, allegedly shot dead Adeniji, a fun seeker, who was returning from Wizkid’s Concert in Lagos around 4:20am on Friday, December 27.

While being interrogated, the killer policeman was said to have regretted his action, saying he only fired the shot to scare Adeniji.

According to an inner source, Akanbi said Adeniji had engaged him in open confrontation, leading to a serious fracas, not minding the fact that he was with a pistol.

The source said the sergeant explained that he pulled the trigger out of provocation as he did not know what the deceased might be up to, saying, “but I did not intend to kill him.”

The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, has found Akanbi guilty of the crime and dismissed him immediately.

The Lagos State Police Spokesperson, Balla Elkana confirmed that “Akanbi has been handed over to the state CID, Yaba for prosecution in court.”

Meanwhile, Wizkid himself has vowed to get justice for Adeniji.
