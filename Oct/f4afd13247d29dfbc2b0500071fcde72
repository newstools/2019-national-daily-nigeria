National Daily gathered that Mesut Ozil has sent a defiant message to Arsenal fans to focus on the positives following defeat by Liverpool in the Carabao Cup.
The German made his third appearance of the season for the Gunners on Wednesday night and was Arsenal’s man of the match.
But despite two assists and a sensational touch that directly lead to summer-signing Gabriel Martinelli’s second, Gunners boss Unai Emery decided to once again hook the German.
Liverpool went on to win the frenetic fixture 5-4 on penalties after the match finished 5-5.
Taking to both Twitter and Instagram, Ozil wrote: “Crazy and incredible match.

“Losing on penalties is always tough, but definitely some positive things to take away from Anfield Road tonight. Thanks for the away support! Focus on Wolverhampton now!”
Emery spoke to the press following the fourth-round defeat, where he explained his thinking behind taking off Ozil.

“He played as we want, with experience and his skill to help the team,” Emery said.
“We decided beforehand that it was better for him to have a rest. He worked really well for 65 minutes.
“In my mind is the possibility to use him again [in the Premier League].”
On the match itself, he added: “We are sad but for our work, we deserve to have more. There are lots of positives to take.
“Defensively, both teams cannot be happy with that. But for the supporters it was an amazing 90 minutes. The result was always changing. It was spectacular.”
