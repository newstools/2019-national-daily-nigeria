Phil Foden has earned himself a place in the Guinness World Records 2020 for being the youngest player to win the Premier League,National Daily learnt.
In May 2018, aged 17 years and 350 days, the boyhood City fan knocked former City and Arsenal left-back Gael Clichy off his perch to take the record when he came on as a late substitute on the final day against Southampton.
The Under 17 World Cup winner did not feature from the bench in home games against Huddersfield and Brighton and was initially not given a winners’ medal when the trophy ceremony took place.
But he received his all-important fifth appearance late on at St Mary’s, where City’s last-gasp 1-0 win saw them become the only side to record 100 points in a Premier League campaign.
Foden got his hands on the first of two Premier League winners’ medals and now the 2017 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year winner’s achievement has been commemorated further.
