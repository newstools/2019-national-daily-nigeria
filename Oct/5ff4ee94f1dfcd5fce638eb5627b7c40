Nigeria Amputee Football team captain, Sarafadeen Olalekan Oyeleke, has urged Nigerians to keep supporting the team after their 2-1 victory over Cameroon at the ongoing Amputee Cup of Nations in Angola.
The Bursa defender who highlighted the team’s persistence character as the important tool to them getting a victory over the rival, believes their next opponent is not different, saying, they will not underrate them.
“We won today because we never give up even when we drew at first half, but later got the win towards the end of the second half.
“Thus, Tanzania are just like the Cameroonians who just came for the CANAF as their first experience.
“So, we are not underrating any club and we are putting all our effort to win every match.”
He also spoke about the importance of winning against the Tanzania Amputee Football team as it will enhance their chance of qualifying for the last four.
“Winning Tanzania tomorrow will give us 9 points and also remain number one on the top spot; also the outcome of other matches will give us the chances of qualifying to semifinal.
“Nigerians who are supporting us with prayers are highly appreciated and we still need more prayers and support to make the country proud,” he said.
The Special Eagles won their opening two games of the tournament in Angola and will be hoping to make it three over three when they face Tanzania.
