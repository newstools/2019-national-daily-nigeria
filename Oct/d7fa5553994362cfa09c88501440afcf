After the short ruling of the Supreme Court dismissing his client’s appeal without reason, Mike Ozekhome, one of the counsels to the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar has stated his position on he ruling.
And his positions doesn’t align with his client’s.
Atiku accepted the matter has come to an end, but he rejects the ruling, and describes the nation’s judiciary in no good terms.
“The Nigerian judiciary, just like every estate of our realm, has been sabotaged and undermined by an overreaching and dictatorial cabal, who have undone almost all the democratic progress the Peoples Democratic Party and its administrations nurtured for sixteen years, up until 2015,” Atiku stated in his reaction after the ruling.
But Ozekhome, a senior advocate of Nigeria, says the essence of the unanimous dismissal without reason is to to douse the tension gripping the nation as if it were an election period.
“As far as the justices are concerned, they have done the best they could under the strangulating regime of electoral jurisprudence,” he said.
“With the Supreme Court saying that the timeline provided in the Constitution is like the rock of Gibraltar, that cannot be moved, so you are being beaten, your hands are tied to the back and you are not even allowed to cry.
“Something drastic has to be done about our electoral laws and the electoral jurisprudence, so as to cleanse the stable and make people believe that when they vote, their votes would not only be counted but that such votes must also count.”
There had been lots of sabre-rattling and allegations about compromise and executive interference in the led-up to the final appeal by the PDP and Atiku.
An opposition group, CUPP, alleged the ruling APC had handpicked the judges that would sit on the matter, thereby provoking the apex court to respond by lashing out at the political group.
