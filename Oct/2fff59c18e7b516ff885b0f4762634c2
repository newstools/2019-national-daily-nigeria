The chairman of Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM), Innocent Ifediaso Chukwuma, has accepted a logo designed by a boy, Osuolale Farouq, who redesigned the company’s logo.

It should be noted that the said young man posted his redesign of the logo on twitter on Tuesday, October 15, giving full details and the idea that informed the new design.

The company noticed the design, retweeted it on his own page and asked its followers to judge and validate the new design. Though the new design on the Farouq’s page already gathered a lot of retweets and likes, followers on the company’s official twitter adjudged the new logo to be a very good one.

Meanwhile, pressmen earlier reported that the chairman of Innoson said the federal government, under President Muhammadu Buhari, has given enormous patronage and support to his firm. Chukwuma made the disclosure in an interview with the media in Nnewi, Anambra.

He also named Enugu, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Imo, Kogi, Anambra, Gombe, and Bauchi as well as Nigeria military among the states buying Innoson vehicles.

Chukwuma further said that if the patronage given to his firm, IVM is sustained, the company could transform Nigeria into vehicle manufacturing hub in Africa in no distant time. “I can say that Innoson vehicle manufacturing is doing well, especially with the level of patronage and support the company is enjoying under the present federal government. “I must equally say that some state governments like; Ekiti, Imo, Enugu, Ebonyi, Kogi, Gombe, Anambra and Bauchi are giving us a great boost,   ” he said
