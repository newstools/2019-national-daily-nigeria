The Assets Recovery Committee, after three months of inquiry, indicted the former Governor of Bauchi State, Mohammed Abubakar, over alleged misappropriation of state’s funds during his four years administration of the state on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
It was gathered 2019 after the inauguration of the incumbent that the Bauchi State Government had inaugurated a 21-member committee in July Governor on May 2019 to investigate the state’s finances from May 2007 to 2019.
The Committee was said to have made findings that N2 trillion revenue allocations from the federation account or derived revenue from the state’s IGR was received by the state during that period under review with no proof of expenditure.
It was indicated that the outcome of the committee’s investigation revealed that the former governor violated provisions of the state’s budget monitoring, price intelligence and public procurement law.
The committee was said to have considered the former governor’s action in the purchase of pubic assets morally condemnable. It was declared that efforts are being made by the state government to recover the assets.
However, the details are yet to be made public to ensure that the process and finding do not reflect political sentiments by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government.
