The crisis rocking the Edo state chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) took a new twist on Tuesday as the National Chairman of the party and former governor of the state, Adams Oshiomhole, accused incumbent governor, Godwin Obaseki of being responsible for the crisis in the party.
In a statement signed by Oshiomhole’s Chief Press Secretary, Simon Ebegbulem in Abuja, Oshiomhole said Obaseki was planning to dump APC, hence his reason for creating crisis in the state and blackmailing him.
He, however, advised Obaseki to focus on delivery of good governance to the people rather than blackmailing his personality.
The APC chairman said: “We have it on good authority that the governor (Obaseki) intends to create disaffection and crisis in the state, APC and probably dump the party for another party.
“That is why, he has embarked on this brigandary which Edo people will resist. So, he should stop blackmailing me and face governance which is why Edo people voted him into power.
“We are even more scared now that the governor is making every effort to coerce me into giving him details of my movement in Edo State. Who knows what he is plotting again. But every evil plot against me will fail.”
He alleged that the last Saturday’s siege at his residence by Obaseki’s thugs was a good example.
“Before that incident, state government sponsored thugs have been harassing, intimidating APC members across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state because APC leaders refused to adopt his second term aspiration.
“People are being sacked in their jobs every day in the state,” he said.
