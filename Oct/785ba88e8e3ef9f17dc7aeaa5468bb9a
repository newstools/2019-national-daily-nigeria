The Court of Appeal sitting in Benin City, Edo State, has adjourned indefinitely to prepare for  judgement on the suit brought before it  by Hon Momoh Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) praying the court  to upturn  the judgement of Edo State Election Petitions Tribunal which upheld the victory of Senator Francis Alimikhena  of the APC in the February election in Edo North Senatorial  District.
The appellate court after taking briefs from cousels to the parties in the suit challenging the tribunal’s judgement, declared indefinite adjournment  with the parting word that the court would notify all parties through their counsels when it decides the date for judgement.

Counsel to the Momoh Abubakar, G.C. Igbokwe SAN, had argued in his brief  that the tribunal was wrong in affirming the election of Francis Alimikhena Inspite of overwhelming evidence -documentary and Oral evidence – tendered  before the tribunal.
