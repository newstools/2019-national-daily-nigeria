The Golden Eaglets of Nigeria lost 1-0 to Japan in their last warm up game before the start of the FIFA U 17 World Cup on October 26 in Brazil.
A 22nd minute goal scored by Wakatsuki Yamato clinched victory for the Japanese side in the game played at the Sao Paulo Football Club ground in Coita, Sao Paulo on Sunday evening.
Eaglets tried to claw their way back into the game with an equaliser, but the tactical discipline of Japan and the resolute play in the defence frustrated the efforts of Eaglets’ attacking trio of  Olakunle Olusegun, Wisdom Ubani and Ibrahim Jabeer in the game.
Nigeria will play her opening game in group B in the 2019 Brazil U 17 World Cup against Hungary at the Goiania Estadio Olimpico on Saturday.
