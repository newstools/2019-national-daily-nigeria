The All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is gradually digging deeper into the depth of the northern oligarchy in the lobby for support for the 2023 presidential ticket of the ruling APC. The former Lagos State Governor has been eating into the structure of the northern oligarchy in peaceful, deploying all skills of political simulation and overture to gradually court the solidarity and endorsement of northern leaders, picking them one after the order to queue behind him in the power tussle for the 2023 presidential race.
From Senator Shehu Sani to former Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State, including the Seante President, Ahmad Lawan, Tinubu has continued to be the bride of northern political stalwarts in gradual sequence. Shehu Sani, Senator Shettima had made clear cases while Tinubu should be the successor to President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, while Senate President Lawan argued why APC should shift power to the south west in 2023.
The former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has joined the league of northern leaders subtly campaigning for Tinubu, to be president of Nigeria in 2023 after Buhari.
The former SGF was gathered to have said that Tinubu have the necessary leadership qualities that would make him good modern President in 2023 after President Buhari’s second tenure.
Babachir was cited to have said: “By 2023 when Buhari’s tenure will be over, he’ll go back to Daura to face…. But … every leader must leave behind a legacy. I will like to see that he leaves behind a legacy of achievement.
“Bola Tinubu is my friend of many years. Buhari is my big boss. Bola Tinubu without prejudice that he’s my friend, will make a good president. Other issues notwithstanding, he will make a good modern president because the presidency these days is scientific. Nigerians, by convention, seem to have agreed that there should be rotation of the presidency.”
