Ole Gunnar Solskjaer aimed a class jibe at Liverpool after their 1-1 draw in the famous derby, National Daily learnt.
Marcus Rashford’s hotly contested first-half goal was allowed after a VAR check for a foul by Victor Lindelof on Divock Origi, leading to many controversies.
However, Solskjaer was unmoved by criticism of referee Martin Atkinson or the VAR for letting the goal stand. And he hit back at them with a classic jibe on Liverpool.
“Foul? No chance, we’re not playing basketball. He touched him but it’s not a clear and obvious error,” said Solakjaer.
In case you missed it – Liverpool players had some basketball training ahead of Man Utd game and posted some photos on their official Twitter.
And some fans joked that Liverpool simply don’t need to train properly to face them.
