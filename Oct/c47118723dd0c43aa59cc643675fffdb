A witness told a Federal High Court in Abuja that
Former Director-General, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Bature Masari, allegedly transferred N9  to his bank account for three lawmakers, each getting N3m.
Testifying as fourth witness on Wednesday, Mr Habu Ozigi, Principal Partner of Kike Engineering Services, and staff of SMEDAN alleged that Masari transferred the amount on Nov. 28, 2014.
The EFCC is prosecuting Masari misappropriated N9 million constituency project funds, and of participating  in a N104.7 million money laundering.
Masari was arraigned by the EFCC on an amended 22 count charge bordering on alleged money laundering before Justice Okon Abang, after he was earlier arraigned on April 10, on 17 counts.
“ I did as directed and transferred three million each to two of the lawmakers.
“As I was about to transfer the last N3 million to the third lawmaker, I received a phone call from the former director general not to do so.
“He then directed me to transfer the remaining money back to his account and I promptly did on Dec. 2, 2014.
“I know the lawmakers. They visted my former boss in his office just like other National Assembly members in respect of their constituency projects,” said.
After listening to the testimony, trial judge, Justice Okon Abang, adjourned the matter until Nov. 4 for further cross examination and continuation of trial.
