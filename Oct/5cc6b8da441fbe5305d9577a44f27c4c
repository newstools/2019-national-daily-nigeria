First Lady Aisha Buhari as confirmed she was the one nagging like a fishwife in a trending video where she was locked out somewhere inside the Aso Rock Villa.
In a chat with newsmen on her return from the UK on Sunday, Aisha said she got angry after a disagreement with Mamman Daura, the president’s cousin, some months ago.
“This is the villa. We have over 200 soldiers guarding us, over 200 policemen. Why do you have to lock this door? What for, what for? Enough is enough. Let me know when you are leaving this place, let me know,” she shouted in the clip.
“The video was an old video. The event happened. It was me…actually, it happened in the villa.”
But in a happy-hereafter version of the story, the first lady explained how it is heir family tradition to vacate abroad, and stay couple moths with their children.
“I have taken my holiday for this year and it happened that after the holiday, I needed to attend to my health before going to Saudi.
“When I went to Saudi, based on doctor’s instruction, I went back to the UK.
“I am well now but still, I need more rest.” She thanked Nigerians for what she called their constant prayers for her and President Muhammadu Buhari.
Aisha returned amid rumors that her husband allegedly planned to marry the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster and Management, Sadiya Umar Farouq.
She relocated to the UK after an earlier trip to Saudi Arabia two months ago.
