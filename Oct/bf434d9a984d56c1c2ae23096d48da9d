The Lagos State Police Command says it has rescued another seven pregnant girls at Cele Bus Stop, Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, Lagos, Southwest Nigeria.
They were rescued on Wednesday.
Recall that Lagos State Police Command had at the weekend uncovered a baby factory and rescued 19 pregnant girls, with two suspects arrested.
Bala Elkana, the spokesman for the police in the state, said the girls used to ‘manufacture’ the babies were tricked with employment opportunities in Lagos as they were forced to get pregnant and their babies later sold.
They were recovered from four different locations including No 32 Owosho Street, Governor Road, Ikotun; No 29 Olugbeyohun Street, Olakunle Bus Stop Abaranja; No 4/6 Anomo Street, Abaranja and at the address mentioned earlier.
The pregnant women were brought from Rivers, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Abia, and Imo states.
He said the young girls were mostly abducted by the suspects for the purpose of getting them pregnant and selling the babies to potential buyers.
