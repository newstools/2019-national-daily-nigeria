The Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has felicitated with Nigerians, particularly youths on the occassion of Nigeria’s 59th Independence anniversary, urging them to join hands to build the country.
Dare explained that our country stands at the threshold of history under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari as the administration continues to correct the ills of the past and strives to bequeath a legacy of a prosperous Nigeria.”
He added that in line with the President’s vision of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, which he says is achievable if the country focuses on developing the youths that make up the chunk of the population, he said they (youths) will become globally competitive and equipped to contribute to national development, a drive he says he is fully committed to spearheading.
Hon. Dare further stated that the ministry had in pursuant to this, over the past few weeks since his assuming office, laid the building blocks of programmes that will not only rejuvenate sports but also develop the youths through a combination of empowerment and employment.
“An economically empowered youth, is an emancipated youth and the multiplier effect on the nation is better felt, than imagined. We are poised to delivering this, in line with the Presidential Mandate”, he said.
He urged Nigerians to focus on things that unite and deemphasize those that deepen division. “Bitterness, ethno-religious division and strife have no place in the prosperous Nigeria of our dreams”, he added.
“If we all do what is right within our sphere of influence, the New Nigeria we desire will rise. The occasion of our nation’s 59th Independence anniversary is a good time to remind ourselves that change begins with us”, the Minister concluded.
