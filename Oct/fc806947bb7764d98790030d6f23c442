Leaders of the five countries that constitute permanent members of the United Nations Organization (UNO) Security Council â€“ the United States of America (USA), France, the United Kingdom (UK), China and Russia have resolved to make a stunning appointment from Nigeria that many stakeholders in the polity perceived to ridicule President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The stakeholders in their perceptions ridiculed the Nigerian President and the ruling APC that such high profile global appointment is being proposed on a man they have so despised since they succeeded him in 2015; more essentially, with no contribution from the Nigerian government.
Reports indicate that the US, UK, France, Russia and China, in collaboration with the UN have arranged to appoint the former President of Nigeria, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, the U.N. Global Crises Envoy. Reports further indicated that the international job is isomorphic to the role assigned to Tony Blair after leaving office as UK Prime Minister. Blair appointed Middle East Envoy for the UN, European Union (EU), US and Russia. The intended appointment for the former Nigerian President was, however, identified to be a little higher than that of the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in that Jonathan is being assigned a broader role across the entire international system.
Reports also indicated that former President Jonathan would be the first African former President to be appointed into such global job.
The appointment is widely being celebrated to reflect fulfilled destiny of a man who started from university Lecturer to Commissioner in a state Government; from Commissioner to Deputy Governor, from Deputy Governor to Governor, from Governor to Vice President, from Vice President to Acting President and from Acting President to President. Now, from President to a World Leader!
