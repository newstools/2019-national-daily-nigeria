The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has disintegrated, and a new group, Congress of University Academics (CONUA), has emerged.
According to the national coordinator of the new union, Niyi Ismaheel, the lecturers decided to form the new group to redefine unionism and restore peace and stability in universities.
He spoke to reporters at its first national stakeholder forum at the Obafemi Awolowo University- Ile Ife (OAU).
Ismaheel said that the new union would form a new approach of engagement in addressing the welfare of its members and to put to an end “the unnecessary wasting of student’s academic time as a result of frequent strike action.”
Members are already forming chapter unions in Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Federal University, Oye Ekiti, Federal University, Lokoja and Kwara state university, Molete.
“The union is putting necessary documentation in place for official recognition by the university management and the government,” he added.
But the chance of it being registered is up in the air.
Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, confirmed that the union has applied to be registered by the ministry.
The minister said that he received their application in April this year, and a committee has been set up to look at their application.
“They have not been registered yet. Their application is in the ministry. They submitted it even before I left. They submitted the application in April. It has not been treated.”
ASUU has yet to respond officially to the development.
