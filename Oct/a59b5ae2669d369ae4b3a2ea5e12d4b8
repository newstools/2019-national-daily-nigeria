CEO of Dreams Football Club, Kurt Okraku has been elected as the new Ghana Football Association President after an intriguing election which ended few minutes ago.
Although the election was contested by six candidates, the main battle was obviously between George Afriyie and Kurt Okraku.
After the first round of voting, Mr. Kurt Okraku pulled a total of 44 votes as opposed to George Afriyie’s 40 votes which forced the election to round two since no one secured the maximum vote to get one touch victory.
In the second round, which was contested by only three candidates notably Mr. Kurt Okraku, George Afriyie and Nana Yaw Amponsah, Mr. Kurt Okraku secured 59 votes to emerge the winner after George conceded defeat.
Kurt Okraku now succeeds Kwasi Nyantakyi who was forced to step down after his corruptible practices were exposed in an exposè masterminded by renowned investigate journalist, Anas Aremeyaw Anas.
