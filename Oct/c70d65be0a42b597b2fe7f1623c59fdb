Eden Hazard netted his first goal for Real Madrid, as they beat Granada 4-2 at the Bernabeu on Saturday, to remain top of LaLiga.
Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez also scored, as Zinedine Zidane’s team extended their lead at the top of the table to four points.
Granada fought back from 3-0 down, with second half goals through Darwin Machis and Domingos Duarte, but failed to earn a point.
It was an important victory for Madrid, who drew 2-2 to Club Brugge at home in the Champions League in midweek.
Madrid defender, Dani Carvajal, did not hide his discomfort about conceding the two late goals.
“We can’t afford to suffer like that after leading 3-0, we need to correct this tendency. We got away with it today and against Levante but if we keep doing this we’re going to drop points,” he told reporters.
“It’s not a sign that we’re very reliable and we need to be more ruthless but whatever happens this weekend we’ll still be top.”
