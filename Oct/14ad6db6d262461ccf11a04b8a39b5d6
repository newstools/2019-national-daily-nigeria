According to a Central Bank of Nigeria report, the increased availability of secured credit to households in Q3 2019 came as a result of increased market share and high-risk appetite of lenders.
Essentially, the high-risk appetite of lenders means lenders are willing to take high chances when lending to households.
Meanwhile, the CBN report showed that secured loans to households are expected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2019. According to the CBN, this will be due to improving liquidity position and higher risk appetite of lenders.
While there was an increase in both unsecured and secured lending to households, lenders recorded lower losses given by default from households lending in Q3 2019 and this is expected to further improve in Q4 2019.
A quick look at the trend of unsecured credit to households over Q1 to Q3 2019 showed that despite the fluctuations in trend of approved loan applications, the availability of unsecured credit to households improved.
