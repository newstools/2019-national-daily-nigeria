A plethora of clubs have begun jostling for the signature of the Coach of Kwara United, Abdullahi Biffo, who is in Kano with his team in the ongoing Ahlan pre-season tournament.
Notable on the list of clubs is Wikki Tourists who approached the Ilorin-born coach just 24 hours after the head coach of the team, coach Zuberu Aliu threw in the towel.
Coach Abdullahi Biffo has clearly turned the fortunes of Kwara United around in a short space of time having beat teams like Sunshine FC, Kano Pillars, Rivers United, Lobi Stars, Wikki Tourists to mention a few in various pre-season tournaments.
This, of course, presents a clear indication of the hard work Coach Biffo has put in, in just a little over three weeks of assembling the team, with results to show for it.
Biffo, it would be recalled, has guided NPFL teams like Abia Warriors, Katsina United, and Niger Tornadoes. He has also led teams like Giwa FC and Niger Tornadoes to promotion to the elite league.
It remains to be seen if Coach Biffo will dump Kwara United close to the beginning of the new season or remain with the team he has nurtured with a lot of work.
