The Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Hon. Sunday Dare has tasked all hands to be on deck to move the Nigerian Professional Football League forward. He said this while speaking to journalists at the Moshood Abiola Stadium Abuja at the weekend.
He said, “Beyond just announcing that the league will start, there are some things we need to do and that’s been done already. While the league starts, the issues that have bedevilled the domestic league are under X-ray right now and we intend to attack them,” the minister said.
The Minister further stated that he is in consultation with a lot of stakeholders and would still in bring people with past experiences and mean well for Nigerian football. While also admitting there are factions in the league, he said, “I am trying reunite as many factions in the league, we are ready to work with them if only they are willing to improve”.
The Minister added that all interests would be weighed in the process, to separate national interests from personal interest. “If the interest is a national interest then we can move with those with national interests. Those who have personal interests, we will know.”
“The league is exceptionally critical, it is the strength of the young players who want to play professional outside the country. There are individuals who train young boys, who go straight out of the country and receive huge amounts of money which should have come to the league. We understand these dynamics and also understand that there are very divergent approaches and we are going to look at all the levels.”
The  Minister said: “we will do the hard talk and see what comes out.”
