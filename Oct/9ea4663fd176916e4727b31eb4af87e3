Emir of Kano, Mallam Muhammadu Sanusi 11, has commended Kano Governor Umar Ganduje’s new Free and Compulsory Education policy, describing it as something other states could borrow.
According to him,  it is one of the “greatest moves for serving humanity and I believe that this is genuinely initiated because of the zeal to serve Kano people and humanity in general.”
Sanusi has been worming his way into the governor’s heart since the state government moved to demote him for mismanaging N2b, an allegation trumped up against the emir after rubbishing Ganduje’s policies in his first term, and those of President Muhammadu Buhari.

In this latest twist, Sanusi made the commendation when the governor received, in his office, a delegation from the Zenith Bank led by the Regional Head, North West, Dr Sani Yahaya.

“This is exactly what this country needs. We need to place greater interest and commitment towards achieving that. Because education is the bedrock of any society,” he said.

What the governor is doing, according to him “…is exemplary, genuine and in the interest of our societal development. Other states should copy from His Excellency’s exemplary leadership.”




He added that it is extremely important for all and sundry to put heads together and contribute their quota towards achieving sustainable development in the education sector, which would translate into the overall development of the state and the country as a whole.
