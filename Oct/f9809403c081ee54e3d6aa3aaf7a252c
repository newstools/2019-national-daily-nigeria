Prof. Itse Sagay and Adams Oshiomhole, the national chairman of the APC had had sweetheart talks before, so it should not surprise many that the two APC politicians are about  clashing in the open, like always.
Only that Oshiomhole is trying to play the smart Dick, and the brickbat the PACAC chairman started would soon blow out.
Sagay recently claimed that Oshiomhole’s aggressive and combative leadership style has affected the party negatively. And Oshiomhole would no listen to his advice.
But this is not the first time the Marxist politico will turn up his nose, and spurn Sagay’s golden nuggets.
There was the first case.
“I do remember very well that he was one of those who said I should contest for President,” he told journalists in Abuja Thursday.
However, Oshiomhole promised not to respond to the allegation of combativeness in public.
“All I can tell you is that I have a lot of respect for Professor Itse Sagay.
“I respect him; he’s a very consistent fellow. He believes in what he believes in and he pays the price for it.
“If he has said those things, I’m not going to reply him through the newspapers. I will find out what he said.
“Then, I will call him and know what the issues are, what he’s not comfortable with. He is my brother and my elder statesman.”
