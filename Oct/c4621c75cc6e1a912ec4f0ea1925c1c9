Bulky stocky  striker, Ebenezer Odeyemi who last played for Kwara United has signed a new contract with Lobi  Stars Football Club of Makurdi,National Daily learnt.
It could be recalled that Ebenezer Odeyemi was in the colour of Kwara  United last season, and before that, two seasons ago, was with Niger Tornadoes.
The striker who has also played for the two time giants of CAF Champions League Enyimba FC of Aba, will start a new life in the ‘Pride of Benue’ in Makurdi the State’s capital precisely. It remains to be seen if Ebenezer Odeyemi will prove to be a player that can be relied upon to net in goals when the season commences.
It could also be recalled that Nzube Anazemba formerly of Kano Pillars too has joined Lobi Stars FC, while not forgetting the former Gombe United and Under-23 goalkeeper Emmanuel Daniel who just pitched tents with the Makurdi side after playing for Gombe United in the last season. All three players including Odeyemi joined Lobi Stars last week.
With a new gaffer at the helms of affairs in the person of coach Gbenga Ogunbote, who has a proven record of securing Continental tickets for clubs like Rangers International FC, Enyimba FC and Sunshine FC of Akure, the question now is; can he (Ogunbote) replicate the feat in Lobi Stars FC of Makurdi? Only time will tell.
