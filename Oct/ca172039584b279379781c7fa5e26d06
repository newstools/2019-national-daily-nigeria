Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to close the Nigerian borders beyond movement of goods or innocent citizens but also include killer foreign herdsmen invading Nigerian communities. The Benue governor, therefore, demanded the Federal Government to extend the border closure to include foreign herdsmen who have unfitted access into Nigerian territories with arms to attack communities, including those in Benue.
Governor Ortom during a visit on Monday to a female victim of herdsmen attacks whose limb was amputated at the weekend while working on her farm in Guma Local Council of Benue State, decried that Nigerians cannot afford to live in fear in their own country.
Ortom maintained his stance on banning all forms of open grazing in the country and establish ranches for coordination and security profiling of all those keeping herds of animals.
