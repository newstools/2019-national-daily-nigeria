Niger Delta Affairs Minister Godswill Akpabio has directed that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) suspends employment into the commission.
No letter of appointment should be issued either, according to a statement signed by Akpabio’s Chief Press Secretary, Anietie Ekong on Saturday.
This move may pit the minister against vested interest who have turned the commission to their honey pot.
Akpabio gave this directive in a letter issued by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, Mrs Didi Walson-Jack to the Acting Managing Director of the NDDC, Dr Akwagaga Enyia.
“Based on the Ministerial directive, the Commission’s pay roll should not accommodate new employees and should revert to the status quo as at August 31, 2019.
“The Minister should be furnished within three days with a detailed report of any employment exercise being undertaken by the Commission.
“The suspension exercise is to subsist until a due process evaluation of the purported exercise is carried out by the Ministry in consultation with the two NDDC Committees of the National Assembly and sought prompt action of the Acting Managing Director on the matter.”
The NDDC was just moved from the presidency, under the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, to the ministry.
The commission is one of the corrupt agencies in Nigeria, and its former bosses may go under probe soon.
