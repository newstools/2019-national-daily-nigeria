The First Lady of Nigeria, Hajia Aisha Buhari, arrived Nigeria from the United Kingdom (UK), at the weekend into a waiting funfair by some Nigerian women who gathered to receive her in Abuja with celebration, singing and dancing.
It wasn’t clear what the celebration was really about since Aisha Buhari has been traveling out of the country and returning home since her husband, President Muhammadu Buhari, assumed office in 2015.
There were indications that certain public issues in recent time in the polity may have added colour to the personality of the president’s wife, and establishing the heroin in her. The speculation of the president was planning to marry another wife last Friday pervaded the country. However, the speculated marriage with a minister in the president’s cabinet never held.
The episode generated solidarity for the First Lady while she was away. She became more popular and more acceptable than ever before across the country. Perhaps, the solidarity may have extended to the reception accorded her by the Nigerian women in Abuja on her return from the UK.
