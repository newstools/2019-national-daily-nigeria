Report reaching National Daily has it that Manchester United flop Alexis Sanchez reportedly pocketed nearly £5million in bonuses from his dismal campaign last season.
Sanchez was shipped out on loan to Inter Milan this summer after a dismal campaign for United which saw him score just two goals in 27 appearances.
Alexis Sanchez scored just five goals in a season and a half at United
The Chilean forward joined United to huge fanfare in January 2018, signing as the club’s top earner on £400,000.
But his performances never matched his pay packet and he left for Milan having scored just five times in 45 games for United.
His form left supporters baffled after he had dazzled for previous club Arsenal, scoring 80 goals in his three-and-a-half seasons at the Emirates and winning the club’s player of the season award twice.
Now it has emerged that despite flopping last season, he picked up a whopping £4,920,011 in performance-related bonuses and image rights, according to the Sun.
Inter are currently paying half of Sanchez’s wages after United managed to offload the 30-year-old during the summer.
However, he has been sidelined until at least Christmas after suffering a dislocated ankle while playing for Chile against Colombia.
It came just as the ex-Arsenal man had looked to be settling into life under Antonio Conte, having opened his Nerazzurri account in a 3-1 win over Sampdoria – a game in which he was also dismissed.
Prior to his latest setback, Sanchez claimed that he has rediscovered his “love for football again” after joining Inter.
But regardless of how successful his spell in Italy becomes, United do not want him to return to Old Trafford.
Solskjaer will be eager to offload Sanchez next summer
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side are prepared to offload the Chilean winger next summer and will demand at least £25million for him, according to the Sun.
