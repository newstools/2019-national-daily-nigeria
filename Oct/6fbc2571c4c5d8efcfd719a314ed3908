President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Aisha, has made revelations on the power tussle at the State House in the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
In an interview with BBC Hausa, Aisha Buhari again confirmed the viral video that circulated online last week.
The First Lady said she ranted after she was denied access to parts of the villa by Mamman Daura and his family.
Mamman Daura does not hold an official position in the Nigerian government but is regarded as one of the most powerful men in the presidency.
Aisha said: “I was the one in that video and this person you see standing at my back are my security personnel.
“It was Fatima, the daughter of Mamman Daura that shot the video in front of my security and everybody there. She was actually recording the whole thing right in front of me and was laughing and mocking me.
“They did that because my husband sacked them from the house. He told them to get all their belongings and leave the house for my son (Yusuf) to occupy.
“I left them and wanted to get to one of the rooms but they prevented me from getting through, I left them and took another way yet I met the store locked,” she added.
