Fresh off another successful Felabration hosting, Femi Kuti has popped up on a surprise collaboration with international powerhouse, Coldplay, titled, “Arabesque”.

Far from a stranger to international acclaim, bagging Grammy nominations, and performing all over the world, the veteran artiste and his band add a dimension previously unseen on Coldplay records, with a vibrant horn section that is unmistakably unique to the Afrobeat legend.

A legendary excerpt from the late, great Fela Kuti also features on the record, leading into a heart-stopping crescendo which closes out the song.

What a year for African music!

It was long ago some top African musicians collaborated with Beyounce on the Lion King project. Wizkid, Burna Boy and co were on that list supplying us lovely tunes such as Brown Skin Girls.

And we also heard how Davido blew our mind with Chris Brown.
