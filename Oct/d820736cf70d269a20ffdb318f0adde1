Report reaching National Daily indicates that Manchester United are reportedly eyeing a move for Lille midfielder Boubakary Soumare as a potential replacement for Paul Pogba.
Boubakary Soumare could perfectly step into Pogba’s shoes
Soumare, 20, has been likened to the Frenchman due to his physicality and rangy stature.
He was been watched by a host of clubs this season including United, who sent scouts to check on him against Valencia in the Champions League last week.
Soumare’s current deal with Lille expires in the summer and he could reach a pre-contract agreement in January.
While United are not looking to immediately replace Pogba, they believe Soumare, who is valued at around £30m, could be a long-term replacement.
National Daily learnt from the ESPN reports that United could make a move for the France youth star as part of a double raid.
The Red Devils remain interested in Lyon striker Moussa Dembele, who graduated from PSG’s academy, like Soumare.
Moussa Dembele remained a target for United
The former Fulham and Celtic man is believed to be open to a move back to the UK, with United registering an interest last summer.
 
Though Lyon are reluctant to do business but United could test their resolve with a January offer as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks to bring in attacking reinforcements.
