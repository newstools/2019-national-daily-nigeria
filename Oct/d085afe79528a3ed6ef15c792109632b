National team and Kwara United Football Club safe hands, Emmanuel Iwu, who won best goalkeeper at the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa pre-season season tournament earlier this month in Asaba, Delta State, sustained  injury in their friendly match against Kano Pillars.
The keeper explained that in  a corner kick won by Kano Pillars, he leapt high to punch the ball out but was hit with force on the arm by their striker.
The former Akwa United’s safe hand told our reporter that he  will be out for some weeks before he can return to the field of play.
