Angry youth in Edo descended on the APC Chairman Adams Oshiomhole residence  on the weekend, and the structure was gong to be attacked but for the intervention of police.
The Nation quoted Chief Press Secretary to Oshiomhole, Simon Ebegbulem, as saying the thugs, chanting Oshiomhole Ole,  were allegedly sent by Governor Godwin Obaseki.
But Special Adviser to Governor Obaseki on Media, Crusoe Osagie, debunked the allegation against his principal.
“The Edo State Government has said it has absolutely no knowledge of the purported attack on the person or the residence of former Governor of the state and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.
“We have no knowledge of the attack. We have also reached out to the Police, and they affirmed that they do not know about such an attack.”
In his reaction, Police Commissioner, Danmallam Abubakar, said, “It is a lie. There was no attack. Nothing happened in the area where Oshiomhole lives.”
Oshiomhole and baseki have been fighting cold war for over a year now. Efforts made so far party leaders to settle the differences  have yielded nothing.
