The EFCC raided the INEC office  in Gusau, Zamfara, and recovered four Ghana must-go bags filled with money on Wednesday.
The recovery, N65.5m,  was part of the investigation the anti-graft agency was carrying out on petitions against the election management body in the state.
“ The money comprises 81 bundle of N1000 notes, 97 bundle of N500 notes and 96 pieces of N500 notes,” the EFCC state in a tweet.
“The monies were stacked in two fire proof safes during a search conducted in offices of the HOD Accounts and Cashier of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Zamfara state.
There was an allegation of non payment of ad hoc staff who conducted the 2019 general election.
EFCC said the staff alleged that the Adhoc INEC officials were denied payment of their N6,000 movement allowances each for the two elections.
The anti-graft agency added that the suspects responsible will be charged and arraigned in court soon, adding that the money is suspected to be “40% illegally deducted on funds released to INEC Zamfara office to cater for the rent of Canopies, tables and chairs and also funds for RAC (Registration Area Center) and movement of men and materials to Polling Units, by the HOD Accounts & Cashier.”
