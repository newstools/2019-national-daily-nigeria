The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may have drawn a battle line with the All Progressives Congress (APC) over latter’s inordinate ambition to impeach Governor Dairus Ishaku of Taraba State about five months into his second tenure in the state.
It was learned that the High Commissioner of Nigeria to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Hassan Ardo, an APC chieftain, had demanded the Taraba State House of Assembly to commence
impeachment proceedings against Governor Dairus Ishaku for perceived gross misconduct.
The Nigerian diplomat was of the view that Governor Ishaku is violating the constitution, including misappropriation of funds and incompetence. Ardo, could not however, establish specific cases of misconduct against the governor.
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had cautioned that Governor Dairus Ishaku should not be distracted by a joke taken too far by a party still mourning huge losses it suffered in the last election in Taraba State. The PDP insisted that APC leaders have no basis for demanding impeachment of the Taraba State governor who has been responding positively to the people’s needs in the state since his re-election.
The PDP was said to have contended that the allegations raised by the APC are groundless, encouraging the governor not to be distracted.
The PDP maintained that Governor Ishaku has committed no impeachable offence, challenging the APC to establish their case with proof of their allegations.
