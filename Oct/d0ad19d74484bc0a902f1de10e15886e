Former Rep and Chief of Staff in Edo Patrick Obahiagbon, has congratulated Nigerians in his own speech on the 59th anniversary of  Nigeria’s independence.
Obahiagbon, aka Igodomigodo, is known for his jaw-dropping, tongue-twisting choice of words that usually provided comic relief in the lower house when his colleagues got steamed up debating issues.
A good old Victorian dictionary would do the reader a world of good understanding his anniversary speech.
Ignore some spellings.
Below is the full text,
“As we celebrate Nigeria’s autarky at 59,we must reflect on the urgent need to pull Nigeria out of its marshmallow of centrifugal excrescences that currently weighs against our centripetal agglutinants.
“The Sisyphean challenge to the pax nigeriana of our dreams, more than anything else, still remains our maladorous, putrescent, frankeinstous and opprobrious drift into a cocoon of ethnocentric chauvinism and syphilitic parapoism.
“Until we extirpate the hereinbefore mentioned gorgon medusa, all efforts at nation building amounts to vacuous sciamachy.
“Best wishes Nigeria
“~ Patrick Obahiagbon.
