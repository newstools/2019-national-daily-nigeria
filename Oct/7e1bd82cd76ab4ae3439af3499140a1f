The APC chairmen at state levels are ready to upset the party following the expiration of the 10-day ultimatum they gave the National Working Committee of the ruling party to look into their complaints.
The state chairmen want juicy appointments, and they will fight it out if the party doesn’t give them.
“When the time comes, you’ll hear from them—those who believe they worked hard for the party and have been left behind and out of the system while those who worked against the government and the party have been rewarded,’ Ben Nwoye,  APC chairman, Enugu and secretary to the chairmen association, told the Punch o Monday
“You will hear from those who participated in putting the government in place in various states and have been abandoned.”
The state chairmen have never heeded their lust for position in the ruing government and the national executive of the party.
They once banded up after the Senate principal officers election, asking Sen President Ahmed Lawan to offer them the job of mediating between the National Assembly and the executive.
When that failed, the pressed the Adams Oshiomhole-led national executive to job hem in to certain vacant positions at the national level.
Oshiomhole has not acted to their satisfaction, thus provoking them to stage a showdown.
