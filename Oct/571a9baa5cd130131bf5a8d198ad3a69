The names that will readily come to mind when one thinks of the two active greatest players at the moment is no doubt the Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo and the Argentine Lionel Messi.
These two superstars have redefined what positive rivalry means in a competition as they have both continually inspired each other. They are both captains of their respective nations.
National Daily gathered that Ronaldo has expressed his opinion on his rival’s in Messi replacement. The Portuguese talisman believes that his compatriot in Joao Felix is capable of replacing the Argentine in the long run.

The 19 year-old Felix currently features for Atletico Madrid and was snapped by the Los Rojiblancos this summer for a sum of £120 million. At about the same time, Griezmann joined Barcelona from Atletico Madrid for about the same sum.

Meanwhile, Messi did give a hint about his possible retirement but has made it clear that he will go on till the 2022 World Cup. One could see him hang up his boots after the Qatar World Cup. He would be 36 at that time and Felix would be 23, in his prime.

No doubt, Felix’s value is bound to increase in the coming years but with age on his side, he presents himself as a long-term option and a prospect for any side that he features for.
