Senator Dino Melaye againÂ  stole the show at the presentation of the 2020 budget proposal by President Muhammadu Buhari before the joint session of the National Assembly on Tuesday in Abuja.

While several other lawmakers were rushing to bow before the President, Senator Melaye quietly walked up to President Buhari, greeted him while holding back his hand, denying the President a warm handshake.

Senator Melaye refused to stretch out his arms to shake President Buhari. He, however, showed his bold face.

Senator Dino Melaye has been having from rough experiences with security operatives since the Buhari administration. He has also been a force to reckon with in the Senate.
