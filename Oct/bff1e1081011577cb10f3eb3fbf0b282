One of the longest-serving goalkeepers in the NPFL, Mustapha Aliko, has finally called it quit with the ‘Ikon Allah’ boys.
It could be recalled that Mustapha Aliko was the captain of the Niger Tornadoes who played in the finals of the Aiteo Cup last season and has finally said goodbye to the Niger Tornadoes team.
The decision of Mustafa Aliko who has been a goalkeeper of Niger Tornadoes for over a decade, to call it quits with the ‘Ikon Allah’ boys remains shrouded in mystery with many speculating that the move was necessitated by Niger Tornadoes playing second-tier football. Another speculation is that the second goalkeeper’s arrival at the club would keep Mustapha Aliko perpetually on the bench because of the new goalkeeper’s scintillating form.
Mustapha Aliko’s greatest strength no doubt remains that he is a good penalty stopper with good timing and flexibility.
He will surely be missed by the fans and football stakeholders of Niger state as he is presently with Kastina United also known as ‘Changi boys’
