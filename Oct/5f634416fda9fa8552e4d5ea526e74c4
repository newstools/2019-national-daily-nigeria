The General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Worldwide, Pastor Enoch Adeboye,  has spoken about the foray of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo into politics, and the consequent ordeals.
According to the spiritual father of the vice president, politics was an uncharted terrain for the professor of law and clergyman in the RCCG.
“He was not a politician,’ said Adeboye.
He spoke through his representative Ass.G.O  Ezekiel Odeyemiat at  a special service to mark the 20th anniversary of RCCG Province 7 headquarters (Faith Chapel), Gwarinpa, Abuja.
Making reference to 1 Samuel 9: 18 and 19, the RCCG leader compared Osinbajo’s emergence as vice president to that of Saul who became King of Israel without lobbying.
“I prayed with him (Osinbajo) a few moments ago, and God made me understand that before this man became a vice-presidential candidate, he never thought he could get to that position.”
He then predicted that Osinbajo will overcome the situation, noting that God doesn’t abandon whoever he promotes.
“If God destines you to be in a place even if 100 people are lined up before you, they will all be disqualified. If God is the one promoting you, he will sustain you there.”
Osinbajo has been reeling from one crisis to another since President Muhammadu inaugurate his cabinet and reshuffled some MDAs Osinabjo oversaw.
Many have considered this as a put-down on the V.P.–or some kind of resentment to certain decisions Osinbajo made in the Buhari governments anti-corruption drive.
But Adeboye  agreed  Nigeria is a nation where corruption is the order of the day.
If we must experience the next level of glory, we must make up our minds not to defile ourselves. We must determine to be incorruptible.”
Adeboye appealed to Nigerians to stop being negative about the country.
