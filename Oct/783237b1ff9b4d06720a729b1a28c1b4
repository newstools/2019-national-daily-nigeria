Vector The Viper, the rap artiste in a recent diss situation with M.I has agreed to battle M.I at the Eko Hotels for a monetary reward.

Singer Willie X.O asked that M.I and Vector put all their beef and dissing in the money-making rap battle.

According to Wilie, he is ready to put down N20m to see this happen. And that was the initial commitment but it just got raised by himself to N30m and he also announced that Hush Puppy is also adding N10m, making it N40m.

He has initially said, “Been following M.i and Vector’s beef. It’s a great time Nigerian hip-hop fans. The energy is dope. I say let’s drop the beefing and turn that energy into Mulla. I’m dropping ₦20million on the table for a faceoff rap battle between Vec and M.I, winner takes all. If you wanna add to the 20M, hit me up, let’s raise the stakes. Let’s take it to eko hotel! Young rappers open up and have M.i and Vector make this a classic showdown in Lagos. Gate fee go dey too o… Who’s coming?? #bigmulla @tundeednut @instablog9ja @mi_abaga @vectorthaviper”

But recently he made another video raising the money to N40m. To which Vector as accepted and all ears are now fixed on the Chocolate City’s corner.

Social media users have since taken to different platforms to share their thoughts on this asking many who they think will win the battle.
