Former NFF board member, Barrister Christopher Green, has said that the outcome of the Super Eagles friendly match against Brazil is a win for Nigeria.
He said this on NSM after the match in Singapore in which Nigeria played 1-1 with the Brazilian side.
“The statistics do not matter as far as I am concerned. A draw with Brazil is like a win for Nigeria. We have drawn plenty of positives from this match,” he said.
Commenting on some of the players’ performance in the match, he said “Joe Aribo was quite a revelation, with Oshimen coming of age and a good replacement for Ighalo. Uzoho is back in his elements.
“Nigeria relied on counter attacks with Pacy Chukwueze and Moses Simon. Our central attackers must keep pace with our wingers and learn some ball work as well as good interchange of positions”.
He added that Nigerian players must learn close control of the ball and fast thinking because of their pace, while urging the team to rely more on their skills, speed and strength, while minimizing physicality. “I’m sure the referee was an ex-footballer, if not, we would have suffered more fouls arising from our physicality”, he said.
“In all, we should keep our heads high and do more of tactical play. Congratulations to the team”, Barrister Green concluded.
