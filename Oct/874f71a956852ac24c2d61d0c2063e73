Chairperson of the Anti-sexual Harassment Committee of one of the universities exposed  in the trending documentary# SexforGrade by the BBC said that there was no evidence against the lecturers.
Ghana’s CitiNews reported Dr Margaret Amoakohene of the University of Ghana saying that there was no evidence that the lecturers slept with the students in order to give them better grades.
Two of the university’s profound lecturers, a Political Science lecturer, Prof. Ransford Gyampo and a lecturer at the College of Education, Dr. Paul Kwame Butakor were indicted in the ‘Sex for Grades’ exposé.
“If you look at the transcript that they added, there is no evidence of sex for grade. I agree that the lecturers misbehaved and so you will discuss these as unacceptable behaviours that should be investigated but there was no indication of sex for grades,’ she said.
“In one case, it was about the national service placement. Who needs grades at national service? She completed and she was looking for placement.”
