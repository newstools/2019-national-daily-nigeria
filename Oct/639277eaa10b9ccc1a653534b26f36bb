It’s a brilliant season for one Nigerian player in the French Ligue 1. Victor Osimhen, who recently had a hand in four goals this September for Lille, wins player of the month of September award. His fantastic start to life in Lille continues to bring glory to the player and his club.
Osimhen scored two and assisted two for Lille who won two league games, drew two and lost one in September.  He scored against Angers and Strasbourg and also grabbed two assists against Rennes and Strasbourg.

The 20-year-old striker beat the likes of Monaco forward Islam Slimani and Nantes defender Nicolas Pallois to win the award.  The Nigeria international has been impressive for Lille since he joined in the summer from Belgian club side Sporting Charleroi.
Victor Osimhen has scored eight goals in all competitions for Lille so far this season. Osimhen has scored seven league goals in nine games for the Great Danes this season with one in the Champions League which came against Chelsea.  In September, he also scored for the Super Eagles in their 2-2 draw against Ukraine in a friendly game.
With Kylian Mbappe back from Injury, all eyes will be on the French player to pick up from where Osimhen stopped (if he ever stops).
