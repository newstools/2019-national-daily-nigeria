“We have it on good authority that the All Progressives Congress APC-led Federal govt has been mounting undue pressure on the Chief Justice of the Federation and indeed the entire court to accept a handpicked panel and jettison the age-long tradition of the Court of selecting the most senior justices of the Supreme Court to sit on the panel.”
That is the latest alarm coming from the Conference of United Political Parties (CUPP), the arrowhead of the PDP fighting the loss of their candidate Atiku Abubakar in the last presidential election.
According to CUPP, quoting the provisions of the 4th alteration of the 1999 constitution as amended, the Supreme Court of Nigeria has 60 days from the date of the filing of the Notice of Appeal. 
“These processes have kick-started and everyone is awaiting the composition of the names of the 7 man panel by the Chief Justice of Nigeria,” it stated in a press release in Abuja on Thursday.
“The disquiet and bad blood caused by the APC in the Supreme Court now is a clear desecration of the highest temple of justice in the land.”
CUPP has refused to shed more light on the allegation–just as it did with others when the dispute was at the Appeal Court.
It however urged Nigerians to rise up, based on the current allegation, to oppose the move.
“The opposition and most Nigerians will not accept a handpicked panel neither will the pronouncement of such panel command the requite respect and confidence of the people of Nigeria and we in the opposition.
“A grave error was done at Appeal Court and the nation is waiting to see how a man who violated the Electoral Act and was supposed to have been disqualified managed to survive at the Appeal Court. That Court failed in both the issues of law and issues of national interest,” CUPP said.
