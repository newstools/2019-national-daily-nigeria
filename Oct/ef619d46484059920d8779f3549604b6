Reports reaching National Daily have it that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has remained under terrible pressure at Manchester United and Max Allegri has been touted as a potential replacement.
The former Juventus boss is currently out of work after leaving the Allianz Stadium at the end of last season.
United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is under increasing pressure to save his job after a run of poor results which has left the legendary club sitting 12th in the Premier League table hence suffering their worst start to a season in more than 30 years.

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who handed Solskjaer a three-year deal in March, is understood to be losing patience with the team’s woeful form.

But if Allegri is the man that United want to replace Solskjaer, they might have to act quickly largely because Massimiliano Allegri will reportedly refuse to take over Manchester United – unless he gets the job in the next few weeks National Daily learnt.
Meanwhile, Allegri is currently on a sabbatical and it is believed that he was not keen on the idea of taking over a club in the middle of a season.
It is reported that he would unlikely take the job if it was offered to him as late as December.
Any approach would have to be made in the next few weeks, meaning Woodward will have to make a decision on Solskjaer’s future imminently.
Taking the United job could be risky for a manager with a reputation as great as Allegri’s.
Former England midfielder Paul Merson recently claimed that a new manager would need £700million to spend in order to change the fortunes of the side.
“Who takes this job?” said Merson, speaking on The Debate on Sky Sports.
“This was a once in a lifetime job. You manage England, Man United and they are the two.
“Now, I wouldn’t see a queue round the block. They are a million miles off.
“This is a £700m job. If someone like Allegri came in, he would want £700m to spend. They need seven players.”
