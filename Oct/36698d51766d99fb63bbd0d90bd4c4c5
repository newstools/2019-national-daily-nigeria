Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State who led the All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign team to mobilize support of the partyâ€™s candidate in the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State, subtly mocked Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State who they were there to mobilize support for.
Governor El-Rufai, perhaps, unconsciously, ridiculed Governor Bello that his good works in Kogi State will secure victory for him and the APC in the governorship election. El-Rufai was speaking to Kogi indigenes who are also complaining of the many failures of Governor Bello in development of infrastructures and non-payment of salaries of workers in the state. These are in addition to the rising insecurity in the state.
The APC had inaugurated two national campaign councils to complement the efforts of campaign committees set up for the November 16 Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections, with Governors Nasir El-Rufai and Abubakar Badaru leading the councils, respectively.
