Early February, FCMB developed an initiative to empower women-owned SMEs with zero-interest rate on loans to support grow and expand small and medium enterprises in the country.
The zero-interest-rate loan targeted female business owners in Nigeria who need affordable and convenient funding to boost their respective businesses in a country where small and medium businesses are believed to be deprived of low-interest rate loan opportunity.
The development was in line with the commitment of the bank to empower women-owned SMEs (existing and starting) through financial support and advisory and value-added products to enhance customer experience and overall contribution to the growth of the country.
The bank has also announced the appointment of Olufemi Badeji as its new Executive Director – corporate and investment banking.
In a statement made available to the investing public, the lender disclosed that Badeji’s appointment had been approved by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), with effect from October 2, 2019.
Olufemi Badeji holds a BSc. degree (magna cum laude) in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in mathematics, from the University of Hartford, Connecticut, USA and an MSc. in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in computer and communications networks from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Manchester USA.
