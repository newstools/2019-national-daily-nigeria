Media accreditation process
Please note that the media accreditation process for any FIFA competition involves two steps:
Register for access to the FIFA Media Channel by logging on to: http://media.fifa.com/registration. You will then receive confirmation that you have been granted access to the FIFA Media Channel.
Once you have received your username and password, or if you are already registered, log on to: http://media.fifa.com. Select “FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Paraguay 2019™” from the “Events” section and complete the online media accreditation form.
TV/Radio
There is a separate accreditation process for FIFA Media Rights Licensees (MRL). The FIFA Broadcaster Servicing Team (BroadcasterServicing@fifa.org) will address it to the MRL via the usual communication channels.
Media representatives from non-rights-holding TV and Radio broadcasters (NRH) can apply for accreditation via the FIFA Media Channel. It must be stressed, however, that the number of NRH accreditations for the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Paraguay 2019™ will be very limited and subject to confirmation closer to the event.
Visa information.
Media representatives visiting Paraguay are advised that they may require a visa to enter the country and are responsible for making their own arrangements.
