Gusau, Zamfara State capital, was in mourning following a 17-year-old girl, Miss Aisha Bello’s death  after setting herself ablaze for not the inability to marry her heart-throb.
She was reported to have died on Wednesday evening at the Federal Medical Center, Gusau where she was rushed to for urgent medical attention immediately after setting herself ablaze in September.
Since she was admitted at the Federal Medical center hospital, (FMC) Gusau, the state government had been sponsoring her medical expenses.
The government had also promised to arrange for the marriage between Aisha and her suitor, who had no money to pay her bride price as soon as she recovered.
Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle had also assured the parents of the girl that his administration would pay for the marriage between Aisha and her suitor, Umar Faruku.
Hundreds of sympathisers attended the burial.
Her suitor, Faruku, was also at the burial, weeping over his loss.
“I lost the girl who died because of me and I don’t know what I will do with my life because I loved her so much.”
