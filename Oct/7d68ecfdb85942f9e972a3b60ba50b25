One of the seeming ‘misguided’ supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari, Dele Momodu, who perhaps, demonized former President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 general elections, has for the second time regretted his ignorance, like others, in the support for Buhari in 2015 and 2019 elections.
Momodu in a social media publication expressed his regrets and highlighted the disappointment those supporters have over supporting President Buhari, while celebrating former President Jonathan as a heroic leader.
Dele Momodu declared: “I must confess that at the height of our stupidity and naivety, in retrospect, we threw caution to the winds.
“We wrote off Goodluck Jonathan despite occasional flashes of genius and inspiration by some members of his team.
“In the meantime, former Nigerian Head of State, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (RTD.) was repackaged to smell like roses and we all fell for the promise of Eldorado he seemed to hold at the time.
“I was one of those who jumped on the bandwagon to describe him as a born-again Democrat, despite some strident and persistent warnings by then Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, and others. “Perhaps, we were fooled by the fact that in quick succession, he had picked Pentecostal Pastors Tunde Bakare and Yemi Osinbajo as his running mates in 2011 and 2015, respectively.
“Those who told us that our Hallelujah Choruses were premature and that a leopard can never change its spots were castigated and hounded by those of us who had been converted to what we believed was a new, improved Buhari.
“Anyone but Jonathan”, we sang, in unison.
“The Rest Is History….
“Nigerians should Apologise To Goodluck Jonathan.
Chief Dele Momodu”
