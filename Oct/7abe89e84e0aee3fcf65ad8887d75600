No less than five more aides to Bayelsa State governor, Seriake Dickson have resigned their positions ahead of the November 16 governorship election in the state.
The aides, who also withdrew their Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) membership, made their decisions known in a letter to the governor and the chairman of the party in the state.
The resigned aides are B. N Erewari-Igbeta, special adviser on Environment; Benjamin Ogbara, director, Ethics and Compliance, Due Process Bureau; Lawrence Ebede, special adviser; Natus Zebakame, special adviser on ICT Development and Iniruo Ipogi, special assistant on Students’ Affairs.
In a related development, the chairman of the state Sanitation Authority, Robert Enogha, was said to have also withdrawn his membership of the PDP.
The party’s legal adviser in Ekeremor Local Government Area, Omoro Ogei, was also said to have quit his position.
Meanwhile, none of them said they were defecting to the opposition party in the state, the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Many aides to the governor have resigned their positions recently.
Also, the PDP has lost some of its members to the APC over perceived crisis in the ruling party in the state, following the outcome of the party’s governorship election primaries.
