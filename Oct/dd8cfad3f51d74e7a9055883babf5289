Delta Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has said that his daughter, who was appointed as Special Assistant to the Governor on Girl Child, deserved the appointment.
He said this on Tuesday in Asaba, while addressing the issue of appointments into his cabinet for his second term in office.
According to him, he appointed only one of his daughters, contrary to rumours that he brought in both.
“Only one was appointed as S.A. to Governor on Girl Child and she rightly deserved it,” he said.
“We are trying to cut down our appointees this time around, obviously the number of appointees will be less than what we have in my first tenure.”
