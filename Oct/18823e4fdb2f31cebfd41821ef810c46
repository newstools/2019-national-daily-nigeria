President Muhammadu Buhari has denied having third term ambition. The President assured that he will limit himself to two terms in office and quit. He said he will never support the amendment of the constitution for a third term, noting that such effort failed in the past. President Buhari, therefore, dissociated himself from people campaigning for him to go for third term in office.

Buhari in a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, indicated that the Presidency wishes to correct internet-based gossip and un-informed media commentary regarding presidential term limits, given credence by so-called support groups, staging street demonstrations asking President Muhammadu Buhari to do a third term.
 
The statement reads: “There are no circumstances – nor set of circumstances – under which President Buhari may seek to amend the Constitution regarding the two-term term limit on holding office as President.
“President Buhari intends to serve his full second elected term in office, ending 2023 – and then there shall be a general election in which he will not be a candidate.
“There is not even the faintest possibility that this will change.
“It is important to note that there was a past attempt to change the Constitution to allow for the-then incumbent president to stand for a third term. That attempt was wrong, unconstitutional – and rightly rebuffed. No such attempt will happen under this President.
“President Buhari is a democrat. He respects the Constitution. Any activity aimed at altering the two-term limit will not succeed and shall never have his time nor support. ”
