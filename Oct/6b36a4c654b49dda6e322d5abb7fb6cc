Former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has mocked the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the poor leadership the party has in the various arms of leadership in the governance of Nigeria. The former Senate President also ridiculed the rulingparty for the leadership it positioned in government in the legislature that is failing to check the excesses of bad governance and anti-people policies.
Saraki recalled that his leadership of the Senate was able to challenge and, sometimes, reversed some of the anti-people policies of the executive. He noted that the current leadership of the National Assembly has, unfortunately, failed in this responsibility.
Saraki lamented the multiple taxation and levies the President Muhammadu Buhari administration plans to impose on Nigerians and the National Assembly assimilate all without critical evaluation or review.
The former Senate President declared in the social media as follows:
“They said the 8th Assembly under the watch of Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki as the Senate President is not a people’s oriented one.
“Under this 9th Assembly
