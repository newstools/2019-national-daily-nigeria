Several Nigerians have continued to commend Bishop David Oyedepo of ‘Winners Chapel’ for his donation of N650 million ($2 million dollar) for repair of public roads in Lagos and Ogun states. The Bishop is widely believed to have opened the gate for Church intervention in infrastructures rehabilitation, essentially, repairs of failed roads across the country.
Bishop Oyedepo, leader of the ‘Living Faith Church’ had approved N650 million for the repair of roads from the Old Toll Gate border link of Lagos and Ogun states, extending to  Idi-Iroko Expressway from Oju-Ore to Iyana-Iyesi and Sango Otta.
The road network has been in very bad form over the years with the Ogun State government, including the local government ignoring the busy road with high inter-state and international traffic.
A Nigerian citizen expressed: “I think more wealthy Nigerian pastors, business men and women, celebrities and politicians should borrow a leaf from what Bishop Oyedepo has done and also contribute their own quota to the growth and development of our dear Country, Nigeria.
“Remember we have no other Country except Nigeria, so it’s our collective duty to build it!”
