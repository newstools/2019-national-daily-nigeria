President Donald Trump of the United States of America has congratulated Nigeria on her 59th Independence Anniversary.
In his congratulatory message addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari, Trump addressed the areas of cooperation between Nigeria and the United States.
Trump’s letter, which was published by the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria, read in part: “We are allies in the global battle against terrorism, and we want to see Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa driven out of the region and other insurgencies like them dismantled.”
Dear Mr. President:
On behalf of the American people, I extend our warmest greetings and congratulate you on the 59th anniversary of Nigeria’s independence.
Nigeria is among our strongest partners in Africa. We share common goals of expanding trade and growing our economic relationship. We are allies in the global battle against terrorism, and we want to see Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa driven out of the region and other insurgencies like them dismantled. The United States welcomes efforts by your administration to diversify opportunities for your talented, creative, and hardworking people to the benefit of both our countries, Africa and the world.
I am pleased that following our meeting last year, our Vice Presidents are also building on our longstanding history of cooperation. I wish the people of Nigeria continued success as you mark another year of independence.
Sincerely,
Donald J. Trump.
