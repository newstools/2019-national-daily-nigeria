In terms of the amount involved, the sum of N18.94 billion was recorded as cases of fraud and forgeries in 2018 full year, with actual losses estimated at N2.21 billion.

The CBN 2018 report further shows that there is rising trend in payment channel fraud in the World. While providing details on the global trend, CBN noted that the U.S Bureau of Investigation had issued a warning to banks on a new type of fraud known as “the ATM Fraud or ATM Cloned Card fraud”.
Basically, the ATM cloned Card fraud involves hackers accessing bank systems or payment card processors and altering data in order to withdraw large sums of cash within a short period.
By the end of December 2018, various cyber-attacks had been carried out on high profile entities, including the Central Bank of Bahamas, Marriot Hotels, Google plus, Arik Air, British Airways and UK NHIS, leading to the loss of customers’ private information, revealing the vulnerability of all classes of organizations.
In order to tackle this trend in Nigeria, CBN noted that bank customers are continually sensitized on safe banking practices while banks are also encouraged to implement strong authentication controls and carry out comprehensive infrastructure risk assessments.
