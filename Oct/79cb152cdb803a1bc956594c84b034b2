29. Romelu Lukaku

Clubs: Chelsea, West Brom (loan), Everton (initial loan), Manchester United
Years active: 2011-2019

24. Virgil van Dijk

Clubs: Southampton, Liverpool
Years active: 2015-present
Imperious displays at Southampton developed the Dutchman’s reputation as one of the very best defenders in the division, before Liverpool bought him in January 2018 and turned him into one of the best in the world.
23. Sadio Mane

 19. Wayne Rooney

Clubs: Manchester United, Everton
Years active: 2010-2018
The forward’s best years were in the late 2000s, but his 26 goals almost helped Manchester United to the title in 2009/10 and he struck 27 when they narrowly missed out again two years later. He did win the league twice in the decade though
 18. Robin van Persie

Clubs: Arsenal, Manchester United
Years active: 2010-2015
Winning back-to-back Golden Boots with different clubs marks the Dutchman out as a modern day top-flight legend, with his arrival the catalyst for Manchester United’s 2012/13 title win.
17. Peter Cech

Clubs: Chelsea, Arsenal
Years active: 2010-2019
With two Premier League titles the previous decade, the Czech’s 2010s haul of two more and three Golden Glove awards mark him out as one of the best.

 14. Riyad Mahrez

Clubs: Leicester, Manchester City
Years active: 2014-present
Mesmeric when Leicester won the league, it is astonishing to think that the Foxes signed the 2015/16 PFA Player of the Year for just £450,000 back in January 2014. Four-and-a-half years on, they sold him for £60million.
13. John Terry

 10. Luis Suarez

Clubs: Liverpool
Years active: 2011-2014

8. James Milner

Clubs: Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool
Years active: 2010-present
Incredibly, the Yorkshireman was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009/10 season, and he’s still going strong 10 years later. He was Young Player of the Year in the same season, and after two league titles with Manchester City he’s going for another one with Liverpool.

The scorer of a record 172 Premier League goals across the last 10 years, the Argentinean is certainly responsible for the most dramatic moment of the era as he clinched the first of four league titles for Manchester City in the decade.
