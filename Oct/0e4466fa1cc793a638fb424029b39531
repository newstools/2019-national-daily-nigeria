The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, at the weekend, begged the people of Kogi State not to turn down the re-election of Governor Yahaya Bello at the polls during the November 16 governorship election in the state. The vice president was supported in the appeal by the national Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, and Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and others, begging voters in Kogi State not to reject Yahaya Bello and APC in the November governorship election.
Some stakeholders in Kogi State had expressed that the fear of Governor Belloâ€™s defeat had since gripped APC, forcing President Muhammadu Buhari to go on rescue mission by hurriedly requesting the Senate to approve N10.06 billion for Kogi State under the guise of refunding the state funds spent in repairing federal projects in the state. Many have challenged the president, the APC and Governor Bello to show the world where those projects are cited, protesting that the governor has not completed any project in the state since his inauguration.
Reports indicated that the APC governorship campaign flagged off in Kogi State for the governorship election attracted only scanty crowd. The campaign was said to be attended by only APC supporters in Kogi state. The Governors of Niger, Kwara, Yobe and Nasarawa states were said to be present at the campaign.
Governor Yahaya Bello is contesting the election with Edward Onoja, as his running mate.
