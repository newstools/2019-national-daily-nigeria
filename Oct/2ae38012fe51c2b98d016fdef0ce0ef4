Boko Haram plans to attack Ondo State have been allegedly uncovered by the Department of State Security, DSS.
A leaked letter addressed to the Commissioner of Police in the State, Undie Adie, by the DSS as regards the impending plan of the terrorist group, confirmed this.
According to the leaked memo, the insurgents will on November 1, 2019 attack Owo town, headquarters of Owo Local Government area of Ondo State.
Banks are among other facilities and towns the terrorists plan to strike.
While stating that the attacks were part of the group’s strategy to raise funds for the ongoing war in the North East, the letter also maintained that the group will engage in kidnappings and car-jacking.
“Intelligence availed the Command revealed planned armed robbery attacks on some banks in the state by suspected Boko Haram element from now,” the letter read in part.
“The group also plans to engage in kidnapping and car snatching along major routes in the state, including Owo-Benin axis, lsua lkare, and Auga-Ayere roads in an effort to raise funds for its terrorist/insurgence campaign in the country.
“It was further revealed tagged that the insurgents/terrorists hibernating between Kogi and Ondo States have concluded plans to launch an armed robbery attack on Owo town on November 1, 2019 being the market day.”
No official statement from either of the two security agencies yet.
