Nigeria Senate have indicted the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), accusing the agency of non-performance.
President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan bemoaned the inefficiency of the Nigerian Communications Commission, and therefore urged the agency to improve on its revenue earnings and service delivery to Nigerians.
Lawan, stated this as the upper house confirmed Adeleke Adewolu as executive commissioner on the Governing Board of the NCC.
He also warned that the continued use of unregistered lines by subscribers on various telecommunication networks poses serious security risk to the country.
“Let me say that the NCC has not done so well. We still have millions of people with lines that are not properly registered. This continues to be a security risk to us; the NCC needs to sit up.
“The revenues from NCC have not been meeting the target; so many of these operators don’t pay the proper taxes.
“The NCC, especially the management, must ensure that we get our revenue from these operators.
“Similarly, Nigerians don’t get the right services from these operators as their services are not reliable.
“We expect that by the time they have the full complement, they must ensure that Nigerians get the best of services and NCC should live up to its billings and mandate,” Lawan said.
