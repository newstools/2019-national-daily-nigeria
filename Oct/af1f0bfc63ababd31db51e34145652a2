The possible massive minimum of £100million price tag that Borussia Dortmund could slap on the England international may not be enough to discourage United in their pursuit.
Jadon Sancho has remained a top target for United in the their team rebuilding quest
The winger moved to the Bundesliga giants in 2017 after his chances of getting game time at United neighbours in Manchester City appear nearly nonexistent, having early been a part of the Watford academy.
Sancho has scored 18 times and made 30 assists in 68 appearances at Dortmund to earn his place on many European giants’ transfer wish lists.
Sancho has previously been linked with la liga giants Real Madrid – who are still searching for a Cristiano Ronaldo replacement.
“I can’t tell the future but I wouldn’t mind,” Sancho said earlier this year when asked about moving back to the Premier League. “La Liga I wouldn’t mind also, but we don’t know yet.”
“I feel that the coaches are believing in English players a lot more.
“My move to Germany has given the option to managers, to see that there is talent there and that they can give opportunities.
“There are a lot of good players coming up and hopefully we’ll win major things with England.
“I just hope everyone gets their opportunity.”
