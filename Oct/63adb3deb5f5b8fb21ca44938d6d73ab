Lawmaker Ugiagbe Dumez was arraigned by the Edo Police Command before the State Criminal Court on allegation of forgery and impersonation.
According to the police, Dumez, an Edo Assembly member, and one other person now at large allegedly committed the offence in 2001.
He was arraigned before Judge Ohimai Ovbiagele on six counts bordering on forgery and impersonation.
Dumez, 45, was alleged to have tampered with a document of the West African Senior School Certificate marked NGWASSCP 1230734 of December 2001 in the name of Ugiagbe Onaiwu Dumez, with examination No: 5131293070 by altering the original passport on it and superimposing his passport photograph on it.
The charge also accused Dumez of conspiring with the other suspect, on the run, to commit impersonation.
Similarly, with the intent to defraud, Dumez falsely represented himself to be the person whose passport photograph appears and wrote the same examination.
The offences are punishable under sections 21 (a) and 467 of the Criminal Code, Cap 48, vol. II, Laws of the Defunct Bendel State of Nigeria, 1976 as applicable in Edo State.
Justice Obviagele, adjourned the case until November 1, 2019 for the suspect to take his plea
