A BBC report has exposed a place called Cold Room in Unilag, where lecturers abuse students for grades. It is said that in the University of Lagos, lecturers allegedly take their turns, having sex with female students in the staff club that is referred to as ‘Cold Room’.
The BBC documentary, through its ‘Africa Eye’ initiative, detailed a sex-for-grade account as it affects two big Universities in West Africa (University of Lagos and University of Ghana. A student of the University of Lagos (Unilag) can be seen saying: “this thing has been going on for years. And every single year, every single department. Every single student. There’s always a story.”
To get the stories of sexual harassment out, BBC reporter Kiki Mordi and her team went undercover, speaking to lecturers and students in Nigeria and Ghana, while arming themselves with body or spy cameras. Professor Boniface Igbeneghu, a Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Arts; and a former Sub Dean of the University of Lagos (Unilag), could be seen in the documentary trying to sexually harass a BBC reporter who poses as a 17-year-old, while sharing tales of sex for grades with her.



The “17-year-old” wanted placement in Unilag and Boniface, strutting around the place with a pot belly, could be seen asking her to be obedient and telling her there will be consequences if she doesn’t continue to see him afterwards. “I can call you to come any day and if you don’t come, I know you are gone,” the Unilag Professor threatens.
Dr Paul Kwame Butakor of the College of Education, University of Ghana, was also seen in the footage, applying to be a female student’s ‘side boy’ or ‘assistant boyfriend’
