Ghana and Nigeria have agreed on the creation of a temporary corridor on Nigeria’s western border with Benin Republic where Ghanaian goods in transit can pass to avoid collateral damage arising from the closure of Nigeria’s borders with Benin.
Nigeria partially closed its borders with Benin and Niger Republics in August to curb the high spate of rice smuggling, which Africa’s most populous country said was threatening its attempt to boost local production.
The Ghanaian authorities are expected to provide further information on Ghanaian companies that do business in Nigeria, the goods and companies affected and those likely to be affected by the closure of the borders.
The decisions were reached when Ghana’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Shirley Botchwey, and Minister of Trade and Industry, Alan Kyerematen, held talks with their Nigerian counterparts on the border closure in Abuja this week.
While Botchwey met with Nigeria’s Foreign Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, Kyerematen held discussions with the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Abuja meetings were aimed at discussing further ways of providing a path towards resolving the challenges facing Ghanaian companies and traders following the closure of the border.
