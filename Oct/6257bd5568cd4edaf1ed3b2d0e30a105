Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Thursday shocked President Muhammadu Buhari with official visit at the Presidential Villa. The former President was said to have held a meeting with his successor at the State House, Aso Rock, Abuja.
The visit is coming after a long period of reports over the boycott of state functions organized by President Buhari by former Nigerian leaders, both Presidents and heads of state. The notable state functions included the inauguration of the President on May 29 after the 2019 general elections, as well as the June 12 anniversary.
Former President Jonathan was aid to have arrived the State House at about 3.00p.m and went straight to the President’s office.
