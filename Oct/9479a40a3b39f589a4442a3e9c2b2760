The Appeal Court on Friday nullified the election of Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye, and ordered a fresh poll be conducted.
Melaye (Kogi West-PDP) made the disclosure himself on his Twitter handle, hoping he will win the re-election.
“I just lost my election at the Appeal Court and fresh election ordered. In all things, I give God the praise. He who started the good thing will definitely complete it. I ask my supporters to be law-abiding as we shall always overcome. To God be the Glory,” he tweeted.
Melaye was declared winner of the February election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
However, Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress, APC, had challenged Melaye’s victory in court.
Adeyemi challenged Melaye’s victory on three grounds of irregularities, overvoting and non-compliance with the electoral acts.
The Kogi State National Assembly Election Tribunal had nullified Melaye’s election, though he appealed, through his counsel Rickey Tarfa.
But the Court of Appeal on Friday agreed with the tribunal and ordered a fresh election in Kogi West Senatorial District.
