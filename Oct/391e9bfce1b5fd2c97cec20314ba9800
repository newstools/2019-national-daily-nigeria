Ex-Manchester United manager David Moyes thinks the club must do everything in their powers to keep Paul Pogba at Old Trafford amid speculation linking him with a move to Real Madrid.
David Moyes sees Pogba as United best player
Pogba declared his interest in seeking a “new challenge” at the start of the summer, although in the end a transfer during the window did not materialize.
Some United supporters have been far from happy with the Frenchman’s attitude in recent months, but National Daily gathered that Moyes speaking to talkSPORT, has advised the club not to lose the World Cup winner.
“Pogba is still Manchester United’s best midfielder player,” he said.
“He could probably play for any team in the world, certainly in Europe. He’d get a game for any team.
“I’m not always sure he’s a player who’s consistent and makes the difference all the time. For the profile he’s got, you’re hoping he makes the difference. He doesn’t always make the difference, but do I think he should stay at Manchester United? Yes, I do.”
Paul Pogba could probably fit into any team in the world
There is still no word on when Pogba will make his return for United, and he was seen hobbling and using a crutch in the crowd for United’s game against Liverpool on Sunday.
Moyes is of the opinion that his former side need the 26-year-old back sooner rather than later if they are to turn around their poor recent form.
He added: “I don’t think he wins games like Messi does for Barceona or Ronaldo does for Juventus, but I still think hes a really talented player. He’s got a lot to give.
“Watching him at his best when he was at Juventus, he played a little it further forward, he got nearer the box more often.
“If you were picking the Manchester United team, Pogba would be in their midfield at the moment, that’s for sure.”
