My dearest Mother
You couldn’t just wait for me to come back before you sneaked away to the great beyond
Now all I have are beautiful loving Kodak memories of our times together
You tried for me, for us and many of the people who were privileged to encounter your kindness and your love
Thank you for allowing me take care of you
Thank you for being That Great Woman who gave birth to The Icon, CharlyBoy
Thank you for teaching me how to care, to love, to live a simple and humble Life
Thank you for constantly reminding me of my pedigree and my very Rich Heritage. I wish you would have waited
