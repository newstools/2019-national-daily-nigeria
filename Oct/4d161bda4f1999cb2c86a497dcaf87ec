Trailer drivers on Tuesday clashed with security operatives of the Presidential Task Force over the perennial extortions of the drivers by the task force and other allied interests around the wharf area at Apapa, Lagos.
It was learned that the allegations of bribery and non compliance with operational rules and regulations of activities in the wharf area by the taskforce team precipitated the conflagration.
It was said that the dispute began at the entry gate of the lilypond truck transit park which was set on fire, while the security operatives engaged in sporadic gun shots.
One person was said to have died in the fracas which erupted Tuesday evening while police vans and other vehicles were said to have been burnt.
