Chelsea fans in celebrations
        
 



National Daily gathered from the report by Daily Mail that Chelsea have emerged favourites to sign Leicester City left-back, Ben Chilwel
The Blues could step up their chase in January to sign the 22-year-old defender if they are allowed to make signings.
Ben Chilwell
Manchester United suffered the setback in their pursuit of Ben Chilwell after Chelsea emerged as the frontrunners to land the Leicester City left-back.
England international Chilwell is seen as one of the best full-backs in the Premier League and has spent his whole career with the Foxes.
The Red Devils are keen to bolster their defensive ranks and, despite boasting Luke Shaw at left-back, under-fire manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is believed to have identified Chilwell as his top target.
The Blues currently have a transfer ban for breaching FIFA rules on signing young players but have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Frank Lampard
And, should their two-transfer ban be overturned or reduced, Frank Lampard will look to bring the highly-rated Chilwell to Stamford Bridge.
The news will be a huge blow to Solskjaer, who is ready to splash £130million on Leicester duo James Maddison and Chilwell in January.
The Red Devils have endured a tough start to the season and currently sit 12th in the Premier League having only won twice so far this season.
Solskjaer is expected to dip into the transfer market in January in an attempt to strengthen his squad – with a striker his No.1 priority, having allowed Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku depart in the summer.
