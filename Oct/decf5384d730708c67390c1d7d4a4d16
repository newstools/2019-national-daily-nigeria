The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, appears to have covertly succumbed to Boko Haram and other resistance forces in the northeast Nigeria. The Army boss appears overwhelmed with the unending battle with violent groups across the country and is resorting to finding help from spiritual sources beside arms and ammunition to conquer the anti-state forces across the country.

Accordingly, the Chief of Army Staff on Monday organised Spiritual Warfare Seminar in Abuja on how to stimulate spiritual warfare on countering insurgency and violent extremism in Nigeria.

The event for the Nigerian Army held at 8.30am at the Nigerian Army Resource Centre, Asokoro, Abuja.
