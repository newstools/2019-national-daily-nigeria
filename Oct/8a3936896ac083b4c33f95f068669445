Report reaching National Daily has it that detectives attached to the Federal Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID), Alagbon, Ikoyi have on Wednesday October 23, finally uncovered the hotel where underage girls are used as commercial sex workers for as low as N500 and N1,000.
The bizarre hotel is located at Shimawa (a Lagos-Ogun border community). The detectives arrested two men alongside 14 underage girls claimed to have travelled down all the way from Akwa-Ibom, Kogi, Enugu and Imo states.
According to the girls, they were lured to the unfortunate hotel facility by friends from their respective villages for the ungodly practice and were consequently forced to remit as much as N1,000 daily to their boss for accommodation.

The crazier aspect is that the teenage girls are often forced to sleep with a minimum of four men daily at a fee ranging between N500 and N1,000 per client. Dementing as their tales may have appeared, the men (operators of the hotel) also force the girls to sleep with them any time it pleases them (the operators).

Those arrested at the hotel include its owner Gbenga Olayinka, his nephew Adekunle Oshineye, 28, three adult commercial sex workers- Happiness Daniel, Favour Nkume and Glory Ewelike- as well as nine underage girls.

The underage girls gave their names as their as Chisom Onyekwere, Chinonso Okoro, Stella Emmanuel, Gift Wada, Chidinma Emmanuel, Tracy Favour, Success Onu, Comfort Francis, Njoku Divine, Destiny Chibuike and Amanda Chima.

However, the owner of the facility as expected denied knowing some of the girls were underage. He also claimed that the girls rented the rooms in the hotel he has owned for two years on their own.

“I charge the girls N1,000 daily. I do not control them on their customers and I do not keep their money for them.”
