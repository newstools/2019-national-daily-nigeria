Arsenal need to be careful with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – trouble could be brewing.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has 49 goals in 75 matches for Arsenal to his name
It was gathered by National Daily findings that the Gabon forward has been effective since joining Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund and has scored a whopping 49 goals in 75 games for the Gunners, a strike-rate that is among the best in the business. That doesn’t take into account his assists, either.
However, just like Teemu Pukki at Norwich City, there is a feeling that if Aubameyang doesn’t find the net, then Arsenal struggle to find goals.
That’s why it’s imperative the club remains in the top four.
This way they can persuade their main striker that he can at least challenge for the game’s top prizes.
At present, Arsenal will be on the outside, looking in, as far as the title race is concerned. It’s touch-and-go whether they qualify for the Champions League next season, too.
So, failure could mean that Aubameyang decides to move on.
The former Borussia Dortmund star doesn’t have the same rapport with the crowd at the Emirates as some Arsenal legends of the past.
If I were Gunners coach Unai Emery, I would be wondering about an over-reliance on the forward.
He is also exactly the kind of striker with an incredible pace that Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp favours.
Arsenal fans so beware!
