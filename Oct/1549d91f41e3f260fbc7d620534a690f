Luis Suarez has been absolutely elegant for Barcelona for five years since checking-in from Liverpool for a reported transfer fee of 80 million euros. As it turns out, that money was certainly well spent as statistically the former Ajax Amsterdam and Liverpool striker has notched some superb numbers
With 184 goals and 97 assists to his credit in 257 appearances for the Catalans, Suarez has epitomized himself as a lethal goal scoring forward. However, now that the Uruguay international is 33 years old, Barcelona need to look at replacing him after he has significantly dropped in level and shown signs of slowing down.
Barcelona hitman Luis Suarez is edging closer to drawing his playing career curtain at Camp Nou
Paris Saint-Germain stalwart Kylian Mbappe, Inter Milan’s lethal frontman Lautaro Martinez and Red Bull Salzburg’s emerging talent Erling Braut Haaland have all been shortlisted by the defending La Liga champions. If they are to sign any of the three players, they will have to break the bank and that is for sure.
Messi has also given the approval to Barcelona to bring in Roberto Firmino from the Anfield as Luis Suarez’s replacement, but National Daily gathered from report by Fox Sports that Suarez himself has suggested that the club should rely on young Abel Ruiz, a La Masia product to fill-in his boots over the upcoming years
Suarez wants Abel Ruiz to step into his big shoes at Camp Nou
Abel Ruiz has made just one senior team appearance for Ernesto Valverde’s side, but he is growing in stock and it is only a matter of time before he is promoted to the first team. Ruiz was a regular fixture in starting elevens when Barca were touring Japan and the United States for pre-season and he did grab some goals for himself in the process.
Suarez suggestion has however left Barcelona fans contemplating if Abel Ruiz would successfully step into Luis Suarez’s shoes as their hitman at Barcelona.
