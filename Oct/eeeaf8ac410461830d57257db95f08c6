The most effective home remedies for preventing breast sagging and regaining their firmness include regular pectoral exercises, olive oil massaging, ice massaging, cucumber and egg mask, vegetable oils, and various essential oils.
According to MedLine Plus, the production of the female hormone, estrogen, in a womanâ€™s body gradually starts decreasing during menopause. This causes a shrinkage in the glandular tissue in breasts, making them appear less full.
Excessive consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages have all been associated with premature aging of the skin and weakening of the cellular structure. Therefore, it is suggested to cut down on these damaging agents in your body to see an improvement in the firmness of your breasts.
The best way to go about sagging breasts is through organic home remedies. They are very effective without any side effects and they are also less expensive. One relatively safe option is a formal operation, like breast firmness surgery.
One of the best ways to add firmness to breasts is through pectoral exercises. The easiest and most popular exercise is to do push-ups, which strengthens the pectoral muscles beneath the breasts. Overall, it will help in shaping up the breasts and reduce the excess fat deposits around the chest.
Lifting weights can also strengthen pectoral muscles, including arm curls, chest presses, dumbbell flys (on your back, arms out to the sides, rising above you), and there are many other variations that you can try to get your chest muscles working.
The benefits of yoga for the entire body have been widely studied, and it is primarily a mechanism of toning the body and increasing flexibility. Some of that toning can occur within the breasts, depending on which positions you commonly practice. Different yoga styles focus on different parts of the body, so those that focus on the upper body, shoulders, pectorals, or upper arms are the best for adding firmness to breasts.
Some of the best positions for strengthening the chest muscles are the Triangle Pose, the Cobra Pose, and the Standing Forward Bend. Certain yoga positions also battle the effects of gravity, which is a major component causing breasts sagging. Try headstands, backbends, and the inverted leg stretch to reverse some of the negative effects of gravity on your breasts.
Massage your breasts at least 2-3 times per week with olive oil. It will help add firmness to the skin as well as improve the skin tone and texture. It will also tone your chest and increase the elasticity of the skin.
Massage draws blood to the surface of the skin, and increased blood flow stimulates muscle growth, cell repair, and other beneficial activities that reduce the appearance and severity of sagging breasts.
There are some normal behaviors and physical activities that are unavoidable yet detrimental to the firmness of breasts. Excessive forward bending, jogging, and running can all speed up the sagging behavior of your breasts.
However, the benefits of jogging and running are well known, so many women still want to participate in these exercises. A solution is to buy appropriately sized sports bras that reduce movement of the breasts. Some women even wear two sports bras to completely isolate the breasts from excessive movement during jogging or other physical activities and sports.
Carrot oil, cypress oil, fennel oil, lemongrass oil, and spearmint oil are some of the essential oils that can also help or be used to increase the firmness of sagging breasts.
Do not use more than 2 drops and dilute in a carrier oil every time you massage the breast as they are very strong and can cause a burning sensation. It would be best to use them in a mixture along with other vegetable oils.
