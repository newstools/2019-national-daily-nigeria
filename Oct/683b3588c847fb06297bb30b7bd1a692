US President Donald Trump has confirmed the death of leader of the terrorist group, ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
This is the last and surest announcement about th death of the foremost terrorist on the planet.
Al-Baghdadi reportedly died after U.S. forces carried out an operation in Syria.
The mission came after the US got intelligence regarding Baghdadi in recent days.
The news came hours after the White House said late Saturday night that President Donald Trump would be making a “major statement” at 9 a.m. ET Sunday.
Speaking at the White House on Sunday, Trump said Al-Baghdadi died like a dog.
He stated that Al-Baghdadi died alongside three of his children after detonating a suicide vest.
Trump also thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Syrian Kurds for helping in the mission.
According to him, the Syrian Kurds gave the US helpful information.
Trump said, “Last night, the US brought the number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.
“He died after running into a dead end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. The compound had been cleared by this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed.
“Eleven young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel and he had dragged three of his young children with him.
“They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast.
“The tests on the remains confirmed it was al-Baghdadi.”
Baghddi death was similar to his predecessor Osama bin Laden whom the American Naval ZEAL took out in  a clandestine, cliffhanging op during former President Barrack Obama’s administration.
