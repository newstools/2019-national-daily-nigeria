Reports reaching National Daily reveal that Roman Abramovich’s trusted adviser Piet de Visser told Chelsea’s owner to keep Mason Mount at all costs.
Abramovich must keep Mason Mount at every cost
De Visser has worked as a scout for Chelsea since 2005 and has been involved in several one-on-one meetings with Abramovich to discuss potential transfers.
The Dutch scout played an integral role in bringing Kevin De Bruyne to Chelsea in 2012 and was upset when the club decided to sell the Belgian during Jose Mourinho‘s reign in 2014 as learnt by National Daily.

It was further gathered by National Daily that De Visser even made a personal intervention to keep De Bruyne at Stamford Bridge as he pleaded directly to Mourinho but Chelsea ended up allowing the midfielder to join Wolfsburg for £18 million.
According to National Daily findings from the Athletic, De Visser was keen to avoid a similar error and alerted Abramovich to Mount’s performances during his loan spell at Vitesse Arnhem in the 2017-18 campaign.

The 85-year-old is said to have told Abramovich to avoid repeating the same mistake he made with De Bruyne by selling Mount before he was given the chance to impress in the first team.
After spending last season on loan at Derby County, Mount has made an instant impact under Frank Lampard at Chelsea this season.
