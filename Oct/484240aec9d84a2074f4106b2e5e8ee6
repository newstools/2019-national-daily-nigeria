English club, Reading on Wednesday sacked their manager, José Gomes, following their 1-0 defeat to Bristol City in the Championship last weekend.
Reading made this known in a statement on the club’s official website on Wednesday afternoon.
The statement read: “Reading Football Club can announce that José Gomes has left his position as first-team manager.
“Gomes joined the club at the end of December 2018 and successfully steered the club away from the threat of relegation.
“However, following just two wins in the first 11 league games in 2019-20, owner Mr Yongge Dai has made the difficult decision to part with Gomes and make a change at first team level.
“We would like to sincerely thank José for his hard work during his tenure as manager at Reading Football Club and we wish him the very best of luck in his future career.
“The club will make no additional comment at this time but will provide further updates as soon as possible.”
