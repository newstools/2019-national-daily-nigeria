Buhari in marriage without consent of groom, bride?

There are emerging indicators of seeming shakeup in the hypothetical “Department of President’s Wives’ Affairs” in the Presidency.
Reports indicate that arrangements have been made for President Muhamadu Buhari to marry a new wife; the new wife is to displace the President’s popular wife, Hajia Aisha Buhari as First Lady of Nigeria.
The reports indicated that the marriage is scheduled to hold on Friday.
The reports, however, unconfirmed, insinuated that President Buhari may be marrying Sadia Umar Farouq, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Disaster Management.
Meanwhile, National Daily gathered that the Presidency had refuted the reports that President Buhari would be marrying a new wife on Friday. This probably culminated into the belief that the perpetrators of the president’s marriage ‘speculation’ may have imposed the marriage without the consent of the groom and the bride. Stakeholders who made this remark feel that this is one of the fake news against the president as in the case of the impostor president from Sudan.
There was another unconfirmed report that Hajia Aisha Buhari, the President’s wife, returned to Nigeria from her UK ‘holidays’ but was denied entrance to Aso Rock.
Meanwhile, National Daily monitors the development and would bring update on the reports.
