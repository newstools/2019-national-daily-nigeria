Unai Emery, Arsenal Manager
        
 


Two Italian giants, Inter Milan and AC Milan have joined the race to sign Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil in January transfer window.
According to Calciomercato, both Serie A clubs are exploring the possibility of doing a deal with Arsenal for Ozil next year.
Ozil’s current deal with the North London club will expire in 2021.
The ex-Germany international has fallen out of favour at Emirates since manager, Unai Emery took over from Arsene Wenger.
The 30-year-old only made just 24 Premier League appearances for the Gunners last season.
Ozil, who joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in the summer of 2013, has not been regular for Arsenal so far this campaign.
He also missed Arsenal’s 1-0 victory over Newcastle United in the Premier League some few days ago.
