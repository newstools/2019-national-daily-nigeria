Former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia, has accepted his fate after failing to receive the confirmation that his request for extension to the deadline date given to appeal the life ban placed on him by FIFA for bribery allegation was approved.
Siasia told National Daily that since nobody  is ready to help him, he has taken everything like that.
Reacting to report in the media on Thursday that Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has lifted the October 10, 2019 deadline date for appeal, the ex-international said nothing like that has happened.
He said that people are saying that his ban has been lifted. It has not been lifted.
“We were trying to get an extension before the date, but nothing like that. Nothing is going on at the moment, I guess it’s over, nobody want to help so let us leave it like that.
“Since the extension didn’t come before the date that means they are not giving the extension, if they didn’t give before the date then they are not giving.”
Siasia has pleaded with CAS in Switzerland to extend the October 10 deadline given to him to pay N36m before his case can be entertained.
He had gone to the sports arbitration panel to challenge the life ban imposed on him by the Federation of International Football (FIFA) in August.
Former U-23 coach concluded that he needs a 100,000 Swiss Francs which translates into about N36million to file the case at CAS.
