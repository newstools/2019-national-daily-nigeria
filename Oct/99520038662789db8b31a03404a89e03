Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Victor Wanyama, has said he worked hard to re-position himself in the team amidst speculations on his future in the last transfer window.
Admitting that his move from the North London club was shut, Wanyama said what remains now’s to figure and fight to win Mauricio Pochettino’s religion back.
“For me, I’m an expert player and, typically, you have got to attend till everything is finished. Things were smart, however, sadly, the transfer didn’t happen,” Wanyama said.
