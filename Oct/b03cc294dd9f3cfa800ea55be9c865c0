Nollywood star Bose Oladimeji is seeking divorce from her husband of two years because there’s no affection, no curdling, no foreplay–just savage sex every night.
And the husband also brutalises her in more ways.
“I just have to run for my life, my life is very precious to me,” she told the Vanguard.
“I’m leaving right now, I need to run away for my life. I need to save myself. My life will be in danger if I continue to stay with him, so I’m leaving right now,” she said.
“Whenever he’s drunk he’s out of his senses and starts misbehaving, beating me. He acts very crazy.
“He was taking good care of me and that was one of the reasons I fell in love with him. But what I found odd about him is the forceful way he has sex with. No foreplay, nothing, just to jump on me and forces his way through. No affection, no cuddling, no romance just brutal sex. I was raped like this most nights, and usually followed by beating and insults
“Any weapon he sees around he uses it on me but when he is sober he starts to regret whatever he has done. What I’m saying is that in the process of beating me what if I collapse and die or get injured, what will people say?” Bose said.
She advised ladies out there that they should not love a guy because of what he gives them.
“They should be sure the love is genuine and not be fooled by money and comfort.”
