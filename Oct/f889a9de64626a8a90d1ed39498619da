The Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has organized a three-day training program for highway sweepers’ supervisors in the state, to equip them with basic health and safety skills needed for optimal performance and safety at work.
According to the managing director of the agency, Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin, LAWMA was totally committed to ensuring good welfare and safety of highway sweepers, working relentlessly to ensure that every nook and cranny of the metropolis was cleaned up.
He noted that the three-day training provided a platform for proper re-orientation of the supervisors, who would impart the knowledge gained to the sweepers under their watch, adding that this would go a long way in implanting safety consciousness in the minds of the sweepers.
“The train-the-trainers program, apart from equipping our workers on the highways with the right health and safety techniques, would also pave way for improvement on the job being done, to ensure a cleaner and livable Lagos,” Dr. Gbadegesin said.
He urged the participants to imbibe the culture of safety consciousness in the course of their duties, stressing that most work-related accidents were caused by ignorance and carelessness.
During his presentation, Mr. Adeyinka Adebiyi, Director of Safety Training, Education and Skills Development, noted that the strategic training was packaged in a way that would be easy for the supervisors to transmit it to the sweepers under them.
He mentioned the dangers inherent in not following safety rules at work and urged the participants to pay necessary attention to health and safety tips in their assigned beats.
Different professional facilitators from relevant agencies also engaged the supervisors on key topics as “Basic Safety and Health at Work Place”, “Work Ethics and Environment”, and others.
