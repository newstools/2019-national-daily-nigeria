The 19-year-old has scored a remarkable 18 goals in 11 appearances this season, and after a recent illness, he climbed off the bench to notch Salzburg’s equaliser in this month’s Champions League clash with Liverpool at Anfield, which the Reds ultimately went on to win 4-3
Before that impressive performance, Norwegian Haaland scored his third hat-trick of the season in Salzburg’s 6-2 victory over Genk on Matchday 1 of the Champions League last month.

That form has led interest from Europe’s big guns, with Spanish publication AS claiming that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made the teenager his top target ahead of next season.

However United will face a battle with Madrid, who are also believed to be keen on bringing him to the Bernabeu.
It is claimed that Haaland ‘fits like a glove’ as Madrid are keen on finding a long-term replacement for Karim Benzema, who turns 31 in December.
Meanwhile Haaland says he is “bored” of the speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United among other clubs.
