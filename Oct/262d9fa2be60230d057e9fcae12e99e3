Neither the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) nor LaLiga want to play the Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid at the Camp Nou on October 26.

There are considerable fears over security for the match due to the ongoing political and social crisis in Catalonia following the rulings against nine Catalan political leaders.

The two clubs are against the proposal to play the fixture at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu instead and schedule the reverse fixture for the Camp Nou in March.

The Spanish government are also opposed to the idea of playing the match at the Camp Nou on October 26.

As a result, the authorities are looking for alternative dates to play the fixture and, as far as MARCA understand, December 18 would be the next best option.

December 18, which is a Wednesday, isn’t what LaLiga have asked for, but it’s the most suitable date for all parties.

The decision is in the hands of the RFEF’s Competition Committee and there will be a vote between three parties on Monday.

The only problem with this date is that it falls on the first round of the Copa del Rey, but Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Valencia will not play due to their involvement in the Supercopa De Espana in January.
