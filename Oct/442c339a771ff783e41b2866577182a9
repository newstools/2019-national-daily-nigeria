Former President Goodluck Jonathan should prevail on President Muhammadu Buhari to release Sambo Dasuki, ex-NSA, from detention. After all, Jonathan and CBN Gov. Godwin Emefiele were also complicit in the allegation that keeps Dasuki in detention.
Jigawa’s former Gov Sule Lamido made the suggestion on Friday, a day after Jonathan dropped in on Buhari at Aso Rock, the first of such visit in four years.
Dasuki has been caged since 2015, and has been on trial for allegedly misappropriating $2.1 bn arms fund—to finance Jonathan’s campaign for a second term in 2015.
Lamido, in the suggestion posted on Facebook, wondered why Emefiele, in whose tenure the apex bank allegedly released the money, is free and serving in Buhari’s administration.
“I am sure former President Jonathan must have put in a word for his very loyal incarcerated NSA Dasuki who dutifully acted on his orders just as CBN Governor Emefiele acted dutifully on his orders to release the money,” said Lamido, referring to Jonathan’s eight-minute meeting with Buhari.
He even gave a veiled reference to Jonathan’s role in the affairs.
“Even President Buhari claimed that money was released from the Central Bank on instruction written on an ordinary piece of paper,” Mr Lamido said in the post
