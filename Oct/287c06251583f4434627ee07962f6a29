The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday alleged that a former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose threatened and compromised one of its witnesses.
The EFCC is prosecuting Fayose over alleged N2.2 billion money laundering in connection with his election as governor in 2014.
The trial was stalled on Friday when the case resumed before Justice CJ Aneke of the Federal High Court, Lagos, EFCC lawyer, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), informed the court that he would change the compromised witness to another.
According to Jacobs, the defendant went behind to meet and threaten the witness, Adewale Aladegbola, a bullion van driver with Zenith Bank, Ado Ekiti branch.
He added that as a result of the alleged threat, when Aladegbola appeared before Justice Mojisola Olatoregun, who was earlier hearing the case, the witness turned around in his testimony to give different evidence from what he wrote in his statement at the EFCC office during the investigation.
Jacobs further accused Fayose of attempting to pervert the course of justice, adding, that the former governor would have been facing a different charge by now if not for his intervention.
