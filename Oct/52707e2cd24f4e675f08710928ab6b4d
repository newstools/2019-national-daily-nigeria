Jose Mourinho says he’s looking for an ambitious project and a club that plays to win as he eyes a return to football management.
National Daily learnt that the former Manchester United boss has been linked with the Arsenal job in recent weeks as pressure mounts on Unai Emery.
Mourinho is reportedly keen on taking the reins in north London and becoming the first manager to enjoy domestic success with three different clubs in the Premier League.
Unai Emery has remained under immense pressure at Arsenal
Emery, who’s Arsenal side lost 5-4 on penalties to Liverpool after a 5-5 draw in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, isn’t in immediate danger of being sacked.
Arsenal threw away yet another two-goal lead within three days in their EFL cup defeat against Liverpool
But should the Gunners board be considering Mourinho as a possible replacement, the Portuguese has clearly outlined what he’s looking for in his next club in an interview on The Coaches’Voice
Mourinho said: “The only thing that I know is what I don’t want, and what I don’t want is crystal clear. What I want, the general profile of course, but I can’t say clubs or countries.
“I am quite pathological in this sense that I have to play to win, and then if I win or I don’t win that’s my problem, and the players’ and the club’s and the structure.
“But I need a project where the feeling is I play to win.
“If someone gives me a wonderful, incredible, amazing, 10-year contract and tells me ‘the objective of the team is to stay in the first part of the table, if you finish seventh or eighth or ninth it is perfect, that’s not for me.
“That’s my nature. Of course sometimes I remember what I won before, but it’s not me, so my next is to fight to win.”
