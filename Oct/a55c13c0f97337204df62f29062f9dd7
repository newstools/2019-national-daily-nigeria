Frenkie de Jong is conscious of the importance of Barcelona’s Champions League clash with Inter Milan at Camp Nou. He spoke to Gazzetta dello Sport before the game.
“When I think of Inter I think of Wesley Sneijder and the team that won the treble,” said De Jong. “It will be a hard game for us tonight because Inter have a great team, they have improved a lot.”
The Dutchman also praised Antonio Conte. “He’s a supermanager, winning titles with Chelsea and Juve, and now has started well at Inter. He will have some surprises up his sleeve, so we have to be smart.”
“We miss him and that’s normal as he’s the best player in the world, but without him we have sufficient qualities and ideas to impose ourselves on the pitch. We’re a bit weaker but we’re still an excellent team.
“Playing with Leo is easier, he does everything well. When he gives you the ball it’s as if it has instructions with it and you have to do it. What he does with the ball is impressive but not surprising, given he’s been doing that for years.”
