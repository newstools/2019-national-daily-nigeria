Former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Prof. Attahiru Jega, has advised the federal government to use recovered loot to develop national social security to alleviate hardship in Nigeria.
Jega, a professor of political science disclosed this at a lecture organised by the Hudaibiyya Centre at the Aminu Kano College of Legal and Islamic Studies in Kano.
Jega who also advised Nigerians to vote out bad leaders, if they are not implementing policies that will enhance the living standard of the people, stressed that every Nigerian deserves a better life and it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that.
He said it was unfortunate that responsiveness, leaders’ nonchalant attitude to the masses woes thrive in Nigeria, ‘‘whereas these are what other nations have been fighting to erase from their system.
“If a leader fails, it is up to the public to ensure that they vote them out”.
Jega, the 62 year-old academic added that there is an urgent need for the Buhari-led administration to come up with measures that would address insecurity and instability in various sectors of the nation.
