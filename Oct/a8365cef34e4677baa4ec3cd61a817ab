The Egypt international limped out of the Reds’ dramatic victory over Leicester on Saturday but could be fit to face Manchester United on October 20
National Daily confirmed that the Liverpool talisman has avoided serious injury following Liverpool’s victory over Leicester City on Saturday.
The Egyptian was forced off after a challenge from Foxes midfielder Hamza Choudhury in the closing stages of the Reds’ 2-1 win at Anfield.

Salah left the ground limping, while manager Jurgen Klopp condemned Choudhury’s tackle as “dangerous as hell” while urging the England Under-21 man to calm down.
Fortunately for Liverpool, initial scans show no significant injury beyond a twisted left ankle, with no ligament damage or fracture leaving the Reds fans in wild jubilation.

Salah will continue to be monitored closely at Melwood this week, but Liverpool sources have told Goal that he could yet feature in the Reds’ next game, away at Manchester United on October 20.
His recovery will be aided by the fact that he has already been excused from international duty with Egypt in their forthcoming friendly against Botswana.
