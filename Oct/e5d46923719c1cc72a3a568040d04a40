An ex-president of Benin Republic has shocked African leaders with a statement linking Nigeria’s allies in the Middle East to Boko Haram terrorism ravaging northeastern Nigerian for years now.
Nicephore Soglo made the revelation during the Constitutional Term Limits Summit in Niamey.
According to him, friends from Qatar and Saudi Arabia are the ones behind Boko Haram.
“Boko Haram is funded by our friends from Saudi Arabia and our friends from Qatar. Are we friends or not? Let’s tell ourselves the truth. We have to stand together,” he said.
“I’m optimistic we are going to win if we stand together,” Soglo was quoted as saying in report by The Cable.
The former president didn’t, however, go beyond that as he addressed other African leaders at the summit.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have never been known to be in any diplomatic crisis that could have created such.
Although conspiracy theorists will like to reason along the Islamization agenda of the Islamic states in Africa.
South Arabia is however a moderate Islamic state.
