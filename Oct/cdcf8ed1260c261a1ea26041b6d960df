First Lady Aisha Buhari has apologised to state’s first ladies over the viral video of the family rivalry between her and the Mamman Dauras circulating on social media.
She also apologised to her children and well-meaning Nigerians  for the embarrassment the video might have caused to the institution, NAN reports.
Mrs. Buhari made the disclosure on Wednesday when she received wife of State Governors, who paid her a welcome visit at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
She thanked her husband President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the appointment of some Special Assistants and Senior Special Assistants to assist in carrying out activities of her office.
According to her, the gesture will assist her to concentrate more in the home front.
However, the gesture, to many critics, is one of the many instants Buhari has eaten his word.
Before he became president, he said he would scrap the office of the first lady because it has no constitutional backing.
He is now staffing the unconstitutional office with more staff–and resources.
