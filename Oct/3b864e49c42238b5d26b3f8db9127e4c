English premiership giant, Chelsea, has revealed its plans to get two new strikers in January when the two-window transfer ban by FIFA would have lapsed.
The Blues are currently banned from signing players, but are confident that the suspension will be lifted in time for the winter window.
Should they be cleared, Frank Lampard will move for RB Leipzig’s Timo Werner and Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson.
Lampard wants to bring in another striker to help Tammy Abraham and has identified the duo.
The west London club were slapped with a two-window transfer ban by FIFA, which started at the end of last season and will carry through until next summer.
However, the club’s legal team are confident the ban could be suspended or overturned, after new evidence was presented to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
