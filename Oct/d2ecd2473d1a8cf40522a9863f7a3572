The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to deepen subtle intimidation of the Opposition in the country. The Sokoto Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) sustaining the intimidation arrested some INEC officials in Zamfara State which the All Progressives Congress (APC) lost to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections.
A statement by the EFCC indicated that the INEC officials arrested in Zamfara State include Hassan Sidi Aliyu, Administrative Secretary; Hussain Jafar Head of Operations; Abdullahi Yusuf Abubakar, State Accountant; and Abdulmumin Usman. They are being accused of conspiracy, breach of trust and criminal diversionÂ of Ad Hoc staff allowance to the tune of N84, 696,000.

He further alleged that what the Commission paid to them was different from what other states paid their Adhoc staff.
The Commission allegedly paid its staff the sum of N9000 in Zamfara while in other states like Sokoto State, the commission paid N12000 EFCC claimed.
