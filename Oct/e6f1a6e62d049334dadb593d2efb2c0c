Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has revealed why his team failed to pick the much needed three points from the Europa league clash with AZ Alkmaar which ended in 0-0 draw on Thursday.
While expressing his displeasure at match officials, over a late call for a penalty kick, Solskjaer felt his team should have been awarded a penalty against Arsenal on Monday and his anger against Alkmaar centred on Stijn Wuytens’ challenge on substitute Marcus Rashford 10 minutes from time.
“The linesman can look straight at the tackle, he wipes his foot and unfortunately for us we didn’t get it.
“There is no point me complaining but there will come a point where these decisions will turn our way. Today was down to the decision of the ref. We could be sat here smiling,” he told reporters after the game.
United failed to register a shot on target against Alkmaar and have now managed just seven goals in their last nine games.
“You create chances and score goals, it’s no point me saying they know themselves.
“I’m pleased with the boys, the debut of Brandon [Williams]. You can’t see any nerves, so brave. It’s a big, big plus,” the Norwegian added.
