The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has expressed fears that early warning signs indicate that there will be pockets of violence during the forthcoming November 16 governorship election in Kogi State.
This was revealed on Monday by the. Chairman of the Electoral Institute (TEI) of INEC, Prince Solomon Adedeji Soyebi, on the sideline of a Round Table and Policy Dialogue on Kogi election, organised in Abuja.
According to Prince Soyebi who said vote buying during the governorship election in Kogi State would be discouraged, the early warning signs of violence cannot be overlooked.
He said, “There are reports of violence which cannot be overlooked and anticipated vote buying in the state which INEC is working to curb.
“What we will do is to discourage potential vote buying by increasing the sanctity of the vote, if you vote now, it is difficult for another person to see it. So, where there is no evidence of voting, there will be no corresponding money coming after it. We have said it consistently, vote buying is more of a criminal offence than an electoral offence, the security apparatus have been dealing with this and would continue to deal with it,” Prince Soyebi added.
