Eight cows were struck dead by a thunderbolt  at Ikare-Akoko in Akoko North East Local Government Area of the state.
Weeks ago, no fewer than 30 died in a similar circumstance in a sacred grove at Ijare, Ondo.
But the latest incident was going to be covered as the herdsmen made effort to butcher the dead beefs for sale.
The herdsmen were said to have roasted and started selling them to butchers in Akoko area before they were caught.
The state governor has since banned sales of the beef.
The Director of Environmental Health Services in Akoko North-East Local Government, Mrs Yemisi Adeniyi and her counterpart from Akoko Northwest, Mr Ojo Anthony, said they had arrested some butchers from taking the cow meat to markets.
Adeniyi mobilised other experts on Thursday morning to the scene of the incident, seized the meat.
The health experts, therefore, cautioned the people of Akoko to stay away from beef in the next few days to avoid consumption of such traditionally and medically cow meat allegedly killed by the thunderstorm.
Also speaking, the Chairman of Butchers’ Association in Ikare, Mr Kabiru Ismaila, said he was working with government’s environmental health officials to ensure such cow meat was not sold in Akoko markets in the next few days.
