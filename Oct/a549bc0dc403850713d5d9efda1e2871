The Attah of Igala and President, Kogi State Traditional Council, HRM  Micheal Ameh Oboni II, has conferred an Igala traditional title on Governor Yahaya Bello, as the Oga-Onu-Ogu-Attah of the Igala kingdom.
The investiture was coming after Yahaya’s allies gifted the king a Rolls Royce, and all of that happened in about three weeks to the state guber election which the APC governor is contesting.
The governor’s rival, PDP’s Musa Wada, and his party have been complaining of intimidation by the ruling party.
And if anything, the governor’s good gesture that got him the favour of the trditionl ruler council chair will definitely amount to more favour in the lead-up to the election.
During the ceremony on Saturday at his palace, Oboni said the governor deserved the title.
According to the traditional ruler, those who were conferred with the traditional titles were well deserving sons and friends of Igala kingdom who have used their positions to add value to the lives of the people.
The governor thanked the royal father and the entire Igala kingdom for such a privileged gesture.
He revealed that since his visit to the Attah’s palace when he was to contest at the APC primaries in 2015, the traditional ruler adopted him as a son.
Yahaya pointed out that the people of the state, particularly the Igala, Ebira and Okun were all descendants from Kwararafa, adding that those who discriminate people of different ethnic and peddled ethnic bigotry were the real enemies mitigating the progress of the state.
Traditional titles were also conferred on the Deputy Governor of the State, Honourable Edward Onoja and the Secretary to the State Government Dr Mrs. Folashade Ayoade Arike as the Olimele-Attah and Omi Ekele-Attah of the Igala Kingdom respectively
