The federal government has fixed Tuesday, 15th of October for another rounds of meeting with labour leaders in the country on how to resolve the implementation of the new N30,000 minimum wage debacle.
This was the outcome of meeting between representatives of the federal government led by the Minister of Labour, Dr. Chris Ngige and leadership of organized labour on Monday in Abuja.
Speaking after the meeting, Ngige announced that there would be another meeting on Tuesday with heads of government agencies and parastatals, where their books would be opened for scrutiny to see what amount can actually be paid to workers.
“We met with the leadership of the organised labour movement on the implementation of the new N30,000 minimum wage and the consequential adjustment of salaries for civil servants.
“The meeting was an information-sharing from the previous meeting between the government and the labour leaders.
“We assured the union leaders that we would remain neutral in the whole negotiation and appealed to members of the union to show some understanding.”
Recalls that the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has directed its state councils to prepare for strike on Oct. 16 if negotiation breaks down again with Federal Government.
In a circular sent to state councils, signed by its General Secretary, Mr Emmanuel Ugboaja, NLC said it was a notice in case the proposed negotiations slated for Oct. 15 with the Federal Government broke down.
