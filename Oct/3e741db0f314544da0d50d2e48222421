The lawmaker representing Kano South Senatorial district, has described allegation of tribalism leveled against Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as mere distraction.
Sen. Kabiru Gaya advised Nigerians to dismiss such claims against the vice president.
Second republic lawmaker Junaid Mohammed alleged on Sunday in an interview  that Osinbajo was focusing on Yoruba and his church member while acting as President in the when President Muhammadu Buhari was sick in 2017.
But Gaya told State House Correspondents after a private meeting with Osinbajo on Tuesday that the allegation was unfounded and did not reflect the true position of things in the office of the vice president.
“I think the vice president should disregard this issue and continue working as the vice president and for Nigeria. I believe he should not be distracted,” he said
