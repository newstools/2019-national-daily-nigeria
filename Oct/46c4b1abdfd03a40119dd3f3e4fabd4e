It was an absorbing spectacle earlier today at the fortress at Nnewi ,venue for a pre season friendly between Oriental brothers, FC Ifeanyi Uba and Heartland FC of Owerri.
Both sides did put up good show for the fans and neutrals alike.
Coach Ilechukwu  made some changes but retained only two players (Chukwudi Nwaodu and Joshua Akahbue) who had played against Rangers and Warri Wolves .
About 10 minutes into the first half , the living legend, Ambassador Papilo KANU Nwankwo arrived to the surprise of all .

During the interval  ,Papilo went to the locker room where he encouraged the players to give 100% on the pitch irrespective of the venue of the encounter.
“You guys are playing well but we want you to execute every game as a home game because that is the tradition of this team”.
The second period was more explosive with Heartland turning the heat on the Nnewi lads. Chijioke Akunaeto, Onwuabuchi Chimakpa ,Tchato Giscad  and Promise Orji all forced a couple of saves from the Ifeanyi Uba ‘s keeper fondly called “Sharp”
In the end ,it ended in  an exciting scoreless draw. (0-0)
Speaking after the game ,Papilo commended Heartland for keeping their shape and possession despite playing away from home .He also commended Ilechukwu and his crew for their commitment to duty charging them not to relent until success is achieved.
The SSA to the Governor on sports had some kind words for the Chairman of the board (Chief Ezekwem)
“The present Heartland is blessed with a passionate and committed Chairman who is willing to sacrifice his time and resources in order to achieve success”
Technical Adviser Fidelis Ilechukwu promised that his team will continue to work hard to get the team ready for the league.
Okagbue echoed the same sentiment promising that his team is working hard to craft a formidable side for the new season.
