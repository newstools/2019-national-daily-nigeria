As many that are clamoring for a Yoruba presidency come 2023 might be disappointed, as far as talking goes.
A leader of the southwest foremost socio-cultural group Afenifere says the southwest doesn’t need it.
According to Ayo Adebanjo, the Igbo should deserve the topmost job in 2023—for the sake of unity.
“If you are keen about unity, will there be a unit of the country that you will deprive presidency? What does that mean for unity?” he said in an interview on ARISE TV.
He dismissed those people eager to have the next resident come from the Yoruba, saying nobody loves Nigeria and still asks  the presidency come to the South-west in 2023.
“That’s why I tell you all these people are not serious, including Buhari. Why should you exclude the South-east? Is South-east not part of Nigeria?” he said.
“South-west has had, South-south has had, the North has had, why exclude the South-east if you want them to be there? That is the point I was making earlier on.”
Afenifere supported the PDP flagbearer Goodluck Jonathan i the2015 election, and ex-V.P. Atiku Abubakar in te 2019 election.
There have been speculations the APC national leader Bola Tinubu is contemplating to run for presidency in 2023.
Rotational presidency has no constitutional backing in Nigeria, but parties adopt it to keep the elite in politics happy by letting each region has a taste of ruling the country, analysts say.
After former President Olusegun Obasanjo completed his second tenure in 2007, the Yoruba has been on the fringes of federal government, coming as close as the vice presidency in the last six years.
Foremost politicians in the region are now scrambling for the Yoruba return to federal power in 2013
