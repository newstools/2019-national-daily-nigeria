The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Tuesday accused the Nigerian police of shooting 17 of its members and abducted over 70 others.
The group disclosed this in a statement issued by its spokesman, Emma Powerful.
He said the incident happened at a venue where its members gathered for a meeting in Ebonyi State on Sunday.
The statement said: “We the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) find it distasteful that rather than confront rampaging and murderous Fulani herdsmen, the Nigerian Army, and police have continued their incessant and unwarranted attacks against the peaceful family of IPOB in Ebonyi State
” A combined team of security operatives invaded the venue of a peaceful IPOB gathering in Ebonyi LGA at 5:00 p.m. on Sunday 27 October 2019 with more than 50 Hilux vans during an inauguration ceremony and opened fire on defenceless mothers and fathers without warning
“Such mindless and animalistic brutality cannot happen and has never happened in the North where the top four most deadly terror groups are operating freely without restriction.
“The security operatives, opened fire on everybody at the venue of the meeting which resulted in many casualties. 17 people sustained severe gunshot wounds while over 70 people were abducted and taken to unknown location.”
