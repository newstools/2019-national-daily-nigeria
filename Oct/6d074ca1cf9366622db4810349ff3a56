While it is still a water cooler yarn at Aso Rock, the news is already out there—that President Muhammadu Buhari, pushing 80, is dumping his first lady to acquire a brand new wife.
She is Sadiaq Umar Farouq, minister of humanitarian affairs and disaster management.
Publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu, among others, just reacted to the ‘newsmour’.
“ Let me disappoint the rumour-mongers that nothing of the sort is happening tomorrow, according to my own impeccable sources… Fingers crossed…,” he tweeted on Friday.
According to the rumour-mongers, the reason for Buhari’s urgent need for love is loneliness.
The current First Lady, Aisha,has been out of the Presidential Villa since her trips to Saudi Arabia and UK.
Moreover,  Ms Farouk,  the rumor goes, is an old crush of Buhari’s,  and a darling of the Villa cabal
Momodu, however, has stuck out his neck to defend the president.
The publisher insisted there would be no such wedding between Buhari and Farouk.
