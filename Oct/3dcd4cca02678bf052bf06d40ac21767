A woman who was stabbed 17 times by her husband in Karatina, Nyeri County has withdrawn the assault charges.

Ms. Peninah Wangechi told Principal Magistrate Alice Mwangi at the Karatina Law Courts that she had forgiven her husband, Samuel Ndirangu, for the attack that occurred in April this year and would want the case withdrawn.

She insisted that she had made the decision out of her own free will, and had neither been threatened nor compelled to withdraw the case.

The woman also told the court that they no longer live together with the accused.

The magistrate granted the request and set Ndirangu free.

Wangechi, a mother of three had been stabbed 17 times on her back, chest and face following a domestic fight with her then husband.


She was admitted at the Karatina Sub-county Hospital where doctors said that though she had bled a lot, the knife wounds were fortunately not severe.

The suspect surrendered to the police after the attack and was detained at Karatina Police Station before being arraigned.
