After a disappointing relationship with the Watford soccer star, Jennifer Ajoke Oladehinde found love again and will start a new marital relationship with her new found love.
With Issac it wasn’t a good story as she felt betrayed when her baby father(Isaac Success) engaged his London girlfriend in May, without my knowledge. Iwas heart broken and had many devastating moments attempting suicide.
She loved Issac and they have been together for 7 years. a relationship that produce a 5,years old son. though information gathered tells a different line as she is not aware of Success plans for the other woman.
God’s blessings are strange, as Jennifer will be starting a new life with her new lover while Issac is getting marital relationships with someone else. whatever the case maybe we wish both parties a wonderful married life ahead.
