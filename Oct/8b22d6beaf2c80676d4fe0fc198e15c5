Manchester United may have endured a difficult start to the 2019/2020 English Premier League season, but the Red Devils have got reason to celebrate as they have yet set a new EPL record.

The above feat was achieved with McTominay’s goal as the strike has took the Old Trafford club’s goal tally to 2000 goals thereby setting a new EPL goal record.

Scott McTominay’s opening goal for Manchester United against Norwich City has seen the Red Devils set a Premier League record as they reached 2000 goals in the division.

The Scotland international midfielder scored midway through the first half to give his team the lead halfway through the first period in United’s Sunday evening visit to Carrow Road.

The goal was the club’s 2000th in the Premier League, and they are the first club to pass that figure.

It was the 22-year-old academy product’s fourth goal for the club and his scoring record, albeit early in his career, pales in comparison with some of the names on the list of the Old Trafford sides landmark goalscorers.

They opened their account in the competition through Mark Hughes in August 1992. The Wales international made 345 appearances for United over two spells, scoring 120 goals, though that particular strike came in a 2-1 loss to Sheffield United.

Andy Cole scored their 500th in the Premier League, during the most famous season of their storied history. Cole’s February 1999 goal, one of 93 he bagged in Manchester, was part of a season that saw them win the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League the first and so far only team to do so.

They reached 1,000 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo in 2005. The then 20-year-old was still finding his way at that stage of his career but has since gone on to be seen as one of the greatest players of all time.
