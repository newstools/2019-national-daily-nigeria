The Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Sunday  Dare, has noted that  the upcoming friendly match between Nigeria and Brazil would be a good test for the Super Eagles.
Reliable source told our reporter that  friendly match between three-times African champions, Super Eagles, and World Cup winners, Brazil will  take place at the Singapore National Stadium in Kallang on October 13.
The Minister explained that though the October 13th game was a friendly, there was a lot at stake for both countries, describing it as a good test for the Super Eagles.
“The game in Singapore is a friendly (match), but also it is a friendly that we think will test our boys to  see how prepared they are.”
He added  that the match will also show the strong departments of the Nigerian team and areas where they are weak, while adding that he looks forward to a very engaging and interesting game.
The Minister of Youths and Sports Developments refrained from making predictions however. He said “I am not one to predict matches, but I hope our boys will play excellently because we have got talents on that team and I know they will show what they have got on October the 13th.
The Super Eagles can beat the Brazil team, they are beatable, I  remember we defeated them in the  Olympics of  96,”  Hon. Sunday Dare concluded.
