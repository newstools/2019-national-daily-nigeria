No fewer than 200 inmates escaped a medium correctional centre in Koton-Karfe, Kogi Local Government Area of Kogi on Monday.
Some parts of the building housing the inmates had collapsed.
According to a prison source, 100 of the inmates have been rearrested, while unspecified number voluntarily returned.
The rain started around 2 am and lasted till early morning, leading to massive flood that destroyed many houses, including parts of the correctional centre, leading to the escape of the inmates.
The downpour led to the River Osugu overflooding its embankment and destroyed many houses, including a part of the correctional centre.
