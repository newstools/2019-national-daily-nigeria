The mystery behind the death of a pastor in Ondo state will linger for a while except the exchange between a dying 78-year-old church member and his 42-year-old pastor comes to the open.
Until then, everything remains puzzling as Pastor Femi Olorunsoromidayo slumped and died, and the very ambulance he used to bring the corpse of his late member to the cemetery at Erusu, Ondo, carried his own corpse back to Akure where he pastored the Mount Zon Gospel Church.
According to church members, the late Samuel, while dying, had an agreement with his pastor Femi to not carry his corpse to his home town Erusu.  The old man wanted to be bury at his home in Akure.
Femi agreed, only to cave in later when the late Samuel’s relatives mounted pressure on the pastor to bring the remains home for burial.
“Since the late pastor including his immediate family had limited authority over the burial plan, he arranged for an ambulance, which took the corpse to Erusu Akoko, alongside his family members and some church members,” a source revealed.
Things, however, turned deathly during the interment at the cemetery.
While Femi was conducting the burial service, he started feeling uncomfortable. Then he became unconscious.  He was later rushed to an undisclosed hospital in Akoko area where he was confirmed dead, the source said,
It was the ambulance which brought Elder Samuel corpse from Akure to the cemetery that took back the pastor’s.
Members, relatives, neighbours are wallowing in confusion now.
