The senior Pastor of the Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Gospel Church, Adewale Giwa has called on citizens to beg God to send someone who is capable to restructure the nation for proper functioning in the next general elections.
Giwa, in a statement on Wednesday in reaction to Supreme Court’s ruling that dismissed Abubakar Atiku’s petition against Muhammadu Buhari, said it would be difficult for Nigeria to progress if the present and future politicians continue to build on the political legacies left behind by the previous leaders.
“It is going to be tough for us to grow as a nation if the present politicians still deem it necessary to follow the paths of their predecessors by allowing history to repeat itself.
“The judiciary and other arms of government were under the control of former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, and the system remains stable and solid under this present administration.
“Nothing that is happening now that has not happened before, but this government has come to introduce modern ideas to it. It’s a shame that once a political party takes over the government, it takes over all the systems in the country, from the judiciary to the police and others.
“We must change our thinking, reasoning, ideas, and policies for the sake of present and future generations,” said Giwa.
