Recall that it was earlier reported that a lady (Helen) claimed that her sister (Susan) is pregnant for Nigerian pop singer, David Adeleke, better known as Davido.

Davido later reacted and vowed that the ladies in the viral video claiming one of them is pregnant for him would end up in prison.

The singer also offered to give N1million Naira to anyone that could identify the ladies.

The two ladies later shared a new video saying that it was a joke.

But the matter already turns ugly as Davido isnâ€™t wiling to take it lightly.

Davido says he is suing them.
