As public heat intensifies on the request to probe the presence of bullion van on the premises of APC leader Bola Tinubu’s Bourdillion home in Lagos on the eve of the Feb 23 election, the ruling party has picked its words in defence of the party’s biggest tactician.
According to the tacit acceptance of that fact by the state chapter of the party, the bullion vans were parked as the internet warriors who started the trend alleged. But then it wondered how that bugged anybody.
It was his money. It was for his party. It was for candidates contesting the presidential and NASS elections.
“If he has decided to spend his money on his party, how is that a problem? Let them come up with a proof that somebody’s money is missing,” said Lagos APC Spokesperson Abiodun Salami.
“Let them come up with the proof. The man is a private citizen and he has been out of government for the past 12 years.”
Among ‘them’ –those tearing their hair out—is the Abuja-based rabble-rouser and convener of  the Concerned Nigerians Dele Adeyanju who petitioned the EFCC last Friday. The commission said it had got no petition to dig into the bullion van saga.
“The commission would recall that it was reported all over the news that Bullion Vans allegedly containing an undisclosed amount of cash were seen entering the home of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State on the eve of Nigeria’s presidential elections,” he stated in the petition.
“What are Bullion Vans doing in the house of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu?”
Adeyanju warned the commission not to wage its anti-corruption war against the opposition only.
