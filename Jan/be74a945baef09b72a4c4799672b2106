Clarice Alves, the wife of Real Madrid soccer player Marcelo, has given an interview to La Otra Crónica during her attendance at the premiere of the movie “Familia en instante”. Clarice Alves confesses in the interview that Cristiano’s departure has “left a big gap”. “We’ve felt it because we get along a lot with his family. I also know her mother very much and Georgina is charming. Also, my son is very close to Junior, Cristiano’s son. Then, it has left us a big void, “said Alves.
In addition, Alves has admitted that he is affected by the criticism that Marcelo receives as a footballer. “Of course it bothers that they talk about someone who is giving everything, as is Marcelo. What will I tell you about him as a professional? He is the first to train … He has twelve wonderful career years. When someone says something negative, it annoys. ” During this interview, Alves has also assured that he does not care about being labeled as WAG and has also revealed the WAGs of Real Madrid with which he is more united. “I have very good friends. Vanjia, the wife of Luka Modric, is my great friend here. Also Andrea, from Keylor. I get along with all of them. I’ve been here for twelve years … I know them all, “said the actress and Marcelo’s wife.
