Multiple Italian reports suggest Juventus are very close to a deal for Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsey, who could even arrive this month.
The midfielder is out of contract on June 30, so is free to negotiate with non-English clubs from this month.
The Bianconeri confirmed this week that they’re monitoring the situation, and all three of the main Italian sports newspapers are confident a deal is close.
Gazzetta dello Sport believes there is a contract on the table worth €6.5m per season, with another €500,000 if he plays over 50 per cent of games in a season.
There’s a further €500,000 for playing over 70 per cent. In recent years Ramsey has always played over 30 games, but never managed more than 40.
The Welsh international can join for free in July, but the Corriere dello Sport believes Juve want to bring him earlier.
Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are also interested, so it makes sense to get a deal done as soon as possible.
Ramsey would be willing to move to Turin in January, and the Serie A leaders would offer around €5m to Arsenal to get the deal done right away.
