Just when we thought the ongoing scandal between Olakunle Churchill and his estranged wife and, Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh is over, another controversial news about them just popped up.

Tonto Dikeh vehemently rejected a prayer offered by a fan for her to reconcile with her ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill
