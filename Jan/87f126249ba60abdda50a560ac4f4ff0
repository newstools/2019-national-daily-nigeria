Murillo, 26, arrives in Barcelona in the winter market, ceded by Valencia until the end of the season, with the aim of reinforcing the central part of the Barça defense after the injuries of Vermaelen and Umtiti.
According to Xavi, Barcelona “is a favorite to win any competition, in the league has been five points from Atletico, seven from Sevilla and ten from Real Madrid, and has the competition on track, although there is still a lot, twenty games.”
“We are going to see how the second round takes place, the team is favorite to win the League and any competition,” the Terrasa midfielder insisted in statements to Efe.

With “the generation of Messi, Suárez, Piqué, Busquets, Jordi Alba and all the old guard”, Xavi considered that Barça leaves as “very favorite” to take that trophy.
Xavi participated this Wednesday in an event organized by ‘Generation Amazing’, a Qatar initiative that promotes social development through football in countries such as Nepal, Jordan, India or Pakistan.
