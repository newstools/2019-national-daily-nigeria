Ederson got so bored in net, he went in midfield for a moment but Pep Guardiola wasn’t happy with his keeper.
In the 86th minute, Ederson rushed out of his goal to intercept Adama Traore. He then carried on his venture by tackling Morgan Gibbs-White.
He ended up in midfield, and completed three passes.
The Brazilian keeper clearly wanted some action after literally doing nothing between the sticks.
Though Pep Guardiola’s reaction says it all. He looked furious on the touchline and didn’t seem too pleased in his post-match interview.
Ederson joining City’s midfield for a moment got people talking on social media.
City secured all-three points in an easy victory. Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring and he then doubled his sides lead from the spot.
The visitors were also reduced to 10-men after Willy Boly received a straight red card for a reckless tackle on Bernardo Silva.
City got a third in the second-half thanks to an own-goal from Conor Coady.
Pep’s charges are now four points off league leaders Liverpool.
