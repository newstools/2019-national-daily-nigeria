Presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar on Tuesday said President Muhammadu Buhari’s chickens have come home to roost following his decision to push people ahead to campaign for him.

Atiku made the statement while reacting to the announcement by President Buhari that he has handed over his campaign activities to the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu.

According to the former vice-president, he hope President Buhari will not Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to represent him in the presidential debate. “He is pushing people ahead to campaign for him because his chickens have come home to roost. It proves what we’ve been trying to say before that Buhari doesn’t have the energy and rigour to campaign.

“If he is giving someone else the task of leading his campaign, he could have as well given his presidential ticket to someone who has the energy. He should not use this as an excuse to be absent from the presidential debate.

“Nigerians want someone they can question and someone who is willing to listen to them. So, he (Buhari) should take charge of his own campaign.”

The statement added that “His excuse that he doesn’t want governance to suffer is not tenable.

“In the United States, United Kingdom, France and other great countries, campaign is part of governance because it is an avenue to interact with your people.

“Hence, Buhari should not hand over his campaign to someone else.

“In the first place, if he had organised the system to be running smoothly, he would not have given this excuse,” he added.
