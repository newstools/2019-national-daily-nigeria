Inter have reportedly told Coach Luciano Spalletti to win a trophy this season or face losing his job.
Spalletti met Inter’s board for a meal on Monday evening, and Gazzetta dello Sport claims there was more than the transfer market on the agenda.
The newspaper writes President Steven Zhang ‘made it clear’ he wanted the Nerazzurri to lift a trophy, with particular emphasis on the Coppa Italia, describing victory over Lazio on Thursday as ‘compulsory’.
Furthermore, former Juventus boss Antonio Conte would be in ‘pole position’ to replace the Beneamata boss this summer, while Jose Mourinho is also ‘above’ the other contenders.
Spalletti only extended his contract until 2021 at the start of the season, but the pinksheet warns ‘this is not a guarantee’ for the ex-Roma Coach to be kept on.
