The major victim of the Tuesday APC rally in Lagos is not getting better in the Eko Hospital, and may have to seek medical help abroad.
Musiliu Akinsaya, aka MC Oluomo, leader of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, was stabbed in the neck and belly with a poisoned knife by a rival who came as a party member to the campaign ground at Ikeja.
A close aide of the union leader, who spoke to The Punch on Thursday, said plans had been concluded for Oluomo’s treatment by a specialist in the United States.
The unionist is a US citizen.
Hospital sources said politicians have been trooping in to visit Oluomo in the hospital where truckloads of police officers guard him.
“A total 16 suspects have now been arrested in connection with the clash,” said the spokesman for the Lagos State Police Command, Chike Oti.
