A baby thought to be just a few hours old was in the early hours of today abandoned at the gate of a Catholic Church in Uromi area of Benin, Edo state.

The baby, National Daily gathered, was found with blood all over his body and his placenta by his side suggesting that he might have been born few hours before he was found.

Narrating how the baby was discovered to National Daily in a telephone conversation, Fr. Johnbosco Ezehi who also runs an orphanage home in the area said the baby was discovered by the gate-man with blood all over his body, adding that the fugitive mother did not leave any note or clue on why she abandoned him

“At about 5:05am as we were at adoration my gateman ran inside the church to meet me with the news of the cry of a brand new baby dumped at our gate. I ran out to behold a little “angel” crying in the cold uncovered but in a plastic bowl.

“I brought the baby inside the church briefly to call the women around and we headed straight to our hospital. And the doctor and nurse on duty were on ground and promptly took charge while we came back to church.

He said immediately after the mass, he in company of other members of the church immediately went back to check and noticed that the baby had been cleaned up and clothed.

He disclosed that the baby is in a stable condition, tested and certified okay. “We returned from hospital few hours ago, but we will still go for further test to determine other necessary things.”

According to Fr. Jonhbosco, with the help from church members and other well-meaning Nigerians, the baby will survive. “Judging from past experiences, I know that by God’s grace, she will make it. So please pray for her survival,” he added.
