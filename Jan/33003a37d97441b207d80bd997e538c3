A former militant leader in the Niger Delta, Asari Dokubo has advised the Minister of Transportation and Director General of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, Rotimi Amaechi to resign or be disgraced following the leaked of a controversial audio last week.

Recall that in the audio, Amaechi was alleged to have criticized the Buhari administration for inflicting untold hardship on the people.

Reacting to the audio in a video made available to National Daily, Asari Dokubo said he has listen to the audio, and could made bold to say that the voice belong to Amaechi, and nobody should try and deny that.

“My brother, this government will not cease to amaze us. When I listened to leaked audio, I discovered they were try to lie. They are resident of hell fire. That voice was that of Amaechi. There is no need to lie.”

“It’s Amaechi that is talking, and I know Amaechi can say it. Nobody should try and defend Amaechi because I know the voice is his,” he said.

According to him, the cabal in the Presidency have marked him down and just waiting for the election to be over before they strike. “It is better for you to leave now than to wait till the end, because then you will cry and those defending you now will be laughing.”

“Amaechi is my brother, this people don’t forgive. What they are doing to Dino Melaye will be a child play when they pounce on you. I’m warning you, it is better you find your level now.”

“It is better for you to leave now than to wait till the end, because then you will cry and those defending you now will be laughing. I know them, I know this people in and out. I beg you in the name of god. Leave when you still have time,” Asari Dokubo warned in the video.
