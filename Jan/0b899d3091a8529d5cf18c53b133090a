Coach of erstwhile Nigeria Professional Football League,  NPFL champions, Plateau United, Abdu Maikaba has declared that his target this year was to win the 2018/19 NPFL league.
Coach Maikaba who disclosed this in an interview  after his team played out a 1-1 draw with another premier league side,  Nasarawa United in Abuja on Wednesday, added that although he needed time with the team, he was comfortable  with the crop of players at his disposal.
“Our target is to win the league. We don’t have any other target other than that because if you go back to my past four seasons, I have tried to climb the ladder. I finished 4th with Wikki Tourist in my first season and 3rd in the second season. I finished 4th in my first year with Akwa United and finished 2nd in my second season with them. So my ultimate target is to be the champion.
“I am very comfortable with the players I have. What I need is time for them to get together and know themselves very well. I believe the team will go places,” he said.
He described the match as good preparatory exercise for both teams ahead of the league opener on Sunday.
“The match was a very good one and will help the two teams not in a small measure to start the 2018/19 NPFL season on Sunday. It was a good test for us and I believe it will help us in our Sunday opening league even though we have used different sets of players.
“On Tuesday we played against Kwara United and we used another group. We will try to pick our best team after the camping in Abuja as we start the league on Sunday.
“You know it is a new philosophy, a new coach and some new players. We need time to work together and form a nucleus. We did not have the opportunity to participate in any preseason tournament but we are pushing ourselves to be ready by Sunday for the kickoff of the league.
Plateau United will kickoff the 2018/19 NPFL season with a match against FC Ifeanyi Uba on
