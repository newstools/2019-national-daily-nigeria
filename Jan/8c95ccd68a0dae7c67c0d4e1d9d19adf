Kada city chief executive officer, Mr Ekene Abubakar Adams has urged the organizers of the league to call for an emergency meeting to address the issue of officiation in the Nigeria Professional Football League.

He made the submission after the match officials were put under intense pressure following Kada city 0-1 loss to Abia Warriors in the match day 4 encounter decided in Umuahia.

“The officiating was fair in the first half but the referee succumbed to pressure from the home fans in the second half by making some questionable calls which led to the controversial penalty awarded to the home team despite the player being in an offside position.

” We cannot continue this way because it’s frustrating and taking its toll on private clubs like myself. We traveled for about twelve hours on the road only to loss on 83rd minute questionable penalty.

We’re not encouraging violence at match venues,but our referees must be on top of their games because a lot of people are betting and we cannot afford to have more referees been molested at match venues. My boys did  well but could not attack in the second half because the referee pegged us in our half and gave a late penalty to save her life from threats from the home fans.

“Again, the league organizers and NRA should call the referees to order so that the best side can always win  instead of the must win at home syndrome”, he concluded.
