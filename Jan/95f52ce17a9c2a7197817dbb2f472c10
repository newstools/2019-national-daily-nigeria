Former Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State, responding to former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s press statement on Sunday, said both the former President and incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari are expired leaders that Nigerians should do away with. He was of the view that they don’t know when they have outlived their usefulness. The former governor described Obasanjo as the accuser and Buhari as the accused in the fireworks exercise preparatory to the 2019 general elections.
The former Ekiti State Governor on his twitter account declared: “Obasanjo (the accuser), and Buhari (the accused) are both expired that Nigerians are desirous of getting rid of. They both don’t know when they were born and have outlived their usefulness in the political life of Nigeria.”
Fayose, however, expressed support for Obasanjo’s statement, arguing that the statement did not exonerate Obasanjo from installing Buahri, who he said, that Nigerians have decided that he has failed and are the ones that will send the president to go in 2019, not the Obasanjo statement.
“Content of Obasanjo letter is a welcome development but the message is also culpable in the enthronement and colossal failure of Buhari. Though we warned them ahead of this tragedy. It is, therefore, the decision of Nigerians that Buhari has failed and he must go, not that of Obasanjo.”
“I agree with Obasanjo’s letter even though he didn’t say anything that I have not said about Buhari and his government before. However, Obasanjo and Buhari are like accuser and the accused; two of them are analog and they do not represent the Nigeria of today.”
