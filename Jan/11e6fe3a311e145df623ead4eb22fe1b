The Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Walter Onnoghen, has debunked media reports that he has resigned as a result of his prosecution over asset declaration by the federal government through the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). Social media has been replete with reports of the CJN resignation.

However, the CJN, Justice Onnoghen, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on media, Awassam Bassey, said that there is no truth in the report of his resignation, adding that he has been performing his duties and will be performing a national duty on Saturday in inaugurating the governorship election petition tribunals.

The statement declared: “There is absolutely no truth in the rumours making the round that the Hon. Chief Justice of Nigeria, His Lordship Hon. Mr. Justice Walter Samuel Nkanu Onnoghen, GCON, has resigned his office. It is fake news! The Hon CJN was in the office all through yesterday (Thursday) and sat in court. As part of his duties, the Hon CJN will be swearing in members of the 2019 National Assembly, Governorship & State Assembly Election Petition Tribunals tomorrow (Saturday 26th January 2019).”
