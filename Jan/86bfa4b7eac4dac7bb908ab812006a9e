Jose Mourinho has claimed that he has already turned down three job offers from unspecified clubs since moving on from Manchester United,National Daily learnt.
The Portuguese manager was relieved of his duties at Old Trafford after two and a half years in charge last month.
Adverse Premier League results and a deteriorating dressing room atmosphere both contributed to his sacking, while results have improved noticeably at United under interim successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
But he insists that his lack of regular employment on the bench – he is currently working as a television pundit – is not for want of offers.
“First of all I’m happy with these three weeks,” the former Real Madrid and Inter boss said to, for whom he is commenting on the Asian Cup.
“I’m happy with this experience. I’m going to have other experiences that normally I cannot have.
“But I know me and I know that by the end of March I am struggling a little bit with my happiness.
“I know my nature. My next move? I don’t know. It depends.
“I will analyse things. I don’t like to speak about it, but I have refused already three options.”
