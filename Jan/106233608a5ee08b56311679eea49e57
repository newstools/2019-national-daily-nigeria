The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore, and his running mate, Dr. Rabiu Ahmed Rufai, appeared in court on Tuesday for the hearing of the suit against the Nigerian Elections Debate Group (NEDG) and the Broadcasting Organizations of Nigeria (BON) over the exclusion of the AAC from the 2019 presidential debate.
National Daily learnt from the party’s statement on Tuesday that after an intense day consisting two court sessions where the defendants tried every trick in the book to delay and postpone the case, the judge finally ruled for the case to be postponed to settle some legal technicalities. The case will be assigned to a different judge and the new date will be announced shortly after full legal procedures have been met.
The AAC has always demanded to know why the party’s candidates were excluded from this debate. The party argued that it is inconceivable that a debate stage will hold five presidential candidates and the most persuasive voice of the nation, the AAC is not included.
AAC noted that several phone calls to Eddie Emesiri, the executive secretary of the NEDG did not yielded a conclusive response; adding that he rather chose to hurl insults and allegations at the party and its founder.
“We have never thought the road to freedom would be easy,” AAC rmarked.
The party declared: “we are well aware that those who have gained from the rot and decay of Nigeria would not take lightly to our demands for freedom. But the revolution has begun and Nigeria MUST progress. We will see the NEDG/BON in court,”
