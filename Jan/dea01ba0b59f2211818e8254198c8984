Aaron Ramsey was integral to Arsenal’s impressive win over Chelsea this weekend, but Unai Emery thinks the time to regret his exit has passed.
Playing in a midfield diamond, Ramsey posed Chelsea problems all game with his tireless running and energy.
Arsenal fans are disappointed to see the Welshman leave, particularly as the Gunners withdrew their new contract offer.
Emery said: “We spoke about the circumstance with Ramsey three months ago and now the decision is finished for him and for the club.
“Yes, of course, his future is very important for his family but it is also very important for him to be OK to play for us like he did against Chelsea.
“I am very happy with him because in the last month his focus has been very clear.
“Two weeks ago when we travelled to Blackpool where the atmosphere was difficult and the pitch was not good, he said to me ‘I want to play and help this team’.
“That is the spirit I want to see and I didn’t need to ask him because I knew he wanted to play against Chelsea and he helped us with his quality.”
