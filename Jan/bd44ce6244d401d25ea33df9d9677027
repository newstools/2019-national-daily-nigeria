The desperation of the political parties in the general elections is being taken to the altitude by the respective political parties taking advantages of the opportunities available to them. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has been taking maximum advantage of the incumbency powers at its behest in the control of the federal government.
Beyond the controversies over appointment of certain persons suspected to have relations with the President and perceived APC members into the INEC, there are emerging revelations that APC governorship candidates in the various states were given the privilege to appoint a\d hoc staff for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) who would be deployed to the various polling units during the general elections in February and March.
Moreover, the ad hoc staff are further trained by INEC officials suspected to have links with the ruling APC. Thus, the transparency and credibility of the general elections arte in question because the ad hoc staff supervises the polling process and could do anything for their employers or party leaders.
Meanwhile, the PDP has challenged the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, to endeavor to extricate the Commission from partisanship in supervising the general elections.
Though, INEC has at different times assured of conducting transparent elections, the controversies and insinuations the commission   refused to clear like the controversial appointment of Amina Zakari, continue to raise suspicions. There could be need to review the appointment of ad hoc staff for the elections, including the returning officers to clear them of the APC colourations.
