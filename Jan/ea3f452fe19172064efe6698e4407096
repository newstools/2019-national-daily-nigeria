Opposition political parties on the platform of the Coalition of United Political Parties on Tuesday cut a cake to celebrate the retirement of the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris.
The coalition’s spokesman, Imo Ugochinyere, told journalists in Abuja that the cutting of the cake was meant to symbolise the end of Idris’ “era of shame and inglorious past.”
Ugochinyere said a portion would be sent to Idris and President Muhammadu Buhari.
He thereafter set agenda for whoever succeeds the IG.
The agenda included the call for the release of all political detainees including Dino Melaye and Deji Adeyanju.
