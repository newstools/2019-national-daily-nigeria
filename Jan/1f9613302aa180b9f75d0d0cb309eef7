Senate President Bukola Saraki has again thrown a jibe at the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

While on a courtesy visit to Oba Mufutau Gbadamosi, the Olofa of Offa at his palace on Sunday, Saraki said APC leaders in Kwara can’t access President Muhammadu Buhari for anything unless they go through Lagos, a reference to Tinubu.

“They will first have to go and submit their request to Lagos and it is only when Lagos is satisfied with the request that it will be forwarded to Buhari who may or not do it.”

The senate president said but for God and the support of the people “I will not be standing today.”

“Since we joined the PDP the party has honored Kwara state, they gave us DG of Campaign, National Leader of the party and have agreed that if the party wins, senate president is our slot in Kwara,” he said.

“But what has the other party to offer? If I have skeleton in my cupboard, this government would have silenced me and forced me to drop the campaign.

“But for God and the support of the people I would not be standing today. They didn’t want to honor our agreement. We all laboured and what they couldn’t get in three times they got it and we demanded that they give to Kwara what we deserve.

“We need to teach our seasonal politicians a lesson on the poll date. We want community development, let everybody come and contribute their quota to our communities; when Saraki do his own, let them too do their own. I heard that some politicians have been buying JAMB forms in 2019. The question to ask is where were they in 2016, where were they in 2017?
