The second term ambition of President Muhammadu Buhari has torn the household of one Abdullahi Yada’u, a resident of Kanam local government area of Plateau state, apart.

Speaking on a BBC Hausa Service on Thursday, Yada’u said he decided to divorce his wife of many years, Hafsat Suleiman, after failing to convince her not to vote for President Muhammadu Buhari in next month’s election.

He said both of them supported Buhari in the 2015 elections but this time, he felt disappointed with the administration and decided not to vote for him again.

“I told her that she must not vote for him but she insisted which led to a quarrel which attracted the attention of our neighbours, I slapped her and told her to choose between voting for Buhari and staying with me. She ran away,” Yada’u said.

“Later her parents called me and I narrated to them what transpired between us. But still my wife insisted on voting for Buhari, that’s how I divorced her in the presence of her parents.”

Ibrahim Suleiman, the wife’s elder brother, said: “We decided to deal with him (Yada’u) but our father stopped us from joining issues with him.

“He really disgraced us. They have been having issues even in the previous election.

“She is the one that convinced him to vote for Buhari, now he insisted on voting for Mr Atiku Abubakar. We decided that we will not allow her to go back to him again.”
