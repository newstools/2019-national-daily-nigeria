David De Gea is waiting on a new £300,000-a-week offer from Manchester United before pledging his long-term future to the club, National Daily understands
The 28-year-old’s current deal is due to expire at the end of next season after United triggered a 12-month extension clause earlier this year.
De Gea has been linked with moves to Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid in the past but his preference is to remain at United.
The Spain international was unwilling to sign a new deal with United during Jose Mourinho’s time at Old Trafford amid concerns about the club’s ability to challenge for silverware.
However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has won his first six matches in charge and already lifted the gloom that surrounded Mourinho’s tenure.
De Gea currently earns £200,000-a-week but is United’s best player and arguably the best goalkeeper in the world, underlined by his performance in Sunday’s 1-0 wins over Tottenham.
De Gea is keen to prolong his stay at United but believes he should be one of the best-paid players at the club and is holding out for £300,000-a-week before jotting on the dotted line.
The Spaniard made 11 saves in United’s victory over Tottenham, a record in a Premier League match this season. Furthermore, only Neil Etheridge (81) has made more saves than De Gea (80) in the Premier League this season.
