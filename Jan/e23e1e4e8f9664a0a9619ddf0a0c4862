Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode on Wednesday backtracked on his allegation that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was planning to arrest Walter Onnoghen, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN).

Recall that the outspoken politician had Tuesday alleged that operatives of the anti-graft agency had surrounded the home of Onnoghen with the intention to arrest him.

Fani-Kayode had written: “Why have the EFCC surrounded the home of CJN Onnoghen and why are they seeking to arrest him? These people want Nigeria to burn! Buhari call off your dogs before it is too late! This is a democracy and not a gestapo state! In the name of God let this madness stop.”

He asked the federal government to “tell us which agency sent those men and why they beat a retreat”.

But the EFFC in a statement signed by its head of media and publicity, Tony Orilade on Tuesday denied the allegations, threatening to sue Fani-Kayode and Yinka Odumakin for the fake news.

“We also want to assure Fani-Kayode, Yinka Odumakin and other purveyors of the evil news to be ready to defend their actions in the court of law as the EFCC will file libel suit against them without further delay,” the statement reads.

Reacting to the development in a statement on Wednesday, Fani-Kayode expressed regret over the information he shared.

The ex-minister said he has deleted the post from social media. He said: “Yesterday I was informed by usually reliable sources that EFCC were positioned outside CJN’s home.

“I have since discovered that the men were not from EFCC and I removed the posting. The error is regretted.”
