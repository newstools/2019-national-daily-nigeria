President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub as new Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives). The President made the appointment after the resignation of Hon. Kawu Sumaila.
Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, in a statement in Abuja, declared: “Hon. Sumaila, appointed SSA in August 2015, resigned to contest for membership of the House of Representatives representing Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency in Kano State under the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
“His successor, El-Yakub, an APC stalwart from Kano State, was a member of the House of Representatives, 1998 and 2003-2007 representing Kano Municipal Federal Constituency.”
