Lionel Messi paid tribute to team-mates past and present after reaching 400 La Liga goals for Barcelona in Sunday’s 3-0 win over Eibar,National Daily learnt.
The 31-year-old is the league’s all-time top goalscorer by some distance, having surpassed the previous record of 251 – held for 59 years by Athletic Bilbao great Telmo Zarra – in November 2014.
His latest landmark goal doubled Barca’s lead over Eibar at Camp Nou, producing a typically clinical finish with his left foot in the 53rd minute.
The Argentina international is now 89 goals ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, who left for Juventus in July, and the only other active La Liga players in the division’s top 30 all-time leading scorers are Aritz Aduriz and Karim Benzema.
With 17 already, Messi is well on track to score 25 or more in the top flight for the 10th season running, and he was filled with pride to have reached another remarkable milestone.
“I’m proud to have reached 400 goals and I hope I can get some more,” he told Mundo Deportivo.
