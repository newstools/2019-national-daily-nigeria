Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has revealed that his boss was aware of the trial of Chief Justice of Nigeria Walter Onnoghen at the Code of Conduct Tribunal only on Saturday evening.
“I can tell you for a fact that he did not even know about this (CJN trial) until Saturday evening. I don’t feel good about it that senior members of my profession are being tried.”
He, however, stated that President Muhammadu Buhari has always insisted institutions must be allowed to do their jobs without any interference.
“Sometimes, it has consequences such as we have today, such that people say, ‘How can such an important person be subjected to trial without the Federal Government?” he added.
“But I can tell you without any equivocation that he (Buhari) was not aware.”
He also expressed sadness over the trial of the National President of Nigerian Bar Association, Paul Usoro (SAN).
Onnoghen was to begin his trial Monday for  non-declaration of assets.
Osinbajo said this in Abuja on Wednesday during a one-day conference organised by Online Publishers Association of Nigeria, with the theme: “Free Press and objective reporting in the 2019 election year.”
The V.P said he was not pleased that senior members of his profession are subject to such treatment.
Apart from Onnoghem, the Nigerian Bar Association Presdent Paul Usoro is alos being prosecuted by the EFCC.
The federal government has, meanwhile, ordered the discontinuation of Onnoghen’s arraignment.
