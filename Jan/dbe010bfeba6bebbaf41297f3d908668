The Bus Conductors Association of Nigeria (BCAN) says it’s mobilising more than six million votes for President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 16 presidential election.
The national President of the association made the promise on Tuesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos.
“We have mobilised all our members nationwide and other artisans in affiliation with the Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO) toward the elections,” said Israel Adesola.
“We are promising President Buhari of our votes with other artisans affiliated to BCAN, numbering over six million members nationwide,” he said.
The BCAN president also urged the electorate to shun vote selling so as to ensure better tomorrow for the coming generations.


“I urge the electorate not to sell their votes unless you do not want better tomorrow for your children.


“We must beware of gifts because behind the facade of that gift lies monstrous and devious plan to mortgage your future and that of the coming generations,” he said.
Mr Adeshola advised members of the association to protect their Permanent Voter Cards to return Mr President to office.
