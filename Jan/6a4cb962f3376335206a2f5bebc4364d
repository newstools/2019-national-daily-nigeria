Olusegun Banjo, Lagos state commissioner for budget and economic planning, says the state’s 2019 budget has been submitted to the state house of assembly.

In a statement released on Thursday, Banjo said the budget proposal was N852.317billion.

This is the first time in 10 years that the state government would present the budget after the fiscal year ended.

Banjo said in a statement on Wednesday that the budget was to have been read before the house on December 24, 2018.

The commissioner said Akinwumi Ambode, the state governor, had sent verbal information to present the budget on December 24, after the state executive council approval on December 19.

According to him, the presentation did not take place as the house is on recess and could not form a quorum.

He said in order to meet the traditional presentation, a formal letter with the proposed budget attached, was sent to the house on December 28.

“It is expected that when the House reconvenes, the Speaker will inform members of the content of the budget proposal sent by the governor and take necessary action,” he said.

Earlier, the governorship candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party in Lagos State, Jimi Agbaje, had criticised Gov. Ambode for the delay in the presentation of the 2019 budget.
