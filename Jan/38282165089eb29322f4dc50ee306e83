The invasion of Gaidam, Yobe State, by Boko Haram insurgents has thrown the community and its environs into pandemonium, leading to the death of two persons and unknown number of persons kidnapped.
It was gathered that the terrorists invaded the Town in utility vehicles at about 5:30pm on Wednesday, which was the market day, and started shooting sporadically.
They burnt down some houses and looted foodstuffs.
A vigilante source gathered that residents and troops were aware of the impending attack because the insurgents had sent a letter of warning.
The vigilante had narrated: “As you know, yesterday was our market day in Gaidam, so, they took advantage and came in large convoys and started shooting. There was confusion in the whole town. They overpowered the troops and the soldiers eventually fled. We lost two persons and several others were injured. Some persons were also abducted.”
