Troops of the Nigerian military recovered Rann Town in the North East from the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) after hours of hot exchange of bullets.
Forces of the Nigerian military and residents of Rann were said to have fled the town as the ISWA militants attacked the community and set houses ablaze. The Nigerian troops, after the retreat, launched a counter-attack and recaptured Rann in the early hours of Tuesday with combined forces including the military and the Police.
A source was said to have revealed that the military launched a counter-offensive and retook the town, after the troop had given ISWA a “bloody nose”.
A source was gathered to have revealed that ISWA had invaded Rann at about 4.00pm on Monday, forcing the Nigerian troops to retreat while indigenes flee the community. The Nigerian troops them launched a counter attack in a battle said to have lasted about three hours before the terrorists were subdued and Rann town recaptured.
ISWA, splitting from Boko Haram in 2016, has been waging deadly wars in the North.
In December, ISWA was reported to have captured Baga in Borno State, though the military denied it. However, multinational troops which included of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger Armed Forces fought the extremists and recaptured Baga. Over 30,000 indigenes were said to have fled the community during the fighting.
