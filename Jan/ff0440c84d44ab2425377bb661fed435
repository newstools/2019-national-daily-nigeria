Management of the University of Bénin (UNIBEN) as appealed to the Joint Admission Matriculation Board ( JAMB ) to lift the ban on the use of its ICT Computer Based Test (CBT) centre for the unified tertiary matriculation examination registration.
It denied allegation that it charged above N700 as cost of registration
A statement signed by the university spokesman, Mr. Micheal Osasuyi, said the suspension over alleged breach of the code governing the 2019 JAMB registration exercise was done hastily and without proper investigation.
Osasuyi explained that JAMB was solely in charge of vending of Pins and its CBT Centre charged the duly approved N700 only as cost of registration.
He noted that the suspension of UNIBEN CBT Centre would amount to denying the institution access code to clear the backlog of over 300 candidates.
Osasuyi appealed to JAMB to restore access to the University Portal to enable candidates process their registration without delay and commended JAMB for swiftly putting up measures to check extortion of candidates in the registration exercise.
According to him, “Since we are not vending pins, JAMB has the authority over pins vending and can track the source of each pin they have dispensed.
“It is not proper for JAMB to withdraw our access without proper investigation of the accusation. For clarification, University of Benin is not vending JAMB PINs. We only attend to candidates who have their pins and they pay only N700.”Osasuyi said.
“We have partnered with JAMB over the years without blemish, this accusation is, therefore, a serious embarrassment to the University of Benin. We look forward to your prompt release of our access code to be able to clear the backlog of over 300 candidates as a result of the withdrawal of our access.” Osasuyi said.
