The APC campaign rally in Jos turned out to be so overwhelming President Muhammadu Buhari had to be led through the back door out of the venue.
The president to left without giving a speech–he could only waved at the rowdy supporters.
After arriving the Rwang Pam stadium, it took the president almost 30 minutes to reach his seat as security operatives laboured to control the crowd.
The crowd surged toward the podium while some climbed the top of vehicles in the entourage.
Governor Simon Lalong and the the director general of the Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign Organisation, Rotimi Amaechi, could not deliver their speeches either.
