This is certainly the era of impunity in Nigeria Football as the Taraba state FA chairman, Timothy Heilman whom it is claimed has hidden the election forms from other candidates is said to have continued to boast that even members of the Nigeria Football Football Federation in Abuja cannot force him to release the forms.
The FA chairman is claiming that attempt by the aggrieved parties to take their case to Abuja will not yield any positive result boasting that he has the full support of the NFF board members in Abuja,National Daily learnt.
The current FA Chairman whom many have accused to be running the FA operations from his personal office and have abandoned the official FA office at the stadium is said to have even claimed that he has very strong relationship with the NFF bigwigs stressing that none of them would entertain their petition from the aggrieved Taraba state football stake holders.
Our investigation reveal further that except the NFF leadership in Abuja wade into the issue and prevail on the FA Chairman to make the election forms available to other members the issue may degenerate into a dipper crisis in the state which may not speak well for Nigeria football.
Our source also stated that the aggrieved members have sworn that they would not allow any election to hold in the state if the process is not thrown open to all interested candidates.
“We are having this fear that this man is having some very strong backing from the NFF in Abuja. Because the way he is bragging that nobody will force him to bring out the form shows that somebody or some people are behind him, but we are waiting.
“This is not how things should be done and if this kind of thing is allowed to happen this way, the country football will continue to have crisis which does not speak well of our football,” one of the stake holders said in confidence.
