In what seems a counter-offensive against series of anti-APC leaks the PDP has been unleashing, the ruling party splashed a photograph of the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar sharing a kiss with a woman.
Kayode Ogundamis, a member of the Directorate of Media and Strategic Communication of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Team, posted the photo on Twitter.
And he added a note: “If it was President Muhammadu Buhari now, they (opposition) would have titled it, ‘Buhari caught on camera flirting with Adamawa PDP women leader.’
“But we won’t do that to you people! We know Atiku was just saying hello! #ElectionIsNotWar.
The photo has since gone viral.
But one Mustapha Abu Bakr, who describes himself as Atiku’s son has said that the woman receiving affection in the photo is his mother.
Replying Ogundamisi through the Twitter handle @HHMustaphaAA, Abu Bakr said, “This attitude is disgusting. Your animosity towards him is understood as a public official, but she is not. Please respect her as a woman and both of them as a couple.”
