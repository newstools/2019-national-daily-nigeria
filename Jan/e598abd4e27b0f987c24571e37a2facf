The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has denied some reports that it has arrested the Chief justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen during a raid on his residence.

In a statement signed by the commission’s acting head of media and publicity, Tony Orilade, the EFCC said the report was not only a figment of the imagination of the purveyor of the fake news, but also an evil machination by creator of the news to cause anarchy in the country.

 “For the record, the EFCC never went to the house of the CJN for arrest neither was invitation extended to him. Several calls and short messages received all point to the fact that the brains behind the fake news had one thing in mind: to act as agent of destabilization. We would not give in to their plots.”

Orilade in the statement said one of the architect of the fake news, Femi Fani-Kayode, was quoted as saying “Why have the EFCC surrounded the home of CJN Onnoghen and why are they seeking to arrest him? These people want Nigeria to burn! Buhari call off your dogs before it is too late! This is a democracy and not a gestapo state! In the name of God let this madness stop”. Another arrowhead of the fake news, Yinka Odumakin shared a non-existent video which has gone viral.

“We want to assure Nigerians that while we would fight corruption in line with the mandate setting up the Commission, agents of darkness, in the likes of Femi Fani-Kayode, Yinka Odumakin and his cohorts, would never be able to manipulate the people against the Commission.

“We also want to assure Fani-Kayode, Yinka Odumakin and other purveyors of the evil news to be ready to defend their actions in the court of law as the EFCC will file libel suit against them without further delay,” he added.
