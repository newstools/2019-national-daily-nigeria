 Federal high Court in Kano on Wednesday, January 16, voided the nomination of Shaaban Ibrahim Sharada, the nomination of the personal assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari (media), as All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Kano municipal federal constituency in the House of Representatives.
The court then went ahead to uphold Mutari Ishaq Yakasai, the former Kano municipal council chairman who is also member of the APC, as the rightful candidate.
Mutari emerged the winner of the 2018 primary election held in the state, yet Sharada’s name was forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the party’s flag bearer, a development which brought about Mutari suing Sharada, APC and INEC and demanding the court to validate his candidacy for the office.
In her judgement, Justice Saadatu Ibrahim, the presiding judge, upheld the APC result duly signed by the party during the primary election, where Mutari emerged winner.
Meanwhile, the Birnin-Kebbi magistrate court 4, has transferred the forgery and false impersonation suit filled against Abubakar Garlimallam, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate’s running mate, and three others to Kebbi state High court, saying it does not have jurisdiction to oversee the case.
Muhammed Ghali Abdullahi of magistrate court 4, Birnin-Kebbi, in his judgement said that the national electoral Act, 2010 does not give his court the jurisdiction to hear the suit against the accused persons. However, Abdullahi ruled that the case be transferred to the Federal High Court for hearing.
