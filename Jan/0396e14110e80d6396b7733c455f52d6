Senator Shehu Sani, representation Kaduna Central, Kaduna State, in the |National Assembly, last Friday, warned the President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, over his inclusion as a Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari in the All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council to thread with care to avoid spillover effect on his private business. Senator Sani cautioned Dangote not to mix his “cement” with the APC “broom”.
APC had announced the inauguration of the party’s 2019 Presidential Campaign Council on Friday.
The ruling APC had appointed Alhaji Dangote, owner of Dangote Cement, and Femi Otedola of the Forte Oil, into the Special Advisory Committee to President Buhari in the party’s Presidential Campaign Council.
Senator Sani, however, counseled Dangote against mixing his business with politics.

“Dear Bro Aliko, don’t use Broom to reinforce your silos, don’t use Broom as your plasterboard; don’t use Broom to mix your concrete, maintain the use of your machine concrete mixer,” Sani had tweeted on Friday.
The generated controversies across the country over the inclusion of Dangote and Otedola as Special Advisers  to President Buhari in the Council; however, the Presidency acknowledged that they were included in error.
