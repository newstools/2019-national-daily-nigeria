The National Professional Footballers’ Union (UNFP) of France has called on Paris Saint-Germain to end their exclusion of Adrien Rabiot, claiming that the club’s treatment is illegal and borders on “harassment”.
National Daily learnt that Rabiot caused a stir at the end of 2018 when he declined to discuss an extension on his PSG contract, which expires in June.
In response the club banished him to train with the reserves, amid reports that the midfielder would soon be signing terms with Barcelona.
Coach Thomas Tuchel reiterated this week that Rabiot would not be considered for match duties, even though an injury to Marco Verratti leaves PSG short of cover in midfield.
But according to the UNFP, the Ligue 1 leaders are acting improperly, as they lack the necessary facilities to allow a group of professional players to train apart from the first team as stipulated in local regulations.
“When there is no place to train, which is PSG’s case, the criteria do not apply, it just means another group cannot be formed,” the union’s legal director, Stephane Burchkalter, explained to Goal.
