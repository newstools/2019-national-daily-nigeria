Presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, says he will consider granting amnesty to corrupt persons willing to surrender their loot.

Featuring on The Candidate, a live television programme on 2019 elections on Wednesday, said the issue of corruption has been an impediment to the growth of the country, disclosing other means through which he intends to fight corruption.

According to him, granting amnesty to looter if they returned their loot is a model that has worked in Turkey and would work in Nigeria as well.

“Turkey gave an amnesty and all the money abroad came back. The government said that if you bring the money, there is not even taxation. We want you to invest in manufacturing, technology and real estate. Look at Turkey today. It’s like any other European countries in terms of development. They drew a line. Why not, we can consider it.

“I believe there will be need for dialogue between the various branches of government. We are at a crisis point in this country in the issue of fight against corruption. We can’t afford delay. Before we review our procedures and laws, I think there is need we do something immediately. Then, I believe everybody will understand if you really intend to fight corruption.

“There was a recovery panel set up by President Obasanjo under my chairmanship, the attorney general and the national security adviser. By calling various people who have been alleged to have stolen money, we recovered over $4 billion which we paid back into the treasury. If you are to prosecute these people, up till now, you will still be prosecuting them.”

Describing election rigging as a form of corruption that people do not pay attention to, he suggested that Election Fraud Commission be set up.
