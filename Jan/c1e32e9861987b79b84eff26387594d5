Luka Modric says he wants to extend his time with Real Madrid.

The Ballon d’Or winner is under contract through 2020 but told reporters that he would like to stay past the end of his current deal.

 “My desire is to stay here for more time,” he said. “I am as happy as I was on the first day.”

Could Alejandro Romero Gamarra, known simply as Kaku, be Club America’s replacement for Diego Lainez?

The Liga MX giant recently sold their talented young star to Real Betis, and ESPN Mexico is now claiming that New York Red Bulls star Kaku is being lined up as a replacement.

The 24-year-old netted six times and added 14 assists in his first season with New York.
