The Vice President of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, had on Wednesday said that President Muhammadu Buhari only knew about the arraignment of CJN Onnoghen at the CCT on Saturday. The vice president merely attempted to exonerate the president from the plot which many stakeholders lamented was to intimidate the judiciary towards the 2019 general elections. Professor Osinbajo pretended to persuade Nigerians and the international community that President Buhari has given full autonomy to public institutions in the country and does not interfere with the processes.
However, stakeholders in the polity including the Opposition PDP, CUPP and others have countered Osinbajo’s statement. The PDP had maintained that Buhari knew much more than his deputy was telling Nigerians.
The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), exposed to the public the communication from the AGF to NFIU on the freezing of CJN’s accounts. CUPP further raised the alarm over the safety of Onnoghen in the hands of the APC-led federal government; contesting the moves of the APC government to confiscate the CJN’s assets and freeze his bank accounts for allegedly refusing to compromise the composition of the post-general election appeal tribunals.
