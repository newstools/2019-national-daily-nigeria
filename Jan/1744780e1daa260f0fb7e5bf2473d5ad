Blessing Mary Ocheido who uses a wheelchair to move about due to her inability to use her both legs has called on the Access Bank to be more inclusive in the way they build their banking Halls. In a letter she described her pains and disappointment in failed attempted to go do business in the bank.

 This is her Open Letter:

 Dear Access Bank,

I use a wheelchair and needed to make use of your MoneyGram services sometime last week and upon visiting one of your facilities, the closest to my work place in Kubwa, Abuja, I realised that there were no accessibility ramps to enable me enter the building. Even your doors are too small to fit a wheelchair.

I asked your security personnel if there were other entrances into the bank that I could use instead and they replied that there were none. So I was left with the option of waiting under the sun while they went in to make inquiries on my behalf.

Upon his return, the security man said I would have to go into the bank to be attended to. And seeing as there was simply no way for me to do that, except maybe to be lifted up in his arms, I had to leave.

There are over 20 million people with disabilities in Nigeria, a good number of whom make use of wheelchairs. So you can imagine the large demographic of people to whom you’ve shut out of accessing your banking services. You would agree with me that this is not right.

I’m speaking out on behalf of people like me and kindly requesting that you build disability ramps in all your facilities and make your mantrap doors wheelchair-friendly.

Thanks in anticipation of your speedy response.
