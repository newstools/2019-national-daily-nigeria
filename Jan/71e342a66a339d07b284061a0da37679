as INEC rejects Ezekwesili’s withdrawal

The court of appeal in Abuja has declared Donald Duke, former governor of Cross River, as the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).

The appellate court set aside the judgement of an Abuja high court which declared Jerry Gana, former information minister, as the party’s presidential flagbearer.

Duke had challenged the decision of the lower court.

In its ruling on Thursday, the appeal court declared that Duke is the authentic presidential candidate of the party.

Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has rejected the decision of  Oby Ezekwesili to withdraw as the presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN).

Ezekwesili announced her withdrawal on Thursday, saying she wanted to give room for a coalition against candidates of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC).

But reacting via a statement, Rotimi Oyekanmi, chief press secretary to the INEC chairman, said November 17 was the last date for withdrawal.

The statement read: “It is impossible for any presidential candidate to withdraw from the race now. According to the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2019 General Elections, the last day for withdrawal by candidates or replacement of withdrawn candidates by political parties was 17th November, 2018 for Presidential and National Assembly Elections.

“The deadline for Ezekwesili or any candidate in that category to withdraw or be replaced has passed.”

Section 35 of the electoral act, which gives deadline from withdrawal from any election, states: “A candidate may withdraw his candidature by notice in writing signed by him and delivered by himself to the political party that nominated him for the election and the political party shall convey such withdrawal to the Commission not later than 45 days to the election.”
