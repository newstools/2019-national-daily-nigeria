Media aide to the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Tunde Rahman, has debunked claims by former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode that Tinubu slumped and has been in the hospital for three days.
 
Fani-Kayode had in a tweet Thursday afternoon claimed that Tinubu slumped soon after Buhari appointed him co-chairman of APC Presidential Campaign Council last Monday and has remained in hospital.
 
However, Tinubu, the co-chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council, attended the meeting of the council in Abuja on Thursday.
 
Reacting to the claim, Rahman said, “That was so reckless of Fani-Kayode. It’s so irresponsible. Go on Facebook and you will see Asiwaju’s pictures at the meeting with Buhari and others at the APC Presidential Campaign Council.”
 
APC national publicity secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, speaking about the meeting of the council had said that “the agenda for the meeting had to do with drawing the timetable and deciding on the messaging. It didn’t require everyone in the council to be present.
 
Meanwhile, there were concerns following the absence of APC governors at the meeting. But Issa-Onilu said that was not an issue because it was not mandatory for the state chief executives to attend the meeting which, according to him, was only meant to design a timetable and the central messages of the campaign.
