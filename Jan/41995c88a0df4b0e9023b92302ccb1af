“We’re delighted to be part of history with the Ikenne-Remo based team as our tourney helped prepare the team for the Super8 Playoff in Aba.
“Not too many teams secure promotion just a year after been relegated, but Remo Stars proved book makers wrong.”
In the Gold Cup Tourney in Akure last November, they showed the giant-killer stuff in them when they beat Rivers Utd in the Group stage only to lose to Sunshine Stars 3-2 on penalties in the semi-final.
“Now that they have secured promotion back to the NPFL, I hope they have learnt a big lesson in their debut season as the topflight division is not child’s play.
“I hope this time around they will get their act right as the 2018/19 abridged league season will be tougher than the ones we have ever experienced in the history of the NPFL.”
