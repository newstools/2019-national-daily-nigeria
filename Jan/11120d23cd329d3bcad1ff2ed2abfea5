Samuel Umtiti, winner of the Repsol Extraordinary Trophy along with his team colleague at FC Barcelona Ivan Rakitic after playing both the last final of the World Cup, held in Russia, picked up the prize at the Grand Gala MD. The French international center had time to explain to the whole audience how he is going to recover from his injury, which still keeps him away from the playing fields, without wanting to advance a date for his return despite the good intentions of the host of the Gala , Jordi Basté. “I feel good, now I’m focused on my recovery and I hope to return as soon as possible, but I do not know when. I do not know, “he said.
All in all, the most juicy part of Umtiti’s intervention was his definition of his compatriot and costume colleague at Barça and the French team Ousmane Dembélé. “Now he’s playing fucking (he apologizes for the expression). Is a crack. It will help us win the Champions League, the Cup and the League. “
