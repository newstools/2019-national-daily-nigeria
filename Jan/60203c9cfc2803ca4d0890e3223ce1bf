Liverpool head coach Jurgen Klopp has expressed his delight at working with Sadio Mane, having previously passed on the the opportunity to sign the attacker while still in charge of Borussia Dortmund.
 The German Bundesliga club were close signing the Senegal international from RB Salzburg in 2014, but Klopp failed to sanction the deal.
 Offered a ‘second chance’ to sign the forward two years later, Klopp snapped up the opportunity – luring Mane to Anfield from English Premier League rivals Southampton for a reported £34 million.
 The 26-year-old has turned out to be somewhat of a bargain and has formed arguable the most feared attacking partnership with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. Mane has scored 42 goals – assisting a further 20 – in 100 appearances across all competitions for the Merseyside club.
 “I have made a few mistakes in my life and one of my biggest mistakes ever was not taking Sadio when I was at Dortmund,” Klopp said, per Liverpool Echo.
 “We were together in an office and I spoke to him.
 “Afterwards I wasn’t sure but that was really my fault!
 “He’s an outstanding boy and life gave me a second chance to work with him and hopefully we can both use it.”
 Klopp continued: “The time I have spent with Sadio Mane has been fantastic.
 “I love the boy! He is an outstanding player.”
