Head coach of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club, Fidelis Ilechukwu has said that the 2018/19 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season will be a fresh start for his wards as they face Enyimba this Sunday in Aba.
Ilechukwu and his charges will be guests to seven-time NPFL champions, the Peoples Elephant in one of the opening fixtures of Group A of the new NPFL season which will take place at the Enyimba International Stadium with the hope of starting the season on a good note.
This meeting will be the sixth between the Olukoya Boys and the Aba-based side. Enyimba claimed the available three points in the last fixture last season while the remaining four ended in a draw.
The MFM FC gaffer is not perturbed despite the result of the previous meetings as he looks forward to kickstart this season with a large number of newly-signed players and hopes his men can make a huge statement from the opening day contest.
“It’s going to be a fresh start for us playing against Enyimba Football Club one of the best in the Nigerian league.
“MFM Football Club are a good side as well although I know it’s going to be difficult because we lost a lot of our players to other clubs.
“Last season we lost eight players but the players we have now are young and as well new players. I know it’s going to be a little bit difficult but we will do anything possible to get a good result,” Ilechukwu told MFM FC media department.
