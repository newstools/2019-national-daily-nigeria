The presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar has been spotted at an airport in Washington, the United States of America alongside Nigeria’s Senate President Bukola Saraki.

Atiku arrived to a friendly reception at the Washington Dulles Airport, where a bunch of flowers awaited him. It was his first time in the states since a restriction hindering him from going there was reportedly lifted.

He is visiting the United States of America for the first time since reports about his travel restriction to the country being lifted came out in October 2018.

The earlier avoidance is allegedly as a result of many reports placing him in danger of an arrest due to his connection with a US Congressman Williams Jefferson.

Atiku had reportedly facilitated a deal with the legislator to help with improving broadband services in Nigeria when he was Vice-President.

His visit to the US was confirmed by former Minister of Aviation Osita Chidoka who wrote in a tweet.

The possibility of an imminent visit to the US since a travel restriction to the country was reportedly lifted, has been long debated.

Recall that Gbenga Daniel who is the Director-General of the Atiku Presidential Campaign Organisation (APCO) confirmed in October 2018, that the PDP candidate had received “signals from American officials” to apply for a visa to visit the United States of America.
