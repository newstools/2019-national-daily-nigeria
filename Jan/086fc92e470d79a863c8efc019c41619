The Social Democratic Party, SDP, guber candidate in the Osun election Â last September may have dumped his party and joined the ruling APC.
Senator Iyiola Omisore was sighted in company with Osun Gov. Gboyega Oyetola and APC leaders visiting the palace of Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ovunwusi.
Governor Oyetola is on a thank you visit to Ife zone for their support during the election which he was declared the winner.
In the run-off that nudged Oyetola ahead of his PDP rival Gboyega Adeleke, Onisore pitched his camp with the APC, and urged his followers to ensure Oyetola win the election.
The SDP was angry with the senator for his decision. He was also suspended for a year by Afenifere, a pan Yoruba group he belongs to, which felt betrayed by the action.
