A Nigerian-born British lawmaker, Fiona Onasanya has been sentenced to three months in jail for lying about a speeding ticket in the UK.
While pronouncing the judgement, the judge told Onasanya, “You have not simply let yourself down, you have let down those who look to you for inspiration, your party, your profession and parliament.”
The 35-year-old solicitor was clocked going 41mph in a 30mph zone in the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, in July 2017, reports Independent UK.
The prosecution alleged she went to collude with her brother Festus Onasanya, who has been jailed for 10 months to avoid a speeding ticket.
The court was told she was sent a notice of intended prosecution to fill out, but it was sent back naming the driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of Festus, who was away visiting his parents in Russia.
When the court found Fiona Onasanya guilty, earlier this month,  she was expelled from the Labour party, on whose platform, she had won her seat at the parliament.
She may yet lose her seat, if 10 per cent of her constituents sign a recall petition.
