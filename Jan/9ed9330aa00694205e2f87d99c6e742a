The Deputy President of the Senate, Barrister Ike Ekweremadu, has demanded President Muhammadu Buhari to withdraw the suit against the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen. The Deputy President of the Senate noted that the suit against the CJN is ill-advised and dangerous for the country’s democracy
DSP Ekweremadu, accordingly, requested the Attorney General of the Federation to immediately withdraw the charges against the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen.
He was of the view that such action can divide the country and portray Nigeria as a country that is very low in upholding the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.
Ekweremadu had declared: “I consider the charges against the Chief Justice of Nigeria, His Lordship, Justice Walter Onnoghen, as ill-advised and dangerous, especially, after similar attempts at the leadership of the National Assembly failed.
“This is extremely dangerous for our democracy and can only divide the nation further as well as mark us out as a country very low in upholding the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.
“I advise the Attorney General of the Federation to immediately withdraw the charges and apologise to the judiciary. We certainly can’t travel this road.”
