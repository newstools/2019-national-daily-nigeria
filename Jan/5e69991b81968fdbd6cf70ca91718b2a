Reports of Chelsea’s interest in Callum Wilson is a huge compliment for the Bournemouth striker, coach Eddie Howe says.

The Stamford Bridge outfit have been linked with the attacker in the build up to the January transfer window and are said to be willing to pay £50 million ($64m) for him.

Although Howe wants to hold on to one of his star players, he says the speculation surrounding Wilson should be taken as a compliment.
