The assistant coach of the Super Eagles  and former  Rangers  TA,Imama  Amapakabo said recently that it is so unfortunate that Kastina United  Coach  Abdullahi Biffo has been kidnapped, when i heard the news honestly it made my heart skip hollow.

The young gentleman who have dived into coaching passionately, in the cause of his line of duty was kidnapped,Amapakabo explained.

And up to date nothing has being done, it is getting worst the more, nine days no trace of his whereabout, it is a really dark moment for me as a coach.

My hearts bleeds with pains with the thought of what he might be going through in the hands of the kidnappers, the trauma he is passing through right now.

This is really a big challenge for all coaches because it could happen to any one of us, it is not something to be relaxed about,  nine days is not a joke talking about a life at stake, nothing has being done about it and it’s so disheartening.

My fervent prayers is that where ever he is right now, God should watch over him and bring him out in safety from this unsavory situation.

The assistant coach of the Super Eagles concluded by saying it could happen to any of us, so let’s come out together on his behalf to show our love and support to his family.

National Daily reporter chatted with Coach Biffo on the 10th of January, 2019 when he was said coaching in Nigeria is not easy ,its like a military job.

According to National Daily research Kastina United are owing him three months salaries.
