Npt ling after a kiss and make up scene at Council of State meeting in Abuja Tuesday, Former President Olusegun Obasanjo and President Muhammadu Buhari are at again.
Obasanjo in an interview with the BBC lunged at Buhari, saying the present government is worse than he thought when he endorsed the APC candidate in 2014.
He accused Buhari of nepotism and bad management of the economy, adding those in the Buhari government will not only go to jail, they will go to hell–if their corrupt acts are exposed
“Whoever that God does not expose his sins to the public is the person whose secret is kept,” he told the BBC Yoruba service.
“What I am saying is that where we are today, our present situation… if you look at those who are there today and our boss (Buhari), I insist that Atiku will do better than them,” he said
Although Obasanjo said he has no stakes in the PDP candidate and ex-VP Atiku Abubakar becoming the next president, he vouched for him.
“I did not say he (Atiku) will behave like Jesus.  I did not say he will behave like Prophet Muhammed,’ he said. “But he will do better, in fact twice better than what we have at present.”
According to him,  Buhari did not know anything about economy. Have you not seen it? I said he did not know about diplomatic relations, have you not seen it?
On why he’s now speaking for his former vic president, Obasanjo said Atiku had atoned for his sins when he came to him in Abeokuta and sought forgiveness.
He also accuse the president of giving priorities to his ethnic group when appointing people into sensitive positions.
“Look at what is happening, the person that is leading us says he cannot appoint any other tribes into the posts he considers sensitive because he does not trust them,” he said, referring to Buhari’s position when he was choosing his cabinet.
“If he cannot trust my tribe and your tribe what is the benefit? And he still wants my tribe and your tribe to vote for him.”
