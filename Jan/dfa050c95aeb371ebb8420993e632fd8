Nigeria’s former Vice President and Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to choose a date to debate with him.
Abubakar had shunned a Presidential debate in Abuja because of the absence of Buhari.
However, Abubakar, on his twitter handle challenged Buhari to come out and stop hiding by debating with him on issues pertaining to the nation.
“I, however, challenge President Buhari to choose a date and time for a debate where he will be present and I will be there, hopefully with the other candidates as well,” he said.
