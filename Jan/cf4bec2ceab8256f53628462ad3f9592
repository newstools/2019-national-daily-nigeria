Warns lawmakers against impeachment Ambode

Thousands of youths besieged the Lagos State House of Assembly on Thursday afternoon to protest the plot to impeach Governor Akinwumi Ambode. The protesters cautioned the lawmakers not to cause the state to burn.
The protesters displayed diverse placard warning the legislators of the consequences of going ahead to impeach incumbent Governor Ambode. One of the placards read: “Leave Ambode alone to finish his tenure or else APC will lose Lagos.” Another one reads: “Lagos People reject planned impeachment of Ambode. It’s self service.” Others read: “stop scaring investors and tourists from Lagos;” “don’t set Lagos ablaze.”
The protest is led by a group known as “Lagos Peoples Assembly.”
It will be recalled that at the plenary of the House on Monday, January 28, 2019, there were allegations that Governor Ambode in the 2019 budget which is yet to present to the State House of Assembly, has already commenced expenditure of budgetary allocations.
The lawmakers, thereafter, ordered Governor Ambode to within one week to respond to the allegations.
Meanwhile, the protesters who were expression their grieves at the entrance to the Assembly complex, declared, “we say no to Impeachment”, “Let Us Welcome PMB and PYO Peacefully for Lagos Rally”, “We Stand with Ambode”.
