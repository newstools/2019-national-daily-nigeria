These ten players will make a world of difference to their respective teams in the upcoming Nigeria Women Premier League Super 4 Competition taking place in Lagos from the 23rd to the 26th of January 2019.
Four clubs Bayelsa Queens, Rivers Angels, Nasarawa Amazons and Sunshine Queens will all battle for the for the prestigious NWPL title.
The Lagos 2018 edition of the Super 4 is almost at our doorstep, and many players will be seeking to write their names in the history books. Here are the top 10 players to look out for in the Super 4.
#10 – Joy Jerry *(Bayelsa Queens)*
Jerry Joy might only be 18 years old, but she has already proved her worth by guiding Bayelsa Queens to the Super 4 stage in the absence of main captain Joy Bokiri who was initially in Spain before joining the ‘Restoration Girls’ in the remainder of the season.
Joy Jerry should play a pivotal role in Lagos. She is quick and intelligent on the ball. Always in the mood to improve her talent. She is definitely one of the players to watch in the upcoming Super 4
# 9 – Chiamaka Nnadozie *( Rivers Angels)*
A modern day goalkeeper and generally regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the NWPL. Chiamaka brings a slashing athleticism to the position, and doesn’t hesitate to charge out to challenge strikers. She has Super Falcons Number one goalkeeper Tochukwu Oluehi to compete with in that position. Both goalkeepers should make it in time from China to join their team in Lagos.
# 8 – Ihuoma Goodness *(Sunshine Queens)*
Ihuoma Goodness was an integral part of the Owena Mermaid team during the league session. Her wealth of experience from the midfield helped Sunshine Queens achieve some of their aims. She should do so well in Lagos.
# 7 – Amirat Adebisi *(Bayelsa Queens)*
The former FC Robo Queens midfielder has all what it takes to supply passes upfront for strikers to score. The mercurial midfielder joined Bayelsa Queens from Delta Queens and really did alot to impress the home fans in Yenagoa. Every team wants a midfielder like her, she is young, talented, has good vision, ball control and strength. If Bayelsa Queens are to win the Super 4 she will be the key
# 6 – Ebere Okoye *(Nasarawa Amazons)*
Strong and reliable defender, Ebere is no doubt one of the best defender in the NWPL. Ferocious and hard to beat by intending forwards.  She will play a major role as her team looks forward to retain the title they won at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin. .
# 5 – Rofiat Sule *(Rivers Angels)*
Back to back top scorer in the NWPL while she was in Yenagoa with Bayelsa Queens. A diminutive and dangerous striker. Rofiat always have an eye for goals whenever she is on the pitch and will be hoping to score some important goals for her side on Lagos.
#4 – Joy Bokiri *(Bayelsa Queens)*
Joy Bokiri became captain of Bayelsa Queens at a very young age and have since then became a cult heroine in Yenagoa. A very talented attacking midfielder and one who can single handedly change the course of a game. The team is clearly built around the diminutive star and she should play well in Lagos.
#3 – Maryam Ibrahim *(Nasarawa Amazons)*
.
The perfect defender. No more words required to describe her. She has the height, she has the pace to stop the counter attacks and especially she is very good in the air. We are already seeing the importance of her in the defence of Nasarawa Amazons. An experienced and dependable defender.
#2 – Evelyn Nwabuoku *(Rivers Angels)*
Her wealth of experience was just what River Angels needed to ride on during the season.  She was voted player of the month in September and lifted the AITEO Cup or her side.
The former Super Falcons Captain is very firm in the midfield and also has eyes for goals.  She will be very important for her side on Lagos.
#1 – Tina Oyatheleme *(Sunshine Queens)*
The attacking midfielder scored some important goals for her side during the open league and is definitely one of the reasons her side is competing at the Super 4.
She is quick on the ball and have some leadership qualities which gives her some added advantage over  others in that same position.  She is one player that Owena Mermaids will be relying on in Lagos.
