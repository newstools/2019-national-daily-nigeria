Insists Buhari is Aware of CJN’s Arraignment

The PDP has accused Osinbajo of not telling Nigerians and the international community the truth about the intimidation of the Chief Justice of Nigeria in his statement that Buhari was not aware of the plans by the executive arm to arraign Onnoghen before the CCT.
The Director of Media and Publicity of PDP Presidential Campaign, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement in Abuja, said Osinbajo should know that Nigerians are aware there is no way such high level decision, like the arraignment of the CJN in a court, would be taken without the awareness, input and clearance by the president.
The PDP challenged the vice president to explain why the president did not stop the arraignment on Monday or said anything on the matter since then.
The party contested that the presidency was only trying to sway public opinion on the matter following the outrage by Nigerians against the arraignment of the CJN.
“If the avowal by Vice President Osinbajo was true, then it goes to confirm the assertion that President Buhari is not in charge of governance but has outsourced the responsibilities of his office to unelected individuals due to his incompetence.
“Vice President Osinbajo’s assertion has also confirmed the claims by our First Lady, Aisha Buhari, that a cabal has taken over the control of the presidency, for which she forcefully called on Nigerians to take back their country,” PDP declared.
