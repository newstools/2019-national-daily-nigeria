Buhari disagree with Oshiomhole


The presidential campaign of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Owerri, Imo State, generated obvious mix-up over the choice of governorship candidate in the state. President Muhammadu Buhari was observed to have taken side with Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State in the rift with APC national chairman, Adams Okorocha, over APC governorship candidate in Imo State. Okoeocha who has been sponsoring his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, on the platform of the Action Allaince (A.A), continued to mobilize support for President Buhari in the presidential poll while mobilizing support for Nwosu on the platform of AA for the governorship election. Oshiomhole and APC National Working Committee (NWC) have been supporting Senator Hope Uzodinma as the party’s governorship candidate in Imo State.
Adams Oshiomole, at the presidential campaign attended by APC and AA supporters at the Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri, had declared: “we are not in alliance with any political party, so, vote for our governorship candidate in Imo State, who is Senator Hope Uzodimma.”
To the consternation Oshiomhole and APC leaders in the south eats, President Buhari at the campaign stated: “Forget intra-political struggles, Imo should vote any candidate they like; choose whoever you want to vote for.”
Governor Okorocha had maintained his stand while he told the Igbo people: “it may not be correct to say that President Buhari truly hate Igbo people.” The governor further told the people why they should vote for Buhari for the NEXT LEVEL in 2019.
