The House of Representatives on Thursday, stepped down the consideration of the 2019 budget to enable members to study the document.
 
The development followed a motion by Chairman, House Committee on Rules and Business, Rep Edward Pwajok, at the second plenary for the year presided over by the Speaker, Rep. Yakubu Dogara in Abuja.
 
The House had on resumption from its annual recess on Wednesday deferred deliberations on the Budget Bill until Thursday due to the death of a member, Rep. Abayomi Ayeola (APC-Lagos).
 
President Muhammadu Buhari on Dec. 19, 2018, unveiled a federal budget of N8.83 trillion for the 2019 fiscal year.
 
Moving the motion for stepping down the bill, Rep. Pwajok (PDP-Plateau) said the step became necessary because of the late distribution of the budget documents to members.
 
According to him, the suspension of the deliberation on the 2019 Budget Bill to next week is to allow members to digest its content.
 
The lawmaker then called for the bill to be stepped down.
 
The speaker, who ruled in favour of the motion, gave an assurance that the assembly would expedite action on the bill.
