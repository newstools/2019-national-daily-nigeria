The vice chairman of the Ebonyi state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Samuel Ode-Oru, has defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the forthcoming 2019 general elections.

Ode-Oru defected alongside over six thousand members to the PDP few days for President Muhammad Buhari to flag off his campaign in the state for his re-election.

National daily gathers that Ode-Oru said Governor David Umahi’s achievements in the state since he took over the mantle of leadership informed his decision to join the PDP.


He said: “We will never campaign against Engr. David Umahi. He has an identity, he has performed creditably. I am decamping to PDP with all my supporters to support what he is doing in the state; he has transformed the state.”
