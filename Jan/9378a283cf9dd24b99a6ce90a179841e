The Rivers state Police Command has denied the rumour circulating on social media that the command has arrested Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi over corruption charges.

A report had gone viral alleging that Amaechi was arrested by the new commissioner of police in Rivers state, Belel Usman on Wednesday.

However in a statement signed by the command’s PRO, Nnamdi Omoni, he said it has become increasingly necessary at this stage to put the records straight and state unequivocally as follows: That the Ex-Governor of Rivers State and Hon. Minister of Transportation, RT Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi was never arrested by the Commissioner of Police, Rivers State Command or any Security Agency for that matter, as reported by the AIT medium.


“The attention of the Rivers State Police Command has been drawn to an item of news making the rounds in the Social Media, credited to AIT Nigeria News, on the purported arrest of the Ex- Governor of Rivers State and Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi in his home by the Commissioner of Police, Rivers State Police Command at the early hours of today 23/1/2019, on the allegation of corruption, directed by the Inspector General of Police.

That the general public is hereby enjoined to disregard and discountenance the above news report as being mischievous, ill-conceived, diversionary and only intended to undermine the security situation in the State and harass the Nigeria Police Force and the person of the Ex-Governor and Hon. Minister of Transportation.

The Commissioner of Police wishes to assure the general public that there is no cause for alarm, as the state is peaceful and all business activities are going on peacefully. The Command under the watch of the Commissioner of Police, CP Usman A. Belel is committed to ensuring that the existing peace is sustained.”
