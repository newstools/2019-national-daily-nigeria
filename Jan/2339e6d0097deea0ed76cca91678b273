A 31-year-old tenant, Abass Babatunde, was arraigned in Lagos State on Tuesday for beating up his 63-year-old landlord.

Babatunde, who resides at No. 8 Omo Osagie St., Iju Ishaga, a Lagos suburb, is facing a two-count of assault and malicious damage before an Ikeja  Chief Magistrates’ court

The Prosecutor, Sgt. Michael Unah, told the court that the accused allegedly assaulted his landlord, Mr Rahmon Adewale, by punching him on the face, following an unresolved argument.


He said that the accused committed the offences on December 26 at 9.30 p.m at his residence.

Unah said that the accused maliciously damaged the complainant’s entrance gate padlock, worth N2, 500.
According to the prosecutor, the accused met the complainant while trying to lock up the gate, and he told him that he wanted to go out to purchase some drugs for his sick baby.


He said that the complainant refused him going out, stating that it was too late to go out.

He added that out of annoyance the accused damaged the padlock and beat up the complainant.

The offences contravened Sections 172 and 339 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015, (Revised).

National daily reports that Section 172 stipulates three years for assault while Section 339 prescribes two years for malicious damage if convicted.

The Chief Magistrate, Mr A. A. Fashola, granted the accused N5, 000 bail with one surety.

Fashola said the surety must be gainfully employed with evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government and adjourned the case until February 18 for mention.
