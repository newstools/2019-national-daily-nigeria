The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has denied having any contract with foreign media consultant, David Pride.
David Pride, had on Saturday announced on Twitter that he has been hired as a social media consultant to Atiku Campaign.
“Excited to announce that I have been contracted as the social media consultant for 2019 Presidential Candidate of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar. His vision to get Nigeria Working Again and taking care of the less fortunate is one I support and I’m excited to,” Pride had tweeted @DavidaPride.
But Atiku in a statement on Monday said Pride is an impostor, and people should disregard him.
“A certain David Pride who claims to have been contracted by the Atiku Campaign and announced himself as a media consultant is an impostor unknown to His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar.
“Please disregard, his claim is false,” the statement read.
