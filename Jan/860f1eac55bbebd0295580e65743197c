Follow reports that names of dead and retired Judges featured on the list of the 250 Judges sworn in last Saturday, the court of Appeal has denied the allegation.

Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Mohammed last weekend inaugurated a 250-Judge Election Petition Tribunal and rumours have spread that some deceased members of the bar were included.

But a statement on Wednesday by the Media Officer of the Court of Appeal, Sa’adatu Kachalla said such reports were false.

He said, “The attention of the Court of Appeal has been drawn to a malicious publication making the round in some portals that the names of 10 dead Judges featured in the list of the 250 Judges sworn-in in January 26, 2019 as Election Petition Tribunal Chairmen and Members.

“In view of the above we wish to state that there was no name of a dead or retired Judge on the list we sent to the Supreme Court for the swearing-in ceremony by His Lordship the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria Mr Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad”
