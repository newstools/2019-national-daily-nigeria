Two pro-PDP public commentators and politicians who originated fake news about the EFCC raid CJN Walter Onnoghen residence on Tuesday are going to face questioning at the EFCC Abuja office Wednesday.
Femi Fani-Kayode and Yinka Odumakin, in tweets and videos, circulated what turned out to be fake news on Tuesday—that the house of the embattled CJN was surrounded by the EFCC operatives.
Onnoghen himself denied the claim.
EFCC’s spokesman Tony Orilade said the news could affect national security, so  Fani-Kayode and Odumakin have clarification to make.
And if they have no clarification to make, they may not be released, Orilade told his audience at the conference of Online Publishers Association of Nigeria in Abuja.
Fani-Kayode has, however, backtracked though he has yet to turn h9mself in.
“Yesterday I was informed by usually reliable sources that EFCC were positioned outside CJN’s home. I have since discovered that the men were not from EFCC and I removed the posting. The error is regretted,” he posted on Facebook Wednesday.
Not done yet, he charged again with another allegation.
“Meanwhile can the Federal Government tell us which agency sent those men and why they beat a retreat? Again is it true that a television journalist was arrested at the scene and his camera and footage confiscated? If so, why?
“Finally is it true that the Attorney General has ordered the NFIU to freeze Onnoghen’s bank accounts. Questions, questions, questions! The tyranny continues unabated.”
Onnoghen is embroiled in an alleged dodgy declaration of assets, and he was due for arraignment at the Code of Conduct Tribunal Monday.
He, however, did not show up, having got restraining orders against the CCB, the CCT, and the attorney general of the federation.
