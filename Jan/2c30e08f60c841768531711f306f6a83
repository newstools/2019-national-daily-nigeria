Describe him as friend of the throne

Senator Shehu Sani, representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, in the National Assembly, at the weekend took the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, and several others who pretend to be unalloyed loyalists of President Muhammadu Buhari to the cleaners. Sani said they display chameleon loyalty whenever they are in government and have close relations with the President.
The senator noted that those people are always at the service of every incumbent president.
Senator Sani in a tweet stated that “many of those elites who once insulted Buhari and said they can die for Obasanjo when he was in office, are here today insulting Obasanjo and now saying they can die for Buhari.”
The Senator declared that they are “Friends of the throne always mistaken as friends of the King.”
Governor El-Rufai had insulted the incumbent President Buhari, called him unprintable names when he was Minister of the Federal Capital Territory on the appointment of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
