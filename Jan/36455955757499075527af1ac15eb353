PDP’s presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar will soon touch down in Washington DC where the U.S Chamber of Commerce will receive him for a meeting in the build-up to the February presidential election, according to his aides.
Atiku secured his visa last December after 12 years of America-phobia.
The former VP was allegedly complicit in bribery scandal involving Halliburton and a U.S senator who was jailed eventually.
Atiku case was complicated by reason of the friction between him and his boss then former President Olusegun Obasanjo who used to taunt him that the Yola politician dare not step on America’s soil.
However, things took a positive turn when he and Obasanjo kissed and made up last year in a bid to kick out President Muhammadu Buhari whom Obasnajo has hard feelings for over the second-term ambition.
And sources had it that Obasanjo was instrumental in getting Atiku some kind of diplomatic visa which enabled him travel to the US.
The ruling APC has made an issue of Atiku’s fear of the US, and, once a while, jibes at him with reference to his alleged corruption.
