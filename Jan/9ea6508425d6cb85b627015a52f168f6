Chelsea will report Bayern Munich to FIFA if they find evidence of an illegal approach by the Bundesliga club to Callum Hudson-Odoi, his family or his representatives.
Bayern have bid £35million for 18-year-old Hudson-Odoi, understood to be an initial £15m with £20m in add-ons.
‘He is fast, good at dribbling, he would fit very well into our team,’ said Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic on Wednesday as he addressed the media at a training camp in Qatar.
Premier League rules prohibit such public comment but Bayern have not broken any FIFA regulations unless they are found to have ‘tapped up’ Hudson-Odoi.
Chelsea do not want to sell but they could lose him for next to nothing when his contract expires in summer 2020.
Hudson-Odoi has been sounding out Berlin-born team-mate Antonio Rudiger.
‘He asked me about Germany,’ said Rudiger. ‘I can advise him but at the end of the day he decides his future.
‘You can see it from both sides. He can develop here but he can develop in Germany as well. And don’t forget Bayern Munich are also a big club. For his future, I wish him all the best but I just wish he stays with us.’
