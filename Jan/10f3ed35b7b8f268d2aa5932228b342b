mother still at large


By Chioma Obinagwam with Agency Report

The police is on the trail of a mother, who connived with others to bury her three-week-old baby girl alive, after it was discovered and dug up by locals who heard its cry and rushed to the hospital.

Residents in Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh in northern India heard the cries of the infant on Friday evening, when temperatures had dropped to just 37F (3C).

They quickly dug her frigid body out and rushed her to a hospital where her condition was stabilised.

Passer-by Dharmendra Kumar, who first heard the baby’s cries, said, “I was passing through the area at half past seven when I heard a baby crying.

“The sound of her cries led me to the spot. I quickly dig up the earth and found her alive.

He took her to the nearby government hospital and informed the police.

Kumar said, “It is such a cruel act.

“I cannot believe how can a person could abandon the baby in this cold weather.”

A police investigation found out the infant’s parents – a 30-year-old man and 28-year-old woman, had buried their third-born along with two relatives on the instructions of a shaman who claimed the infant was possessed.

Police said they have arrested the father, the aunt, her husband and the shaman while the mother remains on the run.
