Rising political tension as the 2019 general elections approach is taking its tolls on the Nigerian stock market with investors on the Nigerian Stock Exchange losing a whopping N105bn in just three days.

The market had appreciated in the first week of 2019, moving from red to green, but all that have been reversed.

NSE market capitalisation, representing investors worth on the Exchange closed at N11.614 billion from N11.719 billion it closed last Friday, pulling the Year to Date, YtD, performance back from green territory to red, at -0.9 percent.

According to capital market operators, the reversal in the future of the stock market is attributable to the worsened political tension involving the presidency and the judiciary arm of the government over the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Walter Onnoghen.
