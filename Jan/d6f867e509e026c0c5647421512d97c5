The Senate Minority Leader, Abiodun Olujimi, is engaging the former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, over his alteration of the list of Campaign Council members in Ekiti State for the Presidential Campaign of PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in the state. Thus, the Senate Minority Leader is challenging the former Ekiti State Governor over who controls the presidential campaign structure in the state.
Accordingly, the Senate Minority Leader, Abiodun Olujimi, set up a campaign council in the state for the Atiku campaign simultaneously with former Governor Ayodele Fayose, therefore, making Ekiti State have two campaign councils for the PDP presidential campaign for Atiku Abubakar.
Olujimi, was gathered to have accused Fayose of changing a list of Atiku campaign council consented to by all party stakeholders in the state.
“It was the party executives and leaders that were picked from the 16 local governments. They sat down, looked through the entire PDP and decided on a number of persons, about a hundred of them.
“They were supposed to have been inaugurated on January 3. All of a sudden, we understand that Governor Fayose came and told the excos that he was not pleased with what they did, that he needed to be the one that would do the composition,” she had said.
Fayose, however, denied the allegation, saying he would not join issue with any group or faction in the party.
“You don’t make an issue out of this. We have gotten here today and have seen the House of Representatives members, we have seen the House of Assembly members are here, we have seen the elders are here, what else do you want again.
“There will be people who feel aggrieved one way or the other, I cannot go and beg anybody in their house. I have done what I am supposed to do to come and inaugurate this one,” he said.
