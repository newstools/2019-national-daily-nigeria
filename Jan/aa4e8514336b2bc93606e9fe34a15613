Nigeria National League Champions, Kada City will be looking for a positive start to life in the  elite league this Sunday in a match day 3 encounter against fellow newly promoted side, Gombe United.

National Daily learnt that it will be the second time in the space of twelve days that both sides will be meeting in a competitive game.

The first was  during the NNL Super 8 playoffs in Aba where it finished goalless and both sides picked promotion tickets afterwards before Kada City eventually emerged overall champions  beating Bendel Insurance 4-3 on penalties after playing 1-1 in normal time.

Kada City will be relying on their scintillating form which saw them won eight consecutive matches during the second tier campaign and four unbeaten run in the playoffs less than two weeks ago.
