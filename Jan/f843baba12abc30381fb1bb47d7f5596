Besiktas have made a loan offer to take France youth international Georges-Kevin N’Koudou on a temporary basis from Tottenham, reports L’Equipe.

The winger is thought to be currently surplus to plans for Mauricio Pochettino and had previously been linked with a number of clubs back in his homeland.

However, the Turkish giants have now emerged as favourites to take N’Koudou away from his current club in North London.
