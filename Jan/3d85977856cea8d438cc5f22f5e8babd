President Muhammadu Buhari has summoned the APC senators in the Senate to a meeting at the Presidential Villa on Monday.
The meeting is about CJN Walter Onnoghen suspended over allegation of false asset declaration.
Onnoghen was suspended on Friday by President Buhari based on an ex parte order granted by the Code of Conduct Tribunal where he is facing six counts of false assets declaration filed against him by the Code of Conduct Bureau.
The Senate also is convening Tuesday on emergency over the CJN suspension.
The APC senators’ meeting with the President, in a dinner, will be about taking position because two-thirds of the Senate is required to remove a CJN if the executive initiates the move.
Invitations to the meeting were signed by the Director General of the APC Presidential Campaign Organisation, who is also the Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi.
The national leadership of the APC would also attend the meeting.
Also, members of the APC Caucus in the House of Representatives have scheduled an emergency meeting for Monday (today).
The Majority Leader, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, called the meeting, according to a text message circulating among the lawmakers on Sunday.
But the PDP has alleged the meeting id about bribing the APC senators to protect Buhari from parliamentary sanctions for constitutional breaches.
The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Sunday stated that this.
“President Buhari is not only apprehensive that the Senate might sanction him for violating the constitution and usurping its statutory duties regarding the handling of issues related to a CJN, the parliament may also open an inquest into how President Buhari, who parades himself as Mr Integrity, allegedly procured an order from the CCT upon which he announced the illegal suspension of the CJN,” he said in the statement.
