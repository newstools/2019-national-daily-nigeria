The vastly-experienced Czech custodian feels the time is right to walk away as he has “won every single trophy possible”.

He will turn 37 shortly after the current campaign comes to a close and admits he can open a new chapter away from the field happy that he has achieved more than he could ever have dreamed of.

The Gunners goalkeeper can’t get enough chance under new manager Unai Emery losing the competition to Germany international Bernd Leno.

The 36-year-old joined Arsenal from London rivals Chelsea in 2015, and he will now bid Emirates Stadium farewell at the end of the season.

Open letter from Cech:


Considered one of the best goalkeepers of all time, Čech holds a number of goalkeeping records.

He registered the Premier League record for fewest appearances required to reach 100 clean sheets, having done so in 180 appearances, the most number of clean sheets in a season, as well as the record for the most clean sheets in Premier League history (202).
