Chelsea have deals in place to land Zenit’s Leandro Paredes and Cagliari’s Nicolo Barella, reports the Mirror.
Paredes appears to be the more likely of the pair to move to Stamford Bridge, with Barella reluctant to leave Serie A in the middle of the season.
Both midfielders are being eyed as replacements for Cesc Fabregas, whose move to Monaco was confirmed on Friday.
