The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) has announced the debarment of a Nigerian firm, ALG Global Concept Nigeria Limited, a construction company registered in Nigeria and Mr Abuharaira Gero, its managing director, for a period of 36 months.
According to the bank, an investigation conducted by the bank’s Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption established that ALG Global Concept and its managing director engaged in numerous fraudulent practices in bidding for a construction contract under the Agricultural Transformation Agenda Support Programme Phase One in Nigeria.
In a statement, AfDB, explained that the debarment rendered the company and its Managing Director ineligible to participate in bank-financed projects during the debarment period.
The debarment qualifies for cross-debarment by other multilateral development banks under the Agreement for Mutual Recognition of Debarment Decisions, including the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank Group.
 While participating in a tender for the conduct of construction of social infrastructure in Niger State, the company misrepresented its experience in conducting such construction contracts as well as by submitting false bid security, AfDB added.
