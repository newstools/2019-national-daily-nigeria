Juventus are reportedly keen on signing Marcelo as Cristiano Ronaldo is ‘obsessed’ with bringing his former Real Madrid teammate to Turin.
According to AS, Marcelo is now ‘beginning to consider’ leaving Madrid after losing his place to youth graduate Sergio Reguilon in recent weeks.
The newspaper explains the left-back ‘maintains a great friendship and speaks regularly’ with Ronaldo, who in turn ‘hasn’t stopped trying’ to convince the Brazilian to join him at Juve.
It is warned Marcelo will have ‘to express his desire to leave’ in order to force through a transfer, similar to how the No 7 got his move last summer.
Nonetheless, the Bianconeri would be of the opinion that Marcelo is the ‘top-level player who further raises the level of their squad’, despite Alex Sandro only signing a new contract last month
