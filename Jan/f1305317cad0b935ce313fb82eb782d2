Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries FC head coach Fidelis Ilechukwu has described his team’s 1-0 victory over CAF Confederation Cup campaigner, Rangers International FC as a “precious win” in one of Matchday 4 fixtures of the Nigeria Professional Football (NPFL) played at the Soccer Temple, Agege Stadium on Wednesday.

MFM FC claimed another maximum points at home by putting an end to Rangers six games unbeaten run in all competitions courtesy of a 25th minute strike from new import Kabir Adewale Adeniji.

Adeniji made his NPFL debut from the bench against Kwara United and announced his arrival in the Nigerian top league scoring the second goal of the encounter with a glancing header.

Ilechukwu disclosed to MFM FC Media shortly after the entertaining match how important the 1-0 was to his wards.

“The victory is very important to us.

“We won today and we need to prepare very well for the next game because we are going to play Rivers United but there’s hope going to Rivers.

“Rangers is a big team with a good coach and quality players as you can see the victory is so precious to me because we need it more than them,” said Ilechukwu.

The Olukoya Boys have now moved from fourth spot in Group A to first position with six points from two NPFL games. They will be on the road this weekend to Rivers United.
