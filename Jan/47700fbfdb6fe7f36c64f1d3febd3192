Borussia Dortmund have made contact with Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha’s representatives over a summer move, reports The Guardian.

The Bundesliga side are eyeing the 26-year-old as a replacement for Christian Pulisic, who will join Chelsea at season’s end.

Palace are likely to demand at least £50 million (€57m/$65m) for Zaha, who is keen on a move that will allow him to play Champions League football.


The 31-year-old joins until the end of the season, with the Blues retaining a purchase option

Chelsea have confirmed the signing of striker Gonzalo Higuain on loan from Juventus.

The 31-year-old spent the first half of the season on loan at Milan, who are nearing a deal for Krzysztof Piatek as the Argentine’s replacement.

“When the opportunity to join Chelsea presented itself I had to take it,” Higuain said.

“It’s a team I’ve always liked that has a lot of history, a wonderful stadium and they play in the Premier League, a league I’ve always wanted to play in.”
