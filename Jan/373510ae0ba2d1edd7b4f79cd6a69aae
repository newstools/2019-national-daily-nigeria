The United States of America has warned its citizens in Nigeria to be at alert over threats of attacks by the Boko Haram and ISIS West Africa insurgents in the North.
The US in a statement on its website, cautioned that the insurgents had threatened to attack public places during the 2019 general elections in the country.
The US noted that though it did not have information on whether such attacks were targeted at its embassy or not, it advised US citizens to review their movements and keep a low profile.
“There is an increase in ISIS propaganda videos specifically directed to Nigeria and the ongoing civil unrest in Borno State and the North-East.
“ISIS West Africa and Boko Haram have both stated they plan to disrupt the upcoming 2019 presidential elections by conducting attacks on Nigerian security and infrastructure as well as places of gathering such as markets, hotels and malls.
“While we have no specific threat information to the US Embassy or within Nigeria during the election season, US citizens in Nigeria should remember to follow personal security precautions on a regular basis.
“Actions to take: Expect additional police and military checkpoints and possible road blocks throughout the country.
“Carry proper identification, including a US passport with a current Nigerian visa, if needed; exercise caution when walking or driving at night; review travel routes and times to reduce time and place predictability; avoid crowds and demonstrations; be aware of your surroundings; keep a low profile; stay alert in public places, including schools, hospitals, government facilities, places of worship, tourist locations, and transportation hubs,” the Embassy declared.
The US embassy further told American citizens to monitor press reports and review their travel advisory for Nigeria.
