Sheriff Bashir of Katsina United who scored the only goal for Katsina United as at 90 minutes of play ,National Daily learnt.
It is was a very tough match and our opponent Wikki Tourist Fc gave us a good fight but we were able to pick the three points .
I am so excited i got the only goal of the match as at 90 minutes, it remains precious to me because it is my first goal in the Katsina United colour.
I just joined the club not long ago and i scored the first goal of the season for Katsina United which is a thing of joy and it is a memory i won’t forget, being the player who opened the goal passage for Katsina United 2019 season.
The goal is an amazing one for me for the fact that coach Abdullahi Biffo brought me to Katsina United and for sometimes now due to the tragedy that struck the club for a while, but eventually the day i scored my goal, was the day he was released, so i dedicate my goal to my Coach Biffo.
We keep pushing as a team,  we will fight harder,  to be able to beat  our next opponent Remo stars and by God’s grace we hope to pick points in away matches.
The newly signed Katsina United player concluded by saying, thank God for the first three points of the season.
