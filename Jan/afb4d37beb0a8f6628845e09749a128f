President Muhammadu Buhari has denied requesting the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen to resign over the controversial prosecution on charges of false declaration of assets.
The Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, dismissed reports that the President demanded the resignation of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen.
National Daily gathered that Ojudu challenged anyone who says Buhari asked for the resignation of the CJN.
“Buhari never at any time demanded CJ’s resignation. I challenge anyone who says so to cite the pronouncement, the press statement or quote any public official who made such announcement,” the Adviser had said.
