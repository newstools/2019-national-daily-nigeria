The National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno, at a meeting with the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) in Abuja on Tuesday, said that politicians who are afraid of losing in the 2019 elections are planning to disrupt the polls.
Monguno, however, assured that security forces are prepared to deal with anybody who attempts to engage in any act that could destabilise the exercise, though, the NSA acknowledged the neutrality of security agencies.
He cautioned that there is zero tolerance for political thuggery and possession of illegal arms.
The NSA declared: “Reports reaching me have revealed that some individuals that are uncertain of their fate in the elections are plotting to participate in widespread violence aimed at scuttling the polls.
“There are indications that these unscrupulous elements are already mobilising merchants of violence, including armed bandits and terrorists to cause problems cross the country.
“I will refrain from being specific on some of the plots that have been uncovered, though the security agencies will spare no efforts in dealing appropriately with any act that can destabilise the nation.
“In this regard, we owe Nigerians the duty to protect and preserve their lives and property regardless of our individual or group aspirations.
“I wish to restate that our doors are always open to collaborate and act proactively to maintain the sanctity of Nigeria.”
He reassured that the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and security agencies are fully prepared for the elections and ready to cooperate and partner with the governors on security.
