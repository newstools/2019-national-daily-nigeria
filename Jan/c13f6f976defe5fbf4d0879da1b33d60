Nice midfielder and Nantes striker not joining Premier League side

Cardiff City will not be signing Adrien Tameze or Emiliano Sala this month after break downs in negotiations, Sky Sports reports.

The Premier League side had been in talks with Nice for defensive midfielder Tameze, while manager Neil Warnock travelled to Nantes to discuss the possibility of signing Argentine striker Sala.

However, negotiations with both clubs have broken down, with Tameze certain to stay with Nice. The deal for Sala is not completely dead just yet, but it is increasingly unlikely to go through.
