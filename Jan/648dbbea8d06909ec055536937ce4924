The former National Chairman that led the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the disastrous defeat in the 2015 general elections, Adamu Muazu, has defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress, (APC).
National Daily gathered that the State PDP Publicity Secretary in Bauchi, Yayanuwa Zainabari, confirmed the defection of Mu’azu to APC. “Honestly, we have confirmed the exit of the former national chairman, deputy national chairman and other two. It’s a big shock to the PDP. However, the party remains strong to sweep the election owing to APC’s failures,” Zainabari had said.
It was confirmed that “former PDP national chairman, Alhaji Adamu Mu’azu, former deputy national chairman North, Alhaji Babayo Garba Gamawa, a former secretary to the federal government, Alhaji Ahmed Yayale, and Alhaji Kaulaha Aliyu, have all defected to the All Progressives Congress.”
The State PDP Publicity Secretary was said to have alleged that the defectors took the decision to dump the PDP so as to escape being investigated for alleged corruption by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), indicating that they rushed to APC for corruption protection.
The former PDP Deputy National Chairman (North), Garnawa Babayo, was said to have concluded his defection to a day after he was suspended for “dereliction of duty and anti-party activity.”
