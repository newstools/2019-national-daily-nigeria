Manchester City are set to make a shock loan offer for Schalke’s Sebastian Rudy, claims the Sun.

Pep Guardiola, who saw the midfielder in action in the Bundesliga during his time in charge at Bayern Munich, sees Rudy as perfect cover for Fernandinho in the engine room.

West Ham United are set to continue negotiations with Celta this week over striker Maxi Gomez, according to the Daily Mail.

Gomez, 22, is seen as the perfect replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who was left out of the Hammers squad this weekend amid rumours he will be leaving the club.

But the Uruguayan will not be allowed to leave unless West Ham get close to his buyout clause of £44 million ($56m).
