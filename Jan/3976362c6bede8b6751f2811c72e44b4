The Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU), on Wednesday, January 16, announced that it will go on another round of strike in two weeks’ time, if the issues that led to the May, 2018 industrial action are not resolved by the federal government.
In a letter addressed to Chris Ngige, the minister of labour and employment, the health union, through its chairman, Biobelemoye Josiah, issued the strike notice.
“In view of the apparent indifference of government to permanently resolve these lingering issues, some of which have persisted for over five years now, the Joint Health Sector Unions by this letter notifies the Federal Government of her resolve to resume the suspended industrial action by Thursday, 31st January, 2019.
“Having waited for this long it is surprising that the following matters have not been resolved,” Josiah said in the letter.
Josiah said revealed that some of the unresolved issues are upward review of the Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS), unjustified delay of the salaries of JOHESU members for the months of April and May, 2018 and headship of hospital departments.
Other matters are non-promotion of members on CONHESS 14 – 15 as directors in some federal health institutions, and implementation of consultancy cadre to JOHESU staff.
Concerning the union’s position on the looming strike, the national vice chairman of JOHESU, Ogbonna Chimela said: “Yes, we will embark on strike two weeks from now. All our agreements with the government are yet to be met.”
