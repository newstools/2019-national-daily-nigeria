The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), on Wednesday, leaked the order from the federal government to the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to freeze the bank accounts of the embattled Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), and accordingly, raised alarm over the safety of CJN Onnoghen.
The CUPP had on Wednesday declared that it had uncovered a plot by the federal government to freeze the CJN’s bank accounts as well as confiscate other family assets through a letter from the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to the Director ofNigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU).
Ikenga Ugochinyere, CUPP’s spokesperson, in a statement on Wednesday, indicated that the coalition lamented that the current ordeal of the CJN will not end soon, adding that he is up against forces who are ;desperate and who do not care if the engine of state grinds to a halt.
The CUPP disclosed that it was in possession of a letter from the AGF to freeze Onnoghen’s accounts as well as seize his assets; it decried that the APC had taken the attack to a new low by moving to confiscate the family assets of the CJN.
It noted that Nigerians would be shocked by the contents of the letter directing the freezing of the accounts and assets of the CJN.
