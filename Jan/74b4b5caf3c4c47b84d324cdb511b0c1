The Nigerian government prosecutor in the trial of Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen said on the federal government has written the CJN to resign.
In his opening address at the resumed hearing in the matter, Aliu Umar, said  Onnoghen had been written a notice, but he could not tell whether the jurist had received it or not.
Onnoghen was not present when the tribunal opened at 10:21 a.mm the second day of the hearing which began January 14.
The CJN was alleged to have failed to declare his bank accounts despite being a Supreme Court judge since 2005, an offence that contracts the Code of Conduct Act and could see draw penalties if established.
Wole Olanipekun, a senior lawyer leading a team of over 50 defence counsels for Mr Onnoghen.
The SAN said his client was absent because of the cases that were instituted against the tribunal’s proceeding.
A federal high court ruled last week that Onnoghen’s trial be suspended, but government supporters have argued that the ruling was an anomaly because the tribunal has parallel powers as federal high courts.
They argued that only the Court of Appeal could issue rulings that would be binding on the tribunal.
The Court of Appeal fixed January 24 for hearing on the matter.
