Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar transmitting his Easter message
to Nigerians highlighted the significance of the festival which he
identified to include dying for imperfection and resurrection to
perfection. Translating the belief to the Nigerian situation, the
Waziri Adamawa reflected on the hope for dying to leadership
challenges, poverty, hunger, violence, and resurrecting to potentials,
prosperity, unity and safety.
Atiku in a statement on Thursday he personally signed, highlighted:
“Easter is a time of resurrection. Of dying to what was imperfect and
reawakening to what is perfect. This is the message of hope which this
season is all about.
“Nigeria is going through difficult times. But Easter gives us hope
that, as a nation, we will die to challenges and live to our
potentials. We will die to extreme poverty and live to extra and
prosperity. We will die to strife and be united in life.
‘Even as we celebrate, I urge all Nigerians to remember the men and
women of our armed forces, who are even right now in ditches and
trenches in order to keep us safe. Let us also spare a thought to
those who have suffered at the hands of terrorists, marauders and
criminals.

“A new Nigeria is being birthed; a Nigeria of possibilities instead of
impossibilities.

“Suffice to say that Jesus Christ (Nabi Isa) is a compassionate friend
to all who are weary and heavy laden, and as we celebrate His
resurrection, let us also remember the less privileged in our midst.
“Let us also thank God for the fact that we remain as one nation under
God. Where there is unity, there is much hope. Much hope indeed.
“It is with this in mind that I wish the body of Christ and all
Nigerians a happy Easter. May God bless us all and may God bless
Nigeria.”
