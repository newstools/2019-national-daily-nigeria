The ruling military council has responded to the continuous protest in Sudan after the removal of President Omar al-Bashir, promising to hold talks on the formation of a new civilian government. However, protesters demand immediate end to military rule.
Apparently, the Military Council in Sudan on Friday pledged to hold talks with all political groups in the country on forming a civilian government, saying it has no “ambitions to hold the reins of power” after President Omar al-Bashir’s removal.
The proposal made on Friday was immediately rejected by the Sudanese Professional’s Association (SPA), which spear-headed the months-long protests that triggered al-Bashir’s overthrow.
Omar Zein al-Abideen, a member of the transitional military council, which is now running Sudan under General Awad Ibn Auf,  said the Council was “ready to step down as early as a month if a government is formed”.
Speaking in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, al-Abideen said the solutions to Sudan’s crisis would come from the protesters.
“We are the protectors of the demands of the people,” he said; adding, “We are not greedy for power.”
“We will not dictate anything to the people. We want to create an atmosphere to manage a peaceful dialogue.
“Today, we will hold a dialogue with the political entities to prepare a climate for dialogue,” al-Abideen maintained.
Al-Bashir’s National Congress Party was not invited to join the talks because “it is responsible for what happened”, he said, adding that the council expects the pre-election transition period it announced on Thursday to last two years at most or much less if chaos can be avoided.
