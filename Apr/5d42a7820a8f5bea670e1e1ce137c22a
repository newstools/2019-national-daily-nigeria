Nigerian Senate on Thursday frowned at the inability of the Federal Government to secure the release of Leah Sharibu, the only Dapchi, Yobe State school girl still in Boko Haram captivity.

The lawmakers have therefore asked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to put every necessary effort to secure the release of Leah Sharibu from the North East of Nigeria terrorist group.

The call is coming more than one year after Miss Sharibu was kidnapped along 111 other school girls on February 19, 2018, from her school, Government Girls Science and Technical Secondary School in Dapchi, Yobe State.

The Federal Government had opened negotiations with the terrorist group which led to the release of other girls. However, the insurgent group were said to have refused to free Leah Sharibu because she refused to denounce her Christian faith for freedom.

During Senate plenary on Thursday, the senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, has raised Leah Sharibuâ€™s matter in his Point of Order, drawing the attention of the Federal government to Boko Haram continuous keeping of Leah Sharibu in captivity.

He then sought for urgent legislative intervention to bring her back home.

Sani further asked that the Federal Government also ensure the release of the remaining Chibok girls, who were kidnapped in February 2014 and are still in Boko Haram captivity.
