The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa State filing a petition
at the Governorship Election Tribunal demanded the cancellation of the
result of the governorship election in the state won by the candidate
of the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP), Ahmadu Fintiri. The Governor
of the state and APC candidate, Jibrilla Bindow, was defeated in the
election.
On submission of the petition at the Tribunal, APC state Organizing
Secretary in Adamawa, Ahmed Lawal, acknowledged that the party has
formally lodged its protest, seeking justice to ensure the will of the
people prevail.

Lawal was said to have emphasized that the party is asking the
tribunal to declare APC as the winner of the March 9 and 23, 2019
governorship elections in the state, or annul the result for another
governorship election to be conducted.
The APC State Organising Secretary had argued that election in 11
local government areas was marred by irregularities, ranging from over
voting, to non-use of smart card readers and violence. Lawal was said
to have alleged that some of the party’s supporters were intimidated
and disenfranchised during the voting.
The State Organising Secretary had noted that though Governor Bindow
declined to seek redress, the state party leadership decided to take
action and petition the tribunal.
He expressed confidence in the impartiality of the Tribunal, insisting
that APC will get justice with the evidence at the party’s disposal.
