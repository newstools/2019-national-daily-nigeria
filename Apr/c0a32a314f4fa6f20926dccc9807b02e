The Federal Government have inaugurated the construction of nine 330 KV transmission lines with the capacity to deliver additional 624 Megawatts of electricity to the Federal Capital Territory and environs.
At a ceremony held in Dawaki, Abuja, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Power, Dr Louis Edozien, charged the Managing Director, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company, Mr Ernest Mupwaya, and generation companies to ensure effective use of the facility at completion in two years.
Edozien said, “It is the distribution company that must play the role in taking this extra capacity and delivering it to customers.
“At the same time, the partnership also expects the generation companies to produce power because if they don’t produce another 624mw, it is only the engineers that will at the end of two years admire the facility.”
Edozien said it was time for the DISCOs to consider a more purposeful and successful financing intervention for the distribution and the retail end of the electricity chain.
Speaking at the ceremony, the Managing Director of Transmission Company of the Nigeria, Mr Usman Mohammed, said that the purpose of the project was to address the challenge of transmission in the Federal Capital Territory.
Mohammed said that the company saved about N25m from the procurement process, adding that the contractors were ready to mobilise for construction before payment.
