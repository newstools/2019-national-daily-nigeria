The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON)  has commended the effort of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for unraveling the drug trafficking circle of criminals notorious for planting drugs in innocent travelers’ luggage.
 
It said the two agencies will continue to work together to ensure a drug-incident-free Umrah season and Hajj 2019 period.
 
The discovery gives hope for the redemption of Zainab Habibu Aliyu from incarceration, the young lady who pleaded ignorance of baggage tagged in her name.

Consequently, the Commission has ordered its lawyers in Saudi Arabia to complement efforts of the Nigerian mission in the Kingdom in securing Zainab’s timely release back to the country.
 
The Commission says it will collaborate with sister agencies, to deploy the necessary staff and technology at Hajj departure centers nationwide to ensure the security of pilgrims and their luggage against abuse and drug peddling in any guise.
