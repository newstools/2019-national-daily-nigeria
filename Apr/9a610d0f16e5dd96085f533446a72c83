United Nations (UN) and the international community have been urged to compel President Muhammadu Buhari to allow the secession of people who are fighting for Biafra Republic.
The call was made by ex-Niger Delta militants under the aegis of Niger Delta Ken Saro Wiwa Adaka Boro Biafra Freedom Fighters.
The leader of the group, Jasper Emmanuel, made the call in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, saying that agitation for Biafra will only end when Nigerian government allows the old eastern region have their own country.
“All ex-agitators and militants must come together to support and agitate for the actualisation of Biafra Republic as that would give the Niger Delta region the tonic for rapid socio-economic development which had eluded the region for decades.
“We are seriously working with all necessary stakeholders and Biafra agitation groups within and outside the country to actualise the dream of the Biafra Republic where the people can be free in a country they can call their own.
“The actualisation of Biafra Republic will happen shortly as the people can no longer remain in a federation that is politically and economically favourable to only some sections, while other parts of the country that lay the golden egg live in abject poverty and under development.
“The battle for the actualisation of a sovereign state of Biafra must be fought and won on all fronts for the benefit of all as the political imbalance of Nigeria has thrown under development to some sections while political power had remained the exclusive preserve of a few ethnic and religious groups,” Emmanuel said.
