The crisis in the ruling All Progressives Congress has continued to deepen even after the 2019 general elections. The APC National Working Committee (NWC) has issue a query to the Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, over alleged anti-party activities.
Lanre Isa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary, in a statement after the NWC meeting presided by APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, expressed that the governor’s anti-party activities “greatly affected the fortunes of its candidates in the recently conducted presidential and National Assembly elections in the state.”
Isa-Onilu, on Monday, confirmed that the query had been sent to Akeredolu based on the directive of the NWC.
“Yes, it has been done. The query has been sent to him according to the NWC’s resolution,” he said.
“It is not to my knowledge whether he has replied the query. You know that it is not my department that handles that particular assignment.
“I am not the one to receive his reply if he has done so. But I know that a query has been dispatched to him,” he declared.
APC National Working Committee had on March 1 resolved to issue a query to the Ondo State governor over glaring anti-party activities; after the party NWC had suspended Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State and Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State after fidnign them guilty of anti-party activities.
