National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has reiterated its commitment toward supporting Information Communication Technology (ICT) start-ups for the development of technology ecosystem in the country.
Dr Amina Sambo-Magaji, national coordinator, Office for ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OIIE), a subsidiary of NITDA, said this in an interview with journalists.
Consolidating on ICT projects of NITDA, Sambo- Magaji said the agency would further support technology entrepreneurs through its StartUp Friday (SUF) programme, a technology entrepreneurs’ gathering that is due for takeoff in Kano on Friday.
She said that the SUF, being the 11th edition in a series, would ensure that ICT startups within the region were encouraged and supported by government.
Sambo-Magaji said that the SUF was part of the agency’s activities aimed at developing the technology ecosystem across the six geopolitical regions in the country.
She added that “SUF is not basically for the host state alone but for a whole region.
 
“SUF is designed to be driven by and for building the state ecosystem, while NITDA acts as facilitator. SUF is not for the host state but the entire region.’’
“Also, 10 best startups who registered for the event within the region would be given the opportunity to pitch and grants given to them to grow their enterprise.
“Furthermore, the startups are included in NITDA’s database and are further supported with mentoring, workspace vouchers at hubs, entrepreneurial training, matching them up with relevant government institutions for access to market and other support.’’
The coordinator said that the agency would on April 26, hold the 12th edition of SUF in Enugu.
She explained that the office’s programmes include: StartUp Clinics, FurtureHack, a hackathon series hosted in academic institutions, enabling policies, promoting access to technology infrastructure and commercialising technology research, services and products.
