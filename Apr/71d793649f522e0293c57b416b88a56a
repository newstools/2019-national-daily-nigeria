The Kwara State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal commenced sitting towards the end of the week to hear petitions against the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who was declared winner of the poll by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state. The tribunal at its inaugural sitting ordered that the APC and the governor-elect, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, be served the petitions against them through substituted means to avoid unnecessary delay of proceedings arising from inability to serve notice of the petitions on the defendants.
The tribunal received petitions from the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), including the Action Alliance challenging the victory of the APC governorship candidate, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, in the March 16 governorship election in Kwara State.
Further proceedings will resume next week.
