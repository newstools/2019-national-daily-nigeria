Another renovation that is close to being confirmed in Paris. Dani Alves will remain a Paris Saint-Germain player next season. Representatives of the Brazilian side and the directors of the Parisian club have arrived, apparently, to a principle of agreement that should continue to be defined throughout this week.
Near the age of 36, Dani Alves had requested two years of contract to extend a bond that ends this June. In principle, the position of the club was to renew a year, an option that a few weeks ago could not come to fruition to receive the refusal of the Brazilian.

After several meetings, both parties would have accepted a year of contract with the possibility of expanding to another season depending on the level that shows Alves and with a condition of a number of matches played.
While the PSG has shown a different policy regarding the signings in search of younger players, it confirms the presence of the season that comes from one of the most veteran players in the squad.
