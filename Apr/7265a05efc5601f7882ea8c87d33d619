Senator Ben Bruce, representing Bayelsa East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, on Sunday, noted why President Muhammadu Buhari should redirect his attention towards education than dissipate all energy in the fight against corruption.
Senator Bruce on his Twitter on Sunday noted that those who open the doors of schools shut the gates of prisons.
T h Senator stated: “Dear President @MBuhari, Invest in education, not just in anti-corruption.
“Instead of throwing people in jail, remember that he who opens the doors of a school closes the doors of prisons.
“It is sad that you have built not ONE school. Not even one. Yet you want crime to end.”
Senator Bruce complained about children of school age who abandon school in search of menial jobs, in addition to the growing rate of unemployment in Nigeria.
“If we don’t create the right atmosphere for KIDS who leave school to get jobs, why then should we be surprised when they engage in KIDNAPPING? This is a matter of cause and effect. People don’t kidnap because they are evil. Kidnapping is a poverty-induced crime. Solve poverty,” Bruce said.
He recommended the “Bayelsa educational model” to the Muhammadu Buhari administration.
“Don’t be too proud to learn from Governor @iamHSDickson. The best way to fight terrorism in the Northeast, banditry in the Northwest and kidnapping nationwide is to build schools,” Bruce said.
Senator Bruce postulated that as unemployment reduces, crime also reduces.
Senator Bruce said: “Crime is just absence of employment and presence of mischief. Just like shadows disappear at the presence of light, so does crime disappear at the presence of employment. Educate and provide employment in Nigeria, and you reduce crime.”
