He said examination officials are allowed to scrutinise eye glasses or similar devices and when convinced that such items may compromise the sanctity of the examination, the examination official should confiscate them.
”We urge candidates to abide by the rules and regulations of the board. Candidates should not come with any of the prohibited items,” he said.
