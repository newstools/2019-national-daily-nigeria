The Nigerian Senate has drawn a beetle line with President Muhammadu Buhari over his perennial dissent to several bills passed by the National Assembly. The Senate at plenary on Wednesday accepted the report of its technical committee which examined the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to decline assent to some bills.
The acceptance of the report indicated that the Senate may move to override the President’s veto.
The committee in its recommendation noted that there is no reason for President Buhari to decline assent to the bills.
The bills are, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (fourth alteration, no.28) bill, 2018 and the Industrial Development Income Tax Relief) amendment bill, 2018.
Four bills were recommended to be withdrawn while 11 others are to be reconsidered by the Senate.
The Senate requires two-thirds of the 109 lawmakers to override the President’s veto. However, party politics who dominates the behaviours of the lawmakers and the worship of a political idol in President Buhari by APC lawmakers may make the senate in cohesive in the effort to assert the sanctity of the legislature.
Several other bills were rejected by the president which he did not modify for re-representation to the National Assembly for legislation. The passed bills were, therefore, killed on the table of the president.
