Tottenham plan to hold talks over a new contract with influential playmaker Christian Eriksen at the end of the season.
Eriksen, whose current deal is due to expire in 2020, has held off signing an extension like his team-mates as he considers his future.
The Dane scored an 88th-minute winner against Brighton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday night, once again showcasing his importance.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino is keen to keep hold of Eriksen and talks will be held once the season is over when Spurs will know if they have qualified for the Champions League or not.
‘Of course I hope and I wish that Christian can be with us in the future,’ Pochettino said in his post-match press conference.
‘I think Christian and us, we are so open to talk and we will see what happens.
‘I think it’s so close, the end of the season. There is a lot of time to talk after.
‘The most important now is not only for him but for all the players to be focused and try to achieve the thing that we want.’
