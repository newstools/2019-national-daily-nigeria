Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), has waved aside claims made by the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) that he is plotting with Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, to annul the result of the Rivers State governorship election.
In a statement by his spokesman Salihu Isah, he described the statement as ridiculous, and warned that the he should not be linked with politics in Rivers State.
He said: “I am not aware of any such ridiculous plan. There is nothing like that, to my knowledge. We are in a democracy, and there are institutions with powers to void elections if the need arises. That is not part of the responsibilities of the Attorney-General of the Federation.
“So, they should not link him with such ridiculous claims. They should leave the AGF out of the local politics in Rivers State. There are better and more important issues to attract the attention of the minister.”
The PDP had accused Rotimi Amaechi and Abubakar Malami of conspiring to void the March 9 Rivers State governorship election.
The PDP through its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiya, on Sunday, said it had been informed of how desperate figures of the All Progressive congress (APC) and their agents had been mounting pressure on the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Mohammed, to reverse the February 12, 2019 final judgment of the Supreme Court.
