The Sudanese military has resisted pressure to extradite the ousted President to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for prosecution on war crimes. Apparently, the ousted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan who is on the wanted list of the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and war crimes, will not be extradited, the country’s new military rulers declared on Friday.
“The president is currently in custody,” the head of the military council’s political committee, Lieutenant General Omar Zain al-Abdin, said at a news conference.
 “We as a military council, we will not deliver the president abroad during our period” in office”, Abdin said when asked about the ICC arrest warrant.
The ICC had issued warrant of arrest on President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan while he was in office. All efforts to arrest the Sudanese president at international multilateral and bilateral fora failed over the years. ICC has not given up on the former President of Sudan.
