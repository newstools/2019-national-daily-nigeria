Nigerian Air Force Special Forces operating in Zamfara State have prevented bandits from invading Hayin Mahe and Hayin Kanawa villages in Gusau Local Government Area.
The Forces moved in after receiving intelligence reports that the bandits, who operate from Sububu and Kagara forests, had struck in some villages and kidnapped many inhabitants of the communities. The security operatives engaged the bandits in exchange of gunfire, leading to the death of five bandits while several others sustained varying degrees of injuries, and many others fled into the forest.
Three Ak-47 rifles with magazines were recovered from the bandits. The security operatives rescue some inhabitants of the communities who were kidnapped by the bandits, including two women and a child. The rescued persons were handed over to the district head of Mada town.
An alpha jet and attack helicopters traced the fleeing bandits, located and destroyed their hideouts in Sububu Forest.
Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, Spokesman of the Nigerian Air Force, in a statement, maintained that the Air Force, working in close coordination with other security agencies, will sustain its operations to neutralize the armed bandits and deny them freedom of action in the area.
