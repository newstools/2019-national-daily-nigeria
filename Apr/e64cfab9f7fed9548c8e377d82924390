The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State, Great Ogboru, has suffered fresh setback in his bid to reclaim the governorship election victory in the state. A Federal High Court in a judgment by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba nullified the disputed governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State from where Great Ogboru emerged candidate for the 2019 governorship election.
The Plaintiff, Rt. Hon Victor Ochei, through his lawyer Ahmed Raji, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), in suit no FHC/ABJ/CS/1085/2018, filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, presided by Dimgba, before he was transferred to Asaba, granted all but one of the prayers of the Plaintiff and declared the APC’s gubernatorial primary election held on Sunday, September 30, 2018 illegal and unlawful on the ground that delegates unknown to the law were used for the exercise.
“All the reliefs sought in this suit are similar with those for which Justice Tosin Adegoke pronounced judgement on, so reliefs 1, 2, 3, 5 are granted, but relief 4 is refused, because the governorship election is over and the relief is spent,” Justice Dimgba ruled.
The candidacy of Ogboru has earlier been annulled by a high court before the last judgment. Ogboru is currently challenging the victory of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa at the tribunal.
