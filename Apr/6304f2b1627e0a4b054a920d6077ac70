After exiting this year’s CAF Confederation Cup at the group stage, Enugu Rangers have said they remain confident they will play international football again next year going by their fine run in the NPFL, National Daily learnt.
Rangers coach Gbenga Ogunbote disclosed that the top target is for the team to play again on the continent in the coming year.
“We continue to fight and play our game with the hope of getting more points on the road and ensure we qualify for the end of the season super-six for us to navigate back to the continent,” Ogunbote declared after his team pipped visiting Katsina United 1-0 Sunday.
“It was a very tough encounter against a quality side that came here to seek for a revenge. It would have been better for us but for the several missed opportunities we had.
“Our target is to get back to the continent where we rightly belong,” added striker Godwin Zaki.
With Sunday’s home victory, Rangers moved up the NPFL Group A table to second behind MFM FC.
They have 21 points, two points behind the table toppers who lost to Kwara United 1-0 and have played four more matches than the ‘Flying Antelopes’.
