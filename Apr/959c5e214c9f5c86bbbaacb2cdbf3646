The Court of Appeal sitting on Abuja has fixed Wednesday to hear the appeal of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun state challenging the tribunal ruling that nullified the September 2018 election that brought him in.
 
On March 22, 2019, the chairman of the tribunal, Justice Ibrahim Sirajo, in a minority judgement declared the candidate of the Senator Ademola Adeleke the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) as the governor of the state.

He went ahead to nullify the certificate of return issued to Oyetola and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to issue a fresh one to Adeleke.
 
But Oyetola, in his 39-ground notice of appeal filed on March 26, 2019, asked the court to nullify the minority judgement.
 
Oyetola, through his lead counsel, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), asked the Court of Appeal to uphold his appeal, and not only set aside the tribunal’s majority judgment but to also dismiss the October 16, 2018 petition by the PDP and Adeleke.
 
It was learnt on Monday that April 24 had been fixed by the Court of Appeal for the hearing of the appeal challenging the tribunal’s judgment.
