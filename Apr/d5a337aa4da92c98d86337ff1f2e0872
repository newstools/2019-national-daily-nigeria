Sudanese military authorities have announced a two-year military rule following the overthrow of President Omar Al-Bashir  on Thursday.
Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, who led the putsch , said the constitution has been suspended and the military will now be in charge of the country for  two years.
He also imposed a three-month state of emergency as protesters demand immediate commencement of democratic transition.
“I announce as minister of defence the toppling of the regime and detaining its chief in a secure place,” Mr Ibn Auf said in a televised address Thursday at about 2:00 p.m. local time. He will lead the newly-inaugurated supreme military council.
Sudan’s airspace would be shut for 24 hours, while border crossings would be closed indefinitely.
The country descended into an upheaval following massive protests across the country for five days.
While the citizens praised the military for responding by toppling Al-Bashir and his 30-year rule, they worry over the suspension of the constitution and the two-year military rule..
They vowed to continue the protest in spite of the curfew and other emergency measures the military announced.
All the political prisoners the former government held were released on Thursday.
