A former Vice-President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Monday Ubani, has regained his freedom after being detained for 24 days by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
The EFCC detained Ubani along with Senator Christopher Enai, with whom he stood as surety for a former Managing Director of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, Mrs Ngozi Olejeme, whom the EFCC accused of N6.4bn fraud.
The EFCC on March 19 invited and detained Ubani and Enai because Olojeme allegedly absconded.
The two men, through Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), challenged their detention by the EFCC before the Federal Capital Territory High Court in Apo, Abuja.
In his judgment on March 26, Justice Silvanus Oriji ordered the EFCC to either charge the men to court immediately or release them on bail on or before March 28.
However, many days after the judgment, the EFCC neither released the men on bail nor charged them to court, prompting Ozekhome to commence contempt proceedings against the EFCC acting Chairman, Ibrahim Magu.
The refusal of the EFCC to comply with the court order drew criticisms from various quarters, including the NBA and a human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN).
A senior EFCC official confirmed Ubaniâ€™s release on Thursday.
Efforts to speak to Ubani about the terms of his release were unproductive as his mobile phone was switched off.
Already, the Commission has filed three charges against him for failing to produce Olejeme.
