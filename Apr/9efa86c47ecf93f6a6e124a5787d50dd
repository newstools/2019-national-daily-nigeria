About four students of Federal University of Technology (FUTO) Owerri, Imo State, were on Thursday confirmed after allegedly consuming large dosage of sex enhancement drug, alcohol and hard drugs.
A source from the institution was gathered to have revealed on Thursday that the tragedy occurred on Tuesday at Sunshine Hostel, Umuchima in Ihiagwa, Owerri West council area of the State.
The source had narrated that three of the victims were found dead while the fourth victim was unconscious and had to be rushed to an undisclosed private hospital where he later died.
It was further gathered that the four victims, three males and one female were found naked surrounded by some leftover of the substances they had absorbed.
Witnesses in the Neighborhood had narrated that the deceased were disturbing all through the night with loud music coming from the room where the bodies were discovered in the morning, though, never knew a tragedy of that magnitude had occurred.
The corpses were later that afternoon evacuated by the police to an undisclosed hospital while arrests were said to have been made as investigations continue.
The incident led to the desertion of the Sunshine Hostel and other neighbouring hostels by customers, while residents have gone into hiding to avoid police arrest.
Some FUTO students expressed shock, condemned the rising incidence of drug induced fatalities among the student population.
They blamed the recurring cult war at the Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri, and other institutions within the city for the rampant abuse of hard drugs and other psychotic substances.
