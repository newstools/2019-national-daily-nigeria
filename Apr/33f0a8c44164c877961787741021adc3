Justice Walter Onnoghen, the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), after calling his first witness, closed his defence at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) where he being prosecuted for non-declaration of assets and operation of domiciliary accounts. Justice Onnoghen was coerced to commence his defence on April 1, 2019, after the CCT Chairman rejected the request of Onnoghen’s lead Counsel,  Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN), to allow him time to prepare his defence on Friday.
The Tribunal had adjourned sitting on Monday to Wednesday, to allow the appearance of the CJN witness to arrive Abuja from Benin City, Edo State. On resumption of sitting the CJN called his first witness, Olarewaju Basuri, his driver.
The Tribunal also granted leave to the suspended CJN to subpeona, a Director at the CCB in Benin, who was to appear before the Tribunal as the defendant’s witness.
At the resumed trial, Counsel to the defendant, Chris Uche, notified the Tribunal that the defendant has come to a conclusion to close his case.
This is in pursuant to paragraph 14 of the practice direction of the CCT.
There are indications that the trial will come to a close on April 15, 2019, when Onnoghen will know his faith.
