The security collapse in the northwest Nigeria has continued to cause nightmares for inhabitants of local communities in Zamfara State. The bandits are making successful economic fortunes through violence in communities in the northern states where kidnapping and robbery have become writ large.
The bandits had on Sunday evening kidnapped brothers, Yusuf and Abba Lawal, in Gusau, Zamfara State, who were taken to unknown destinations. The elder brother of the victims, Musa Lawal, has launched an appeal to the federal government for the rescue of the victims, urging the government to investigate the rampant kidnappings and armed banditry activities in Zamfara State.
Musa Lawal narrated that they just returned from a wedding in Kaduna that evening when his two younger brothers were kidnapped in the house by suspected bandits.
Yusuf Lawal, one of the kidnapped persons, is a staff of First Bank of Nigeria in Kaduna.
