Even with their charms and guns, two kidnappers cum robbers lost their lives in a shootout with operatives of the SARS at the Hospital Junction, Imo, on Saturday.
One of the criminals shot dead, Martins Nwoke, was a dismissed sergeant who just served a jailed term for a similar offence.
Nwoke and his partner in crime had gone to the area to sell a vehicle they snatched from one of their victims.
On sighting the SARS operatives and their commander Godfrey Victor, who came on a tip-off, the two-man gang began to shoot.
“The two suspects fell to the superior firepower of the police,” a police source said.
An ash coloured Toyota Camry with number plate, LSD 857 FR, suspected to have been robbed from a kidnap victim, was recovered.
Other items recovered were one locally-made pistol, two expended and one live cartridge, and charms of various types. It is important to note that these two deceased suspects had been on our wanted list in cases of kidnapping and armed robberies.
“The dead suspects came into Imo State trying to sell the car at a give-away price. Our men closed in on them and immediately they saw us, they opened fire on us; but we overpowered them.”
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu confirmed the incident, adding the state Commissioner of Police, Rabiu Ladodo, had ordered that every member of the gang be apprehended.
