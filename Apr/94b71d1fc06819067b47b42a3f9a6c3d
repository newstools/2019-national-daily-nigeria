While the Federal Government is still protesting the execution of a Nigerian, Kudirat Afolabi, in Saudi Arabia for drug-related offences, another Nigerian, Saheed Ayinde Sobade, has been nabbed by the Saudi authorities while ferrying over 1,000 grams of cocaine in Jeddah.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, lamented that it is becoming clear that the hangman is already on standby to perform another duty on a second Nigerian in Saudi Arabia.
The federal government had on Thursday condemned the execution of Afolabi, a widow and mother of two, who was killed on April 1.
Dabiri-Arewa noted that the Saudi authorities have never spared any country when dealing with issues relating to drugs, she acknowledged that Nigeria only advocates for fair trial, but that the Saudi government does not tolerate drug trafficking for any reason. Offences of drug trafficking are punished with outright death penalties.
