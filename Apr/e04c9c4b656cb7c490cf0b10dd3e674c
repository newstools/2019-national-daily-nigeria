It was learnt that the time frame for the resignation would afford the state finance ministry adequate time to compute severance payments and reconcile any liabilities.

The directive from the governor shows that each notice of resignation must be submitted along with a handover note signed by the political appointee on behalf of the portfolio he held.

The directive adds that all the resignation letters should be properly addressed to the governor’s principal private secretary.
