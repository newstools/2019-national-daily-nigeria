Senator representing Kaduna Central at the Senate, Shehu Sani has described the gruesome murder of a British national identified as Ms Faye Mooney by suspected kidnappers during the recent attack on Kajuru, Kaduna State as reflection of Nigeria’s tragedy.

The death of Mooney (an expatriate) who was among the two people killed and three kidnapped on April 19 at a recreational resort in Kajuru Local Government Area of the state has brought Nigeria’s worsening insecurity issues.

The victims were said to have travelled from Lagos to have some fun at the resort when they were attacked around 11pm.

Mooney, who worked with a non-governmental organisation, Mercy Corps, was killed alongside Mathew Oguche, a staff member of an international NGO, Safety Organisation.

In a tweet posted on his time-line on Monday, Sani said the kidnap and killing of Mooney was a reflection of our tragedy.

He wrote: “Ms Faye Mooney felled to the Kidnappers bullet but factually felled by our failings. She was not a victim but a martyr & a hero who believed in us and walked into our mines with flowers and with love.

“She was a reflection of our tragedy, our perils and the bitter truth about our present.”

The British High Commission in a statement by the Head of Communications, Policy and Corporate Lead, Department for International Development, David Smith, in Abuja on Sunday, explained that the deceased Briton’s next-of-kin had been notified.

The commission stated that it was offering consular assistance to her family while also engaging with the Nigerian authorities on the incident.
