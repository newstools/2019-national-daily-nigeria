The war between Naira Marley and Simi seems to be getting hotter by the day. Trouble started after Simi took to social media to warn Yahoo Yahoo boys against buying her songs as she does not in any way support their acts. Her statement got singer Naira Marley all riled up, taking to his IG page to share his thoughts about this and saying he is in fact in support of the fraudulent act as he does not see it as a crime. His controversial statement, of course, got many talking which resulted in backlash for him but this does not seem to bother the Issagoal singer who has again taken to social media to blast Simi.

This time, Marley dragged her marriage into the whole mix saying Simi snubbed him when they met. Watch the video below;
