Nigerian airline operator, Dana Air, has disclosed it will be taking delivery of three Boeing-737 in 2019 as it increases the company’s fleet for operation and intensifies expansion of its routes.

According to findings, one Boeing 737 will arrive Nigeria in the second quarter of 2019, while the other two would be added to the fleet before the end of the year.

While it was not specified if the Boeing 737 aircraft is the controversial Max models, Dana Air is the second domestic airline operator that is waiting to take delivery of a Boeing aircraft. Air Peace had also in 2018 ordered for planes from the plane maker.

Note that as at the time Air Peace ordered the Boeing 737-Max model, the aircraft was the cynosure of airline operators around the world. But within the space of five months, the beloved aircraft became infamous after two deadly accidents.

The aircraft was banned by over fifty countries after an Ethiopian Airways flight crashed, killing all 157 passengers. According to a preliminary investigation into the accident, the Pilots of both airlines struggled with MCAS, a Boeing software which caused the planes to nosedive.
Following the Ethiopian Airways accident, media reports about Air Peace ordering the same plane-type went viral. The domestic airline’s customers even demanded that the order be cancelled.

However, Air Peace said it’s too early to make such decision, informing their customers and the public that it intends to wait for full investigation of both crashes.

Now with Dana Air looking to increase its fleet with Boeing 737 planes without clarity on the model-type, this might compound the fears of air travellers in the country.

Recall that the Nigerian Government had earlier warned that no Boeing 737-Max 8 jets will be allowed in the country’s airspace. Boeing also supported action to temporarily ground 737 MAX Operations after consultation.
