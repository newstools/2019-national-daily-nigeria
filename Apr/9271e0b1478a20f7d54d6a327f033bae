Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, has concluded a three-week attachment with the country’s security and intelligence agencies MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, his office said on Sunday.
William started his assignment at the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, followed by a week at security service MI5, ending at GCHQ, which gathers communications from around the world to identify and disrupt threats to Britain.
“Spending time inside our security and intelligence agencies, understanding more about the vital contribution they make to our national security, was a truly humbling experience,” said William.
The young prince has been satisfying his youthful curiosity by taking on adventurous activities with the British security agencies.
After he completed his  degree at the University of St. Andrews,  he spent time in Chile, Belize, and Africa. In December 2006, he completed 44 weeks of training as an officer cadet and was commissioned in the Blues and Royals regiment.
William completed pilot training at Royal Air Force College Cranwell in 2008, then underwent helicopter flight training and became a full-time pilot with the RAF Search and Rescue Force in early 2009.
After his service with the British Armed Forces ended in September 2013, he trained for a civil pilot’s licence and spent over two years working as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance.
