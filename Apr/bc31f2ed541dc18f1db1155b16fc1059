A senior lawyer in Onnoghen’s legal team, who is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), was said to have confirmed the resignation of suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, who sent his letter of exit from service to President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday.
The SAN who though acknowledged not authorized by Onnoghen to speak on the incident, was said to have stated: “I have just spoken with him. He confirmed to me that he resigned voluntarily yesterday (Thursday).”
Onnoghen had voluntarily sent his resignation letter to President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, about 24 hours after the National Judicial Council (NJC) concluded investigation of the allegations against him for various misconduct. The NJC also sent its report to the President. There have been insinuations that the NJC recommended compulsory retirement of Onnoghen by the President.
Also, Onnoghen is being prosecuted at the Code of Conduct Tribunal on six-count charge of non-asset declaration and operation of domiciliary accounts. The Tribunal has fixed April 15 for hearing from both the prosecution and defence counsels, thereafter, judgment follows.
All the traps became inescapable for the embattled CJN, perhaps, compelling him to resign voluntarily with immediate effect.
The approval of the resignation by President Buhari is still being awaited.
