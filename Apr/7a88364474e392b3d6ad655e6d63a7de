A group within the APC has called on the leadership of the party to zone the position of the Speaker, House of Representatives in the Ninth National Assembly to the South-East.
The South East Renaissance Group leader Chris Onyemechara, made the call at a press conference in Abuja pm Thursday.
According to him, the APC denied the South-East principal office positions in the National Assembly in 2015 on the grounds that the zone did not have a ranking member on the platform of the party.
He noted now that the zone had produced two ranking members, the party’s leaders are looking for another excuse.
Onyemechara said a situation where the same geopolitical zone that produced the Vice-President plans to produce the Speaker of the House of Representatives is unacceptable.
He claimed that in spite of all odds, the APC members in the South-East had shown capacity and leadership, and they should be encouraged with such strategic position.
He therefore called on all party members jostling for the position from other geopolitical zones to withdraw from the race and support the South-East.
“Politics of exclusion did not yield much political dividends for our party in the South-East in the last election,” he said.
“Under the circumstance, the best way to start is to zone the Speakership of the House of Representatives to the South-East.
“We therefore call on our party members from other geopolitical zones jostling for the Speakership of the House of Representatives to forthwith withdraw from the race and support the South-East in the spirit of fairness, justice and equity.”
The southwest has been clamouring for the House topmost position to be handed to Majority Leader Femi Gbajabiamila.
Party leader Bola Tinubu said recently it is the APCdecision and the party will take action against anybody that works against it.
