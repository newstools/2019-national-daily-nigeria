Leader of the Sudan’s Interim Military Council has vowed to “uproot the regime” two days after a military coup that ousted President Omar al-Bashir.
Speaking on TV, Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan announced the restructuring of state institutions, the end of a night curfew and the release of political prisoners.
Protests continue despite the ousting of long-time leader, Omar al-Bashir.
Demonstrators demanded an immediate move to civilian rule and vow to stay on the streets until the military council quits.
Gen Burhan, who replaced the coup leader after he resigned on Friday, also dissolved all provincial governments and pledged respect for human rights.
Using a more conciliatory tone, Burhan also called on the opposition: “help us restore normal life”, promising to try those who killed demonstrators and vowed a war on corruption.
