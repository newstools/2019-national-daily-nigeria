President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the prosecution of the officers of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad  (SARS) who killed a football fan in Lagos.
The President said he regrets the recent action of the SARS operatives from the Lagos State Police Command, which led to the avoidable death of Kolade Johnson. He, therefore, commiserated deeply with the family of the deceased.
The president acknowledged the genuine outrage over the nefarious activities of SARS; he  assured Nigerians that swift actions have already been taken. Suspects are in custody and an orderly room trial is set to commence immediately, following which indicted officers will be prosecuted in court.
President Buhari maintained that the government will not tolerate in any way the brutalization of Nigerians or the violation of their rights.
He said an officer of the law enforcement agencies or any other government functionary caught in this act will certainly be visited with the full weight of the law.
President Buhari assured his administration will continue to ensure that all officers in the police and other law enforcement agencies conduct their operations in strict adherence to the rule of law and with due regard to international human rights and humanitarian law.
The presidency in 2018 directed the overhaul of the management and activities of the SARS, steps were also taken by the police leadership to restructure and reform SARS.
