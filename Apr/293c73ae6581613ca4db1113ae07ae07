Senator from Borno State, Ali Ndume, has been warned to respect All Progressives Congress (APC) leadership decision on Senate Presidency as the party would not accommodate any sabotage or a divided house.

The warning was handed to Ndume by the Yobe chapter of APC on Friday in Damaturu the state capital.

APC national leadership led by Adams Oshiomhole had insisted on current Senate Majority Leader, Ahmed Lawan, becoming the Senate President for the incoming 9th National Assembly.

However, Ndume would not accept that as he had continued to campaign to become the Senate President against the decision of his party leadership.

But, Abubakar Bakabe, Yobe State APC secretary, said in Damaturu on Friday, that “The interest of the party supersedes all other interests.”

He therefore asked Ndume to avoid “the pitfalls of the Bukola Saraki’s Senate presidency,” saying that must not be “repeated in the interest of the party, Nigeria and democracy.”

He said Benue State chapter of APC “expresses optimism that the Borno senator will remain loyal to the party, its leadership and President Muhammadu Buhari.

“As a party, we cannot afford to accommodate any sabotage and a divided house after the bitter experience of the last four years.

“The endorsement of Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan, for Senate President will provide the required leadership and coordination for the APC led administration to effectively execute its policies and programmes for the benefit of Nigerians.

“Lawan will run an inclusive leadership that will give every Nigerian a true sense of belonging and fulfillment, he has the required experience, knowledge and administrative skills for the senate to reclaim its glory as a progressive arm of government.”
