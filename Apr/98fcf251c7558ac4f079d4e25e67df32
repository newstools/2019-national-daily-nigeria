5 Nigerians caught in UAE for bank robbery





The federal government has lamented the risk faced Nigerians in Saudi Arabia over drug trafficking. The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Diaspora Matters, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, acknowledged that 20 Nigerians are currently on death row in Saudi Arabia.
Abike at State House, Abuja, on Tuesday, said eight other Nigerians have already been executed over drug-related offenses.
She condemned the five Nigerians who were recently caught on CCTC cameras robbing an ATM machine in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The SSA, however, observed that the action of the five Nigerians is not an indication that Nigerians are criminally minded.
