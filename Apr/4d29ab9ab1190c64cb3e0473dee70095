Real Madrid are confident of signing Paul Pogba and Eden Hazard this summer, according to Sky sources.
The Spanish giants are expected to overhaul their squad at the end of the season having missed out on the Champions League and La Liga titles, and the Premier League duo are high on their wish-list.
Pogba has received heavy criticism for his performances during Manchester United’s recent run of poor form, and is expected to leave if they miss out on qualification for the Champions League.
Hazard’s contract expires at the end of next season, and he has shown no inclination to renew the deal, meaning Chelsea will allow him to join Real if they match his £100m asking price.
