The Covener of the #EndSARS Movement Segun Awosanya Tuesday night accused the outgoing governor of Lagos State of not being responsible.
Awosanya called out Ambode for being silent over the extra-judicial killings of Lagosians by the some of the state’s police officers.
 
“The irresponsibility is so loud,” Awosanya tweeted.
 
“Citizens in your state are being decimated by your own police and you said nothing? If there be any shame in him he should have sent a representative,” he added.
 
Police brutality has been in the public eye in the past 3 three weeks. Some trigger-happy members of the Lagos State policemen have killed, at least, four innocent Lagosians – the fifth still hospitalized.
 
Police operatives from the Trinity Police Station, Ajegunle, Lagos, on Saturday killed a 20-year-old lady identified as Ada Ifeanyi; and the injured Emmanuel Akomafuwa suspected to be her beau.
Hello
The Lagos State Police Command gave Ada’s age as 20, and that of Emmanuel as 32.
