The Council of Traditional Rulers in Zamfara State has condemned
claims by the Minister of Defence that traditional rulers collaborate
with bandits to perpetuate crimes in the state. The Council,
therefore, challenged the Minister of Defense, Mansur Dan Ali, to name
traditional rulers involved in armed banditry activities in the state
to enable government to take appropriate actions against them.
The traditional rulers after a meeting to look into a statement
credited to Defense Minister that traditional rulers are conniving
with bandits in the state, demanded the minister to expose
collaborator found in the traditional institution.
The Council expressed appreciation for the marching order by President
Muhammadu Buhari to security agencies to immediately contain the
insecurity in Zamfara State.
The Council, however, stated that this can only be achieved if the
main camps of the bandits are taken over and security personnel
stationed there for a considerable period of time.
The Traditional Rulers also said the Council has been cooperating with
the government and security agencies over the years by providing
information about locations, routes, and names of persons engaged in
criminalsâ€™ activities.
The royal fathers commended the efforts of both the state and federal
governments in handling criminal activities in the state.
