The post-election crisis in Kano State deepened after 13 newly elected Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members into the State House of Assembly ignored the issuance of Certificate of Return by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and all newly elected legislators in Kano at the Sani Abacha Stadium.
It was gathered that all the PDP members-elect were absent from the ceremony which was attended by the legislators-elect of the All Progressives Congress (APC). They were perceived to have boycotted the COR issuance in protest of the outcome of the governorship election in the state.
It was also gathered that the venue of the COR distribution was dominated by thousands of APC supporters who gathered at the Sani Abacha Stadium to cheer Governor Ganduje at the event.
