Ortom has appealed for calm; assuring the people of the affected
communities that Benue State Government will do everything lawfully

Ortom expressed optimism that sooner than later, peace would return to
the troubled communities.

whip up sentiments, to remember that Benue is the only state they have
and if they allow politics to destroy it, the impact of such
destruction will affect everyone irrespective of political
affiliation.
He encouraged the people of Benue State to sustain the support and
collaboration with the state government in restoring peace to all
parts of the state.
