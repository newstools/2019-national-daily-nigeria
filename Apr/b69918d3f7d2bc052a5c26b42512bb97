Former governor of Akwa Ibom State Goodswill Akpabio, says he bears no grudge or bitterness against those who have betrayed him politically as he is comfortable in the fold of the All Progressive Congress (APC).
 
The former senate Minority Leader disclosed this in an interview while reacting to news making the rounds that he is planning to defect back to the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP).
 
“People don’t understand that life is full of ups and downs. Life is not a straight line. If it is a straight line, it means you are dead. Even if you have a temporary setback, that shouldn’t make you exude bitterness or hate anybody.

“I can’t go back to the PDP. Why are you people listening to rumour? Why will I go back to the PDP when I am already getting entrenched in the APC?
 
“I am excited that the President won the election all over the country,” Akpabio said.
 
Recall that Akpabio had last year announced his resignation from the PDP as Minority Leader of the Red Chamber and defected to the APC with critics summing up that he may have defected to the ruling party to escape prosecution.
