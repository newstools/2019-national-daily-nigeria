Governor’s second term hangs in th3e balance

The second term ticket of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu hangs in the
balance as the National Working Committee of the ruling All
Progressives Congress (APC) suspended the Ondo State Governor over
alleged anti-party activities.
APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Isa-Onilu, in a statement
after the NWC meeting presided over by the National Chairman, Adams
Oshiomhole, declared that the governor’s anti-party activities greatly
affected the fortunes of the party’s candidates in the presidential
and national assembly elections in Ondo State.
A member of the NWC was said to have stated that Governor Akeredolu
was suspended because his case is similar to the allegations against
the Ogun State Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, and the Governor of Imo
State, Rochas Okorocha, for which the two governors were already
suspended.

However, the suspension of Governor Akeredolu defines the battle
between Governor Amosun and the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola
Ahmed Tinubu, for the hegemony of the southwest APC. Akeredolu is a
known ally of Amosun, just like Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.
APC national chairman, Oshiomhole, is a renowned loyalist of Tinubu.
His emergence as national chairman is widely believed to be the
handiwork of Tinubu.
National Daily monitors the battle within the party as events unfold.
