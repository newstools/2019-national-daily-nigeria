Diego Simeone believes it was ‘very important’ for Antoine Griezmann to end his goalscoring drought in Tuesday’s 2-0 win over Girona.
The French forward ended a run of seven consecutive matches without finding the net for his club as Atleti closed the gap on league leaders Barcelona to eight points.
“It is very important for Griezmann to score of course and tonight was special because he’s a very good player,” Simeone told reporters after the match.
“He missed some chances before that but he kept believing and eventually good players will receive their rewards.”
Simeone also spoke of VAR awarding Atleti the first goal: “I sincerely thought that they weren’t going to give us the first goal, we are used to seeing goals like that disallowed when we score them.”
