The State of Israel has extended its 60 year old bible contest to Africa. Nigeria and Angola held the first edition on the continent in 2018. As the second edition opens, more African countries have joined in the contest.
Israel’s first Prime Minister celebrated the creation of the bible contest in 1958, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the State of Israel.
Israel has a place in history for the major religions of the world, especially Christianity. It prides itself as the country of the bible.
It is no surprise, then, that the State of Israel hosts an annual bible contest, an event that is now extended to Africa.
At the unveiling of the logo and theme for the second edition of the contest, the Ambassador made an announcement about the country’s spaceship.
One thousand, seven hundred Nigerians participated in the first edition of the contest with the three top winners getting all expense paid trips to the holy land of Jerusalem on pilgrimage.
