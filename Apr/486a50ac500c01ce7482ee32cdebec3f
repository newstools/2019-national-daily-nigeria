The Nigerian Senate on Tuesday commended the Nigeria Police for the improvement in security operations since the appointment of the acting Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu. DCP Frank Mba,Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, in a statement in Abuja, indicated that being immensely impressed by the resilience and ability of the Nigeria Police Force to perform considerably despite glaring inadequate funding amidst challenging circumstances, the Senate Committee on Police Affairs described the Nigeria Police Force and its officers and men as ‘’miracle workers’’ and ‘’unsung heroes’’ of Nigeria’s nascent democracy. 
He stated that the Committee which made the remarks on Tuesday when the Inspector General of Police, Ag. IGP MA Adamu, appeared before the Senate to defend the Police Budget, promised to support the IGP and his Team and expedite action on the passage of the Police Reform Bill. 
The Committee which was enthused with the ‘inclusiveness’ of the Police Management Team, urged the IGP to continue with his ongoing strides towards repositioning the Nigeria Police Force, promising to do all within its powers to pass the Police Trust Fund Bill so as to create avenues for alternative sources of funding the Force. The Committee in recognition of the IGP’s sterling leadership qualities asked the Police Boss to ‘’take a bow’’ and thereafter brought the sitting to an end. 
The Senate Committee on Police Affairs is chaired by Senator Tijjani Yahaya Kaura while the Vice Chairman of the Committee is Senator Stella Oduah.
