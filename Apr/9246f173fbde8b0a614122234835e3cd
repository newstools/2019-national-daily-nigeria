Senator Shehu Sani has said the current war of words APC leader, Bola Tinubu is having with Senate president, Bukola Saraki and speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, is fueled by the desire of the warring parties to control the leadership of the ninth National Assembly.
 
The lawmaker representing Kaduna central senatorial district at the National Assembly in a tweet on Sunday, April 28, also noted that the war of words between the politicians was a continuation of what transpired at the eight Assembly.
 
“Tinubu’s Cruise missiles fired from Ships and Submarines and Saraki’s Surface to Surface missiles and Dogara’s Ballistic missiles are continuation of the old war and the beginning of a new one,over the control of the eight and ninth regiment,” Shehu Sani tweeted.
