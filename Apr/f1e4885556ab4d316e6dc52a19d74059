The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has arraigned a businessman and his firm before Justice Saliu Saidu of the Federal High Court in Lagos for allegedly dealing in adulterated engine oil.
 
The defendants are Cajetan Chike Muonagolu and Richbon Nigeria Ltd. They allegedly committed the offence on December 12 last year at ASPAMDA Trade Fair Complex, Lagos-Badagry Expressway.
 
SON said they conspired to deal in 15,000 cartons of Prime Plasma, Prime ATF and Stanley brand of engine oil, which are of low quality. The prosecution said the defendants claimed that the products were genuine, contrary to Section 3 (6) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act of 2004.
 
They also allegedly failed to comply with SON’s Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) by dealing in engine oil that did not have the requisite MANCAP certificate.
 
According to the prosecutor, Adeleke Olofindare, the offence is punishable under Section 26 of the SON Act, 2015.
 
The defendants pleaded not guilty to the offence. Justice Saliu Saidu adjourned until Thursday, April 11.
