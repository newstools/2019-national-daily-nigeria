The Ondo State Police Command has vowed to arrest a fleeing man who is suspected to be responsible for the death of eight members of a family of nine whose daughter had been his girlfriend.
The fleeing suspect is believed to have set his erstwhile girlfriend’s family home on fire on Tuesday in Okitipupa Local Government Area.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Femi Joseph, gave this assurance in a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday.
Joseph, who described the incident as unfortunate, commiserated with the family of the deceased.
“I do not know what was on the mind of the suspect to have set ablaze the family members. This is very unfortunate.
“Although, the suspect is on the run, we are seriously on a manhunt for him for committing this dastardly act and we will bring him to justice,” he said.

NAN reports that the residents of Igbodigo in Ayeka, Okitipupa, woke up on Tuesday morning to the horrible sight of nine family members severely burnt by fire.
The arsonist, believed to be a jilted suitor of a female member of the family, was reported to have, at around 2 a.m. while the family members were asleep, poured petrol around their apartment and set it on fire.
NAN reports that one of the nine victims was rescued with severe burns and rushed to a hospital in Okitipupa.
The victim was later transferred to the state specialist hospital in Okitipupa, where doctors have been battling to save his life.
All efforts made by NAN to speak with Dr. Olumide Akadiri, the Chief Medical Director of the hospital on the matter proved futile, as he could not be contacted as at the time of filing in this report.
