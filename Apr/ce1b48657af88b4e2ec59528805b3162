The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has advised all chairpersons of its various chapters against falling into the trap of forceful migration to Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) through the federal government planned verification exercise.

In a letter written to Chapter Chairmen of the Union on Sunday, President of the Union, Professor Biodun Ogunyemi directed all her members not to fill the ‘2019 Personnel Data Verification Form’ being distributed for the purpose of the exercise by the FG.

ASUU did not only reject the idea by the FG but also described the move as a forceful and dubious trap to enlist lecturers on the earlier rejected Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).

“All chairpersons are advised against falling into the trap of forceful migration to the IPPIS. All chairpersons are strongly advised to discourage their members from completing the form under reference until the Union reviews its position on the IPPS.”



The letter by Ogunyemi reads; “The attention of the leadership of the ASUU has been drawn to a circular from the budget office of the federation directing members of our union to participate in a Personnel Verification Exercise designed for selected Ministries, Departments and Agencies.

“An item on the form requires the supply of “IPPIS no”. This suggests that the so-called exercise is a disguised way of bringing back the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) which our Union rejected in the past with informed arguments.
