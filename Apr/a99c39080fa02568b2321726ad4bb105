A total of 3,526 have been killed by bandits in Zamfara state with about 500 villages destroyed and 8216 persons injured in the last five years, Governor Abdullaziz Yari of the state revealed on Tuesday.

Speaking at a Town Hall meeting in Gusau attended by the acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, Yari who was represented by Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Abdullahi Shinkafi, also said that over 13,000 hectares of farmlands were either destroyed or made useless as the farmers can no longer farm them.

“The economy of the state has seriously suffered because thousands of shops were destroyed by the rampaging bandits who had displaced thousands of our people from their places of abode, many of whom cannot sleep with their two eyes closed because of fear,” he added.

Yari said the government had written volumes of reports containing over 7,000 pages, giving details of the crises right from the beginning to the infiltration from Libya and Boko Haram.

He disclosed that the government was aware of eight prominent bandits’ camps at different bush locations in the state, and urged that they should all be neutralized in order to decimate the criminals.

The governor said that recent suspension of mining activities in the state by the federal government must “be followed by enforcement, because, it is one thing to ban, and another to enforce.”

Earlier, Adamu, the acting IGP, told the gathering that the police would take more proactive measures in the fight against bandits and commended the state government for providing enabling environment to security personnel to operate in the state.

The town hall meeting was attended by traditional and community leaders including herders and farmers.
