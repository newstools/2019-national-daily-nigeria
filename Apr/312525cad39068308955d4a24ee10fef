Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo is confident that star player Antoine Griezmann will stay at the club despite heavy speculation linking him to Barcelona.
The 28-year-old was also linked to the La Liga champions last summer but decided to stay in the Spanish capital after penning a new deal. However, fresh rumours have now emerged linking the Frenchman with a switch to the Camp Nou.
But, despite the lure of joining the Catalan giants, club president Cerezo is confident the World Cup winner will stay at the Wanda Metropolitano.
Speaking to RTVE, the Atleti chief said: “Antoine will not move.”
When he was pressed further by a journalist asking him: ‘Griezmann remains safe, you’re 100 per cent sure?’ Cerezo replied: “Antoine remains at Atleti, for sure.”
Griezmann has enjoyed a formidable season to date, scoring 22 goals and providing 10 assists in all competitions.
