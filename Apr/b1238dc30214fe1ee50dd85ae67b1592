A Vermont girl isn’t happy that her disabled pet chicken was joked about on “Saturday Night Live.”
The chicken, named Granite Heart, is learning to walk with a custom wheelchair.
On a recent ‘SNL’ episode, the television show’s “Weekend Update” co-host said she should “just eat the chicken.”
Ten-year-old Alora Wood of Underhill, Vermont, tells NECN-TV that she knows the segment was meant to be a joke, but says what if it was a dog.
The chicken was born with a deformed foot.
The girl says: “Any creature, no matter how big, no matter how small, they deserve to have a perfect life.”
The custom wheelchair came from a company in Amherst, New Hampshire, that makes pet wheelchairs.
