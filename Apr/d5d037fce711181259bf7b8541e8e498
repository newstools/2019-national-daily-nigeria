Since July last year, ISWAP attacks on military bases and soldiers have increased, not only affecting the morale of the troops but also allowing the jihadists to restock vital arms and ammunition.
 
One of the most recent attacks came just hours before polling was due to begin in presidential elections on February 23, and saw rockets fired on the Borno state capital, Maiduguri.
 
Weapon experts have identified the rockets used as those captured from the Nigerian army in an attack on the Lake Chad town of Baga in December.
 
In the last four years, Boko Haram has attacked and sacked 22 military posts, killing hundreds of Nigerian soldiers.
 
The sacked military posts were in Gajiram, Mainok, Rann, Geidam, Sasawa, Magumeri, Malam Fatori, Gashigha, Kanama, Gamboru-Ngala, Mafa, Damasak, Gudumbali, Garunda, Kunduga, Kareto, Jilli, Arge, Zari, Arege, Metele, and Buni Gari.
