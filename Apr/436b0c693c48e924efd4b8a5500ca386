Two 100 level students of the Benue State University (BSU), Makurdi,
were reported drowned in River Benue, Benue State last weekend.
The deceased students, a boy and a girl, whose names were given as
Adakole Christopher and Mson Emmanuella were said to have gone with
some friends to play football by the riverside behind the school where
they met their untimely death.
Christopher, it was gathered, was a student in the computer science
department while Emmanuella was in the college of health sciences of
the university.
The incident was said to have occurred on Friday at about 6.00pm
beside BSU waterworks, an area close to the riverside that looks like
a beach.
The university management through the security unit, it was gathered,
immediately embarked a search and rescue operation to find the two
missing students.
The marine police, as well as divers, also joined in the search and
rescue operation which lasted several hours, late into the night on
Friday without success.
However, by Saturday afternoon, the bodies of one of the victims,
Christopher, was found floating on the river while the search was
still on to find the other student at the time of this report.
The body of the deceased student was immediately buried while
sympathizers have continued to besiege his family house in Makurdi to
condole with the family.
