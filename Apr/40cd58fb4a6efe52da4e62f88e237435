The Head of Press Unit, Ministry of Transportation, Abuja, Mr Mohammad Idris, disclosed this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Aba on Monday.
Idris was reacting to road blocks mounted in Abia by staff of the State’s Passenger Integrated Manifest Scheme (ASPIMS) for revenue collection.
He therefore called on security agencies to clear federal highways of such revenue collectors who use the highways as revenue collection ground.
According to him, the activities of these men hinder smooth flow of traffic on the affected roads and disturb travelers from other states passing through the state.
“The police and the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) should not allow these agents to block the highways.
“This is because their operations on the highways are illegal and obstruct the movement of travelers across the country.
