So it appears Man City are having less people showing up to watch their matches in their Stadium at Etihad. Could this be some serious issue?
There are persons who will take a hardcore of local support over a stadium full of tourists any day of the week.
To give the attendance last night some insight… they have got games coming thick and fast at the moment. They are doing rather well in three competitions having already won the other they were in this season. They were in London for a 12.30 kick off on Saturday, and played last night (evening games at City are always less attended), they have another trip to London on Saturday for an FA Cup Semi Final (4th time to Wembley alone this season, with another possible trip in May if we win on Saturday). They play Spurs away next Tuesday in the CL and then Palace away the following Sunday.
Four trips to London in the space of a couple of week over three competitions…I think their mainly working class fan base have a right to pick and choose which games they go to don’t you?
Even going further into April they then have pretty big home games against Spurs (twice!) and a Manchester derby to attend – they can chuck in two legs of a possible CL semi final should the team successfully negotiate Spurs .
Going to them all is hundreds and hundreds of pounds. Literally more money than most of us have as disposable income. If you fancy sponsoring a fan to go to the additional cup games and a possible trip to Turin/Amsterdam, the fan will be more than happy to accept your kind offer.
We will never for the life of us understand why attendances are used as a stick with which to beat clubs and in turn other supporters.
And may be if all fans come together to get ticket prices down (three figure ticket prices for trips to Wembley are a disgrace), unite as one for a greater good instead of finding something which doesn’t matter to point score with.
