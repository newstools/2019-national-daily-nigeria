About 17 people have been identified killed by a landslide in
South-Western Colombia. Five others were said to be injured and
several houses destroyed in the town of Rosas in the Cauca region.
The landslide had occurred after days of torrential rains hit the
region. Authorities were said to have continued search and rescue
operations in the rubble.
Landslides are said to be common in the Latin American country,
especially, during the annual rainy season.
While in the search for survivors, the Colombian authorities were said
to be clearing debris which is blocking a major local highway.
Colombian President, Iv√°n Duque, had visited the town on Sunday. The
President had revealed that medical assistance and alternative housing
was being arranged for those caught up in the landslide.
