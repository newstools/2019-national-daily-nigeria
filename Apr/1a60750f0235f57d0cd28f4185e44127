The governor of Ondo State Rotimi Akeredolu has vehemently denied being suspended by his party, the All Progressive Congress (APC).

According to him, he was neither issued a query as claimed by the party leadership nor has he received any letter to that effect.

Akeredolu in a terse SMS told Independent newspaper on Saturday: “I have not received any letter be it query or suspension. Thanks”.

Recall that a statement issued by APC spokesman, Lanre Issa-Onilu at the time said the National Working Committee would also issue a query to Governor Akeredolu over his glaring anti-party activities.

Last month, the NWC suspended Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State and Rochas Okorocha, of Imo State for anti-party activities.

The decision was reached at an NWC meeting in Abuja in March.

The committee also recommended the governors’ expulsion from the party.
