Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State on Tuesday commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the federal government over the establishment of the “Exercise Harbin Kunama 111” to combat the rising incidence of banditry in Zamfara State.
The governor in a press statement by the Acting Director, General Press Affairs to the Governor, Bashir Ahmad, in Gusau, described the development as timely, considering the intense spate of killings and kidnappings going on in some parts of the state.
The governor was of the view that the operation will accelerate the fight against the bandits that have been terrorising people in the rural parts of the state.
Yari assured the Nigerian Army of the state’s support for the exercise as it is planned to mitigate the current threats to security in Zamfara and its neighboring state. The governor also assured of Zamfara State Government’s commitment to providing adequate guidance, intelligence, and logistics for the effective and efficient operation.
Governor Yari called on citizens of the state to assist security agencies with relevant information that will help in flushing out the bandits and other criminals that have crippled socio-economic activities of the people in the state. He appealed to the media to professionally report the security situation with a view to succeeding in the operation.
