Justice Adumein said that the Constitution of the Osariemen Osunbor
primaries appeal panel to hear the case of the appellant having
announced him as the winner of the primary election by the Returning
Officer, was void and of no effect.
He said it was wrong for a former governor of Edo State to preside
over a panel in matters relating to electoral grievances

and against the defendant, Peter Akpatason.
