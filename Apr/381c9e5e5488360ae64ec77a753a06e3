Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has become the first governor in Nigeria to implement the N30,000 minimum wage recently  signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Akwa Ibom Governor had ordered immediate payment of the 30,000 minimum wage to Civil Servants in the State.
Some stakeholders are of the view that the Akwa Ibom State  governor is putting the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the lead of good governance and improved welfare of workers in the country.

The 30,000 minimum wage implementation was confirmed by some Civil servants in the state on Tuesday who have received salary payment alerts for the month of April 2019 ahead of Workers Day on May 1.
