Say Military Council ‘not capable of change’


The protesting Sudanese civilians have expressed their distrust on the emergent Military Council after the removal of President Omar Al Bashir. The protesters, therefore, sustained the protest for democratic transition in the country despite the promise of the Military Council to be brief in office.



The Sudanese Professional’s Association (SPA), which led the protest, dismissed the Military Council’s proposal for negotiation on the formation of a new government, saying the Council is “not capable of creating change”.
Pledging to resist the military’s move by peaceful means, the SPA restated its demand for power to be handed immediately to “a transitional civilian government”.
“We are still in the path of true revolution,” the Association said.
It was gathered that thousands of Sudanese protesters defied a nighttime curfew imposed from 10.00pm-4.00am to maintain their sit-in outside the army headquarters in the capital, and many more were continuing to join the crowds there.
“At the moment, these remarks do not seem to be enough,” a source in Sudan said; adding: “Their [the protesters’] whole point is that they don’t want anybody from the old regime or the former ruling party to be a part of the transitional council.”
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces also rejected the military takeover, the source further said, citing an announcement by the group, which said the military council’s move “falls short of what the people have been demanding for the past four months”.
The paramilitary forces said they would not take part in the military council, she added.
