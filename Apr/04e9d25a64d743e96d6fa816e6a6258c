Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson has resigned from his job as the team’s president of basketball operations, National Daily learnt.
The Lakers have failed to reach the play-offs for the sixth year in a row.
Johnson, who played a key role in bringing LeBron James to the team last year, broke the news before the 104-101 defeat by the Portland Trail Blazers.
“I had more fun when I was able to be the big brother and the ambassador to everybody,” the 59-year-old said at an impromptu news conference on Tuesday.
Johnson said he had not warned president Jeanie Buss of his decision to bring his two-year reign to an end.
“She doesn’t know I’m standing here because I know I would be crying like a baby in front of her, even though I’m about to cry now,” added Johnson.

“But it’s the right thing to do, the right move to make.”
Johnson, who said he had grown tired of the “the back-stabbing and the whispering” this season, also suggested he did not want to have to make a decision over the future of coach Luke Walton.
“There is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,” the statement said.
“We are deeply grateful to Magic for all that he has done for our franchise, as a player, an ambassador and an executive.
