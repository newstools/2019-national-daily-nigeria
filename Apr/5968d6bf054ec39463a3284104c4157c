The Emir of Kano, Sanusi Muhammadu Sanusi, has cried out over the increasing level of poverty in Nigeria. The paramount traditional
ruler, accordingly, demanded that the federal government to rise to
the task of addressing the increasing rate of poverty in the country.
Sanusi at a roundtable discussion in Kano organised by the
Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, MAN, on Tuesday, lamented the huge funds the federal government spends on subsidy annually.
Emir Sanusi, in his keynote address titled: “Poverty and
Underdevelopment in Africa” challenged African leaders to invest in young people to alleviate poverty.
Sanusi noted payment of subsidy for petroleum products by the federal
government has caused setbacks in other sectors of the economy.
Participants at the roundtable demanded the federal government to take advantage of the China-Nigeria economic relations to industrialise the economy.
The President of the Manifacturers Association of Niegria (MAN),
Mansur Ahmed, remarked that the slow pace of industrialisation and
manufacturing was the reason for the gathering.
