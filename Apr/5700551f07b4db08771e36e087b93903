The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has fuel marketers against hike in the pump price of petrol, adding that any erring marketers would be severely sanctioned.
Head of Retail Outlet and Marketing for Enugu field office, Anthony Douji, gave the warning on Friday ahead of Easter celebrations.
According to him, petroleum marketers who sell products above government approved prices risk having their stations sealed.
Douji said that the DPR would ensure that petroleum marketers complied with the directive of the NNPC to make products available for Easter celebration.
He said that the office had started monitoring compliance, adding that petrol stations must not sell above the regulated price.
He said that the intention was to ensure product availability during the festivity.

“We observed that while some petrol stations are selling at the regulated price, others sold above it. However, we prevailed on them to revert and they did.
“Our intention is to ensure that the products are available and not to create tension and artificial scarcity by sealing petrol stations that are defaulting.
“By the time you start sealing petrol stations, some of the marketers will start diverting products to areas where they will not be monitored.
“So, the best way is to encourage them to revert to government approved prices,” he said.
Douji, however, warned that the DPR would not hesitate to seal stations that failed to revert to the regulated price after initial contact.
“We have been receiving calls from members of the public about petrol stations selling above the regulated price and we shall seal such stations should they fail to revert,” he said.
