The Nigerian Air Force has disclosed that more aircraft have been dispatched to fight bandits in Zamfara State. The Force noted that the raging Air Strike against bandits in Zamfara State is beginning to make the criminals flee towards Nigeria’s border with Niger.
Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola in a statement indicated that the Air Force is working with other organs of the Nigerian military, essentially, the land troops, to prevent them from escaping through the Southern part of Niger Republic.
In the latest air strikes, eight camps of the bandits were bombed and
scores of them neutralized.
More aircraft have been deployed for the operations aimed at clearing bandits from their hideouts in Sububu, Rugu and Kagara forests, to free Zamfara State from invasion.
