Ricky, an avid Red Devils supporter, has had enough of the England striker – who he claims isn’t even a ‘Premier League footballer’
Marcus Rashford is regarded by many as one of the most talented youngsters in the world – but one Manchester United supporter doesn’t hold the striker in such high regard!
The 21-year-old, who has found the net on just three occasions in his last 14 games across all competitions, had a poor game by his standards as United fell to a 2-0 defeat at the hands of arch rivals Manchester City on Wednesday night.
That was remarkably their seventh defeat in just nine games, and Ricky, an avid United fan, made his feelings clear on the England striker when he phoned in to talkSPORT during Thursday’s Drive show.

“I watch him every week and I don’t rate him,” he said.
“I’m not just saying that because of the stats, I’ve looked at them ad have a vested interest.
“I don’t even think he’s a Premier League footballer. If he was at Burnley he wouldn’t get in their attack ahead of [Chris] Wood and Ashley Barnes.
“He’d walk in their team because of his name, but two months down the line their fans would be scratching their heads and thinking what does he do?!”
United, who are three points off the top four with three games remaining, entertain Chelsea on Sunday as they look to end their rotten run of form.
