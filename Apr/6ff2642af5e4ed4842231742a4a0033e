History was made today when the National Agency for Food Drugs Administration and Control, NAFDAC, destroyed 189 truckloads of expired, substandard and falsified medical products valued at N2,675,896,538.00 at the Oke-diya dumpsite in Sagamu, Ogun State.

The 189 trucks was said to be the highest number of truckloads of products to be destroyed in the history of NAFDAC.


Some of the products destroyed were either seized by the Agency from manufacturers, importers and distributors or voluntarily handed over to the Agency by compliant companies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and Trade Unions.

According to the Director General of NAFDAC, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, Tramadol worth N283.5 million, which could have destroyed many young lives and families, were destroyed along with other falsified medical products, unsafe cosmetics, counterfeits and other products.


Tramadol, she explained, is a ‘deceiver’ drugs which makes the individual feel good during consumption while it fries the brain as well as destroy different organs of the body.

In his remarks, the Director, Investigation and Enforcement, Barrister Kingsley Ejiofor linked the high number of truckloads of products to hardwork, intensified activity and strong collaboration with other stakeholders.

The representatives of the National Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Custom and the Police at the destruction exercise reiterated their commitment and support for NFDAC in reducing the quantity of fake, expired and adulterated drugs in the country.
