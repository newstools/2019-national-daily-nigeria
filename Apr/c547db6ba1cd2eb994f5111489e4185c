Nigeria Civil Service Union (NCSU) has expressed worries over the delay by the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to probe 22 commercial banks, which failed to remit Stamp Duty collections to the Federal Government.
Instead of investigating the banks as directed by the National Economic Council, the union said the RMAFC management was rather entertaining proposals from consultants and firms on the issue.
Amanabo Josiah, chairman, NCSU, (Nigeria Labour Congress), and Martins Adeoye, chairman, NCSU, (Trade Union Congress) in a joint statement in Abuja at the weekend, warned banks against dealing with consultants on the verification and reconciliation of revenue collection and remittances.
It added that the use of consultants for jobs that could be handled by the commission “is due to motive borne out of greed,” stressing that this was contrary to the anti-corruption fight of the present administration.

The union also raised the alarm over what it described as the undue interference with the activities of the commission.
It complained about the appointment of consultants to carry out functions, which the members of staff were capable of handling.
The NCSU said, “On the payroll of the commission are accountants, economists, statisticians and forensic auditors.
“However, upon the NEC approval for the RMAFC to verify and reconcile revenue collection and remittances by the Federal Inland  Revenue Services and Nigeria Customs Service from July 1, 2012 – December 31, 2015, the commission speedily engaged the services of over 100 consultants with a mandate to complete the assignment with effect from November 1, 2016 .”
The NCSU alleged that no commission staff member was involved in the assignment despite possessing the requisite qualifications, noting that there was no advertisement for the engagement of the consultants as stipulated by the Bureau of Public Procurement.
