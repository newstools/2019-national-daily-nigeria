Many youths under the umbrella of “End SARS Movement” joined other groups across Nigeria to protest the brutal killings of Nigerians by personnel of the Nigeria Police.
The youths decried the perennial gruesome killing of innocent citizens by policemen, the latest being the shooting of Kolade Johnson in Lagos State.
The youths cautioned against the consequences of allowing armed policemen to continue to maim and kill law-abiding citizens and go without being punished.
They demanded stringent measures and stiffer punishment against such policemen to serve as deterrence to others.
The youths also demanded the National Assembly to urgently pass the Police Reform Bill of 2018 and transmit same to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.
The Movement told the Police and the Federal Government to pay monetary compensation to families of citizens unjustly killed by policemen.
