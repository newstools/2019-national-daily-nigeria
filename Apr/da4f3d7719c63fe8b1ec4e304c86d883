Europan Union (EU) leaders have convened an emergency summit in Brussels to decide whether to offer the UK another delay to Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May currently under pressure from the disagreement by the British parliamentarians over the Brexit deal crisis, wants the date for UK to exit the EU beyond this Friday until 30 June.
But the EU is expected to offer a longer delay, after European Council President, Donald Tusk, urged the other 27 leaders to back a flexible extension of up to a year – with conditions.
Tusk added that “neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated”.
The head-to-head clash with opposition follows five days of talks between the government and labour officials aimed at breaking the Brexit impasse.
The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00hrs on Friday, 12 April and if extension is not granted, the default position would be for the UK to leave on Friday without a deal.
So far, UK MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement may reached with other European leaders last year.
But the commons has also voted against leaving in a no-deal scenario.
To prevent this happening, a group of backbench mps managed to get a bill through parliament to force Mrs May to ask for an extension to article 50 – the process that defines the UK exit date – by law.
