The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Sunday debunked report that that the commission is planning to interrogate or arrest three governors who would be completing their tenures in May 2019. The report identified the governors on target to include Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State, Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State, and Governor, Abdulazeez Yari of Zamfara State.
The report had speculated that ahead of May 29, 2019, handover date to newly elected governors of these states, the Commission has set up teams to probe some governors accused of perpetuating acts of corruption.
EFCC in a statement on Sunday by Tony Orilade, Acting Head of Media and Publicity, noted that the reporter failed to give the composition and terms of reference of the purported teams set up by the commission. The commission maintained that it does not go after anybody, including ex-governors on speculative grounds.
The Commission, then, admonished the media to be circumspect and verify their stories before going to press.
