Iran has warned the United States, US, against the labeling of the country’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps a terror group, protesting that it is “another US disaster”, Iran cautioned that the move could destabilise the region.
The United States designated Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a foreign “terrorist organisation”, President Donald Trump said on Monday; this the first time Washington formally labels another country’s military a “terrorist group”.
Critics have warned that the move could open US military and intelligence officials to similar actions by unfriendly governments. The United States has already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the IRGC but not the organisation as a whole.
Trump on Monday confirmed earlier reports that the US was planning the designation, saying the United States will continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on Iran “for its support of terrorist activity”.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the designation would take place in one week.

It becoming obvious that fresh crisis is looming between the US and Iran.


The world cannot forget with ease how US led other allies which include France, United Kingdom, Netherlands, etc, to bomb Iranian territory in 2018 under the guise that they were destroying the coutnry’s nuclear plant.
