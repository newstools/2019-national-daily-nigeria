The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomole, has reiterated his allegation that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was biased and worked against the ruling APC in the general elections.
Oshiomhole in an interview tagged: “Hard Copy” on Channels Television monitored from Lagos renew his allegation that the non-use of card readers caused the APC to lose elections in some states.
Oshiomhole protested: “I have huge reservations about the way INEC conducted this election. INEC bias against APC is so clear.
“INEC was biased even in the way it dealt with our primaries, INEC was biased in the way in which it selectively used the card readers or the non-use of card readers in some states where it suits them.”
The APC national chairman stated that he has no power to appoint anyone as Senate President, noting that he has little to say on the election of the leadership of the 9th National Assembly. He admitted that he can, however, organize the party lawmakers, make them know what might go wrong in the process of election National Assembly leaders.
He stated: “Do I look like someone who can appoint and impose somebody on the Senate, even if I wished to; all I have is to persuade.
“The power to negotiate and the power to point out what might go wrong if the party does not organize itself as to obtain a process for electing leadership.”
