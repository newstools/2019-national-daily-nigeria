Lagos State Government has rescued a mother with her twins (name withheld), along with her three other children after delivery from an uncompleted building in Igando axis of the state.

The rescue was a sequel to the viral video on social media of the mother and her children who were helpless and in dilemma. Commissioner for Youths and Social Development, Agboola Dabiri, made the remarks, yesterday while briefing the press in Ikeja on the rescue mission.

Dabiri explained that after the viral video of the mother and her children, the ministry raced down and rescued the mother and her children who were unstable at the point of arrival.

 He said: “We have rescued the mother and her five children including the twins from an uncompleted building. I can assure you that they are already stable.”

The commissioner, however, lamented that many have taken advantage of the issue to raise money from residents. “Despite rescuing the mother and her five children including the twins, who were in safe custody, pictures have continuously been circulated.

We have gotten several messages “The circulation of the pictures must stop and those using the pictures of the mother and her children to raise money must stop. No one should give money as charity to anyone for the sake of the children. They are with us. We are not asking for any donation.

 The children and their mother are now okay.”
