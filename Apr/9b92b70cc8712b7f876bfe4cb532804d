Some herdsmen suspected to have reportedly invaded Iyemoro-Ekiti community in Ekiti State were said to be on the run after they were said to have killed two indigenes of the community. The indigenes were taken unaware when the killer herdsmen suddenly overrun their community and inflicted damages but were repelled by some of the
indigenes who rose urgently to challenge the invaders, leading to their flight.
However, the Police preliminary report that no life was lost in
Iyemoro Ekiti, and that the community was only attacked by
armed-robbers, was said to have been countered by stakeholders who said that two lives were lost, and one other person injured in the fracas.
