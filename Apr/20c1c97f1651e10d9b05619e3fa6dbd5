The  treble is alive for Barca, who are preparing for a Champions League semi-final showdown against Liverpool.
Barca are also set to face LaLiga rivals Valencia in the Copa del Rey decider, with president Josep Maria Bartomeu insisting winning the treble is the “objective” for the Spanish powerhouse.

Asked about the treble, Suarez said: “We are in the line of working and being aware that on Wednesday we will play one of the biggest games [against Liverpool] we have all season and we have to do two big games if we want to achieve our goal.”

“These are two very important things for us [Champions League and Copa del Rey],” said Barca defender Clement Lenglet. “Now that we have this league we have to enjoy it but we also have to prepare ourselves for the matches that are coming, we will suffer again.”
