The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in Nasarawa State have filed a suit at the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal challenging the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.
The petition was filed just on Sunday to beat the Monday, April 1, deadline for submission of petitions arising from the governorship and state houses of assembly election held on March 9, 2019.
After submitting the petition, counsel for the PDP, Ola Olanipekun (SAN), said the APC did not win with majority votes at the polls. He stated that the election was marred by over voting, votersâ€™ intimidation and violation of relevant sections of the electoral act.
