In addition, the LASTMA boss said the law allows for penalties for neglect of traffic directions, while disobeying traffic control personnel also attracts fines and impounding of vehicles.
 
He warned that any motorist that proved to be an agent provocateur irrespective of position on the road will have his vehicle impounded and taken to LASTMA Yard to face appropriate sanctions in accordance with the relevant section of the law.
