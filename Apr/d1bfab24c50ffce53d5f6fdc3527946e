It was the bloodiest weekend in Rivers state as no fewer than seven people were killed in cult clashes across the state, and the manner of death—decapitation—made matter worse.
Four persons were beheaded in Omuoko, Aluu Community in Ikwerre Local Government Area as suspected cultists stormed Omuoko.  Rhino, Justice Azubuike, Nwobueze Eric Woke, and one other victim lost their heads.
Also in Rumuekini in Obio-Akpor LGA, of the state, an electrical and generator repairer was killed at his home at close of work.
Gunmen trailed and killed Eze-Otto Oshmael, the Community Development Committee Chairman of Rumuodogo 1, Community, Emohua LGA.
The late Ishmael had been receiving threat calls from some group of cultists in Emohua LGA before he was killed despite reporting the threat to security agencies.
Also it was gathered that a middle aged man was killed around 9pm by unknown gunmen who ride on black Toyota car around Okuru junction within Abuloma, Port Harcourt City LGA.
The Public Relations Officer of Rivers State Police Command, DSP Nnamdi Omoni said: “I heard about the incident in Aluu (Ikwerre LGA), but I am yet to get the full details of the incident. That of Aluu is confirmed. I have not been told about that of Obio/Akpor.”
The killing spree swept across four local government areas, and the killers were mostly armed in their cars as they moved around.
Cultism and its related violence has been rampant in the state since 2015.
