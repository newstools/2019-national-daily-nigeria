The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in its bid to ensure the continuous circulation of banknotes that are of good quality has issued out punishments for the abuse of the naira notes.
 
The CBN, therefore, defines an abused or a mutilated naira to be a note of poor quality requiring a special observation before its value can be determined.
 
The apex bank said the an abused banknote could be one that is partially/permanent damaged by fire, water, dye, insects, rodents or one destroyed by natural disasters.
 
The central bank, however, added that it and all Deposit Money Banks (CBN) shall continue to receive abused or torn naira notes from the public.
 
CBN roles out what can be considered to be an abuse to the naira notes:
1. Writing/Graffiti.
2. Mutilating.
3. Stapling the Naira.
4.Tearing or making hole of any kind.
5. Spraying,soiling or marching.
 
As punishments, offenders shall be liable to a fine of fifty thousand Naira or six months imprisonment or both under the provision of Section 21 of the CBN Act 20.
