And to do so, according to El Corriere dello Sport in Italy, the ‘7’ has already transferred to the management of his club six names of players with which he intends to share costumes next season to rise as a winner in the old continent.
 The names, according to the aforementioned media are: Nbdombele (Olympique de Lyon), Joao Felix (Benfica), Manolas (Rome), Federico Chiesa (Fiorentina) and the two most important Isco and Varane with whom he shared costumes during his time at the Real Madrid. In this way, the Portuguese player, legend of the merengue team could be exercising some kind of pressure to strengthen his team and in the process weaken Real Madrid as a possible rival in the future.
 Marcelo, with whom he has a great friendship, could also reach the Bianconero club but the fact is that Zidane’s return to the white bench and his good relationship with the French coach have reinforced the link and his union with the Bernabéu.
