The Supreme Court, on Monday, dismissed struck the suit filed by Senator Magnus Abe on the primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State.
Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Mohammed, in a unanimous judgment on Monday said that the Supreme Court dismissed the suit on the ground that it lacks merit.
The apex court indicated that the suit is incompetent and a gross violation of order 2 rule 8 of the Supreme Court rules. It held that once a notice of appeal has been found defective, it cannot be amended.
The Federal High Court in Port Harcourt had on January 7, nullified the direct and indirect primary elections conducted by the two factions of the APC in Rivers State.
The presiding Judge, Justice Kolawole Omotosho, further restrained the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from presenting and Magnus Abe as governorship candidates in the general elections.
The presiding judge maintained that none of the primary elections were conducted according to the law, noting that the INEC did not do well by submitting names of candidates without consideration of previous court orders.
Following the court’s ruling, Senator Abe filed an appeal against the nullification of the party’s primaries at the Supreme Court.
