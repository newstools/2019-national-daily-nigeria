The wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Hajia Aisha Buhari, at the
Adamawa State Indigenes Town Hall meeting on Saturday in Yola, the
state capital, expressed disappointed over decline in school enrolment
in Adamawa State.
The First Lady of Nigeria, an indigene of Adamawa State, raised alarm
that the low school enrolment is alarming, noting that the trend
spells a gloomy future for the state.
Aisha Buhari was said to have recalled that 40 years ago, the defunct
Gongola State (now Adamawa and Taraba states) was a beautiful and
peaceful state with relatively good infrastructure, well established
civil service as well as educational and health institutions.
The First Lady advocated that the state needs coalition of like-minded
people to return to its glorious past by addressing the challenges of
insecurity, inter-ethnic conflicts, the annual flood and influx of
internally displaced persons.
The President’s wife emphasized the need for establishment of Adamawa
Development Trust Fund through which prioritised development projects
would be financed and implemented.
