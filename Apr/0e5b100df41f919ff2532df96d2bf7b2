Focused on Europe, Di Maria explains that the recurring failures weigh on the Parisian club: “It’s very simple, we’ve been a different team. In the first leg, we made an exceptional match, we put the pressure, we showed character. We did not leave any room for Manchester. In return, it was the opposite. Sometimes, we feel the stress of knowing that it’s been years that the club wants to pass this barrier of the round of 16 and can not do it. ”
The Argentinian compares the situation of Paris to that of Real Madrid before his 10th trophy in the continental queen competition: “I won the Decima after many years of waiting (note: 12 years) and it was a satisfaction inexplicable. Winning first here would be unforgettable for me. “
