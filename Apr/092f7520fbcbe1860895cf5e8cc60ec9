Youths expressing their anger over the victim of Easter Monday killing
of some Boyâ€™s Brigade by NSCDC official in Gombe State, transferred
their aggression to innocent citizens who unluckily passed the
vicinity where they were carrying out funeral process for the deceased
on Saturday.
National Daily learned that youths had begun the funeral procession
peacefully but the procession turned violent when a group of youths
went on rampage as the mourners were going to the venue of the burial.
The youths were said to have assembled for the burial but resorted to
attacking people and vehicles they perceived to be hostile or
unsympathetic to their cause. It was gathered that tension is still
high in the Gombe State capital; the youths were said to be highly
obsessed with fury over the loss of their mates.
It was said that the procession turned violent at the FCE junction,
Gombe State. People within the vicinity and passersby were said to be
calling for the intervention of security operatives in the state. No
life has been declared lost at the time of this report.
