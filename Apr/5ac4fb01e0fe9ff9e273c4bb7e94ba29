Superstar Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Genevieve Nnaji has joined fans around the world to celebrate Nigeria’s Israel Adesanya for winning the UFC middleweight interim belt.

Adesanya cruised to victory on the fifth round with each judge scoring the fight 48-46. The pair met with the interim belt on the line as a result of events in February.

On his win, Adesanya said after the fight,

“I was willing to give it all and leave it all in there. I’m the champion, let’s go.”

Also reacting to his victory,  Nnaji tweeted a congratulatory message as she urged Nigerians to always value each other. She wrote,

“We the people will always be our nation’s most valuable resource. Let’s value each other, even when our Govt sleeps on us. Congratulations @stylebender. Thank you for yet another proud moment.”

Nnaji was recently in the news when she took to Instagram and shared an image which read that the ‘boys will be boys’ claim is a form of objectification and brothers can rise above the stereotype.

She pleaded with men not to reduce themselves to animals who don’t know right from wrong. Sharing the image she wrote;

‘Brothers, you can rise above the stereotype. Love y’all’.

This was coming after she recently described her own type of feminism as being about human rights. She made this revelation while speaking at the London School of Economics Africa Summit, where she mentioned that everyone has a right to live life just the way they desire it to be.
