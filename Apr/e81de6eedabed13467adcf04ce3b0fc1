Special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has sent a stern warning to the presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar.

She claimed she saw a photo of Atiku with some “weird inscriptions” and warned the PDP candidate in the February 23 presidential election, which Buhari won, to shun involving himself in any “mischief” that could land him in court for treason.

Onochie, who failed to disclose the content of the supposed Atiku’s ‘weird photo’ said the former Vice President should enjoy the fact that he is lucky still walking free.

She stated this in a post on her Twitter handle which read:

“I just returned to Abuja and saw @atiku’s photos with some weird inscriptions for one who is lucky to be walking free, whatever he is planning, he shouldnt forget that we have a President in place. Nigerians will insist that treason be treated as treason. He should counsel himself.


“When you lose an election, you either congratulate the victor or you challenge the election results in court. After foot-dragging, @atiku has now managed to go to court. It’s in the best interest of the nation that he continues in that legal path instead of stirring mischief.”
