The national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, at eh weekend led a delegation of the party on a thank-you visit to the President of Niger. The visit came a few weeks after the 2019 presidential election which held on February 23 across Nigeria.
The delegation was dominated by selected prominent northern leaders of the party who accompanied the PAC chairman on the presidential visit to Niger Republic.
It was not clear what the mission of the visit was at the time of this report. Efforts to get clarifications from the APC national secretariat, Abuja, were not successful.
However, it will be recalled that Niger Republic had sent a powerful delegation led by two Governors to the presidential campaign of the APC candidate in the 2019 election, President Muhammadu Buhari when the APC presidential candidate launched the party’s campaign in Kano, Kano State, during the electioneering campaigns. More so, there were allegations of APC purportedly ‘importing’ thugs into Kano during the elections, though, the party refuted the allegations.
Meanwhile, National Dailysustains inquiry into the visit to Niger Republic by APC leaders for further details.
