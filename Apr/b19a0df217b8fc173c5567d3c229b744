The 75-year-old who lived in Florida raised the bird in his farm as one of his exotic pets.
Cassowary which is now in police custody according to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office has been described as one of the most dangerous birds in the world.
The bird has three species and is native to the tropics of Queensland, Australia and New Guinea.
They belong to the same family as Ostriches, Emus and Rheas.
