Cardiff City have submitted evidence to FIFA in their dispute with Nantes over the transfer fee for striker Emiliano Sala.
French side Nantes referred the dispute to FIFA with Cardiff refusing to make any interim payments towards the £15m transfer fee.
The 28-year-old Argentinian became the Premier League club’s record signing on January 19, but then died in a plane crash over the English Channel two days later.
Since then the two clubs have been locked in a bitter dispute over the £15m fee, with the French side demanding payment and Cardiff claiming the deal was not completed.
FIFA gave both clubs an extension to submit their evidence until Monday 15 April and Cardiff confirmed they had met the deadline in a short statement

The Premier League club issued a short statement, that said: “Cardiff City FC has today submitted its answer to FIFA in response to the claim filed by FC Nantes on 26th February 2019”
Sky Sports News understand Cardiff will insist that Nantes’ conditions for completion of the deal were not fulfilled, and will argue that Sala was not registered as a Premier League player.
The French club refute Cardiff’s claims and claim they are fully compliant with FIFA rules, and point to the fact that FIFA registered the International Transfer Certificate on January 29 at 5.30pm.
