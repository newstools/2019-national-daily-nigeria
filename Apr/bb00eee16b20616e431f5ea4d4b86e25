Presidency has yet to confirm the resignation of the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, even as the news gathers momentum.
It was reported that Onnoghen’s resignation letter was submitted to the Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari, by some Justices of the apex court.
The Justices arrived at the presidential villa few minutes after President Muhammadu Buhari left Abuja for Jordan to participate in the World Economic Forum (WEF).
A presidency source confirmed that President Buhari had on Thursday, before his departure to Jordan, received the National Judicial Council’s recommendations on the petitions written against Onnoghen, and the acting CJN, Justice Tanko Muhammad.
The report was submitted to the president by his Chief of Staff, Mallam Abba Kyari, who was accompanied by the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubalar Malami, at about 2.20p.m on the fateful day.
All efforts to speak to presidential spokesmen, Mr Femi Adesina and Mallam Garba Shehu, on the matter proved abortive as the duo were outside the country on official and private engagements.
Adesina is currently on President Buhari’s entourage to Jordan while Shehu is believed to be in Saudi Arabia on pilgrimage.
Onnoghen’s trials started when a petition was filed by the civil rights group at the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) alleging that he owns”sundry accounts primarily funded through cash deposits made by himself up to as recently as 10 August 2016, which appear to have been run in a manner inconsistent with financial transparency and the code of conduct for public officials.”
Onnoghen who was accused of failing to fully declare his assets, was nominated as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria by the Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, he was confirmed by the Senate on 1 March 2017, and sworn in on 7 March 2017.
