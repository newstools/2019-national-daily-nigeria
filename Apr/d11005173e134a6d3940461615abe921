The Police have arrested two suspects over the kidnap of the Lagos Fire Service Chief, Razak Musibau, along Epe-Itokin road in Ikorodu.
The suspected kidnappers were arrested in the early hours of Wednesday, at Ibafun along Ikorodu- Ijebu Ode Express Way.
The Police Public Relations Officer of the Lagos State Police Command, Elkana Bala,  confirmed the arrest, saying that it was made possible by efforts of the Command’s tactical teams.
Police identified the suspected kidnappers as Blessing Bayo, (M) 29yrs, and Smart Alfred (M) 32yrs. They were said to have confessed to the crime. Both arrested suspects were further identified as indigenes of Ondo State. Two single barrel guns were said to be recovered from them.
The Police said that investigation is ongoing, and efforts are being made to arrest other fleeing members of the gang.
Musibau and six others were abducted by some hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers last Saturday at about 8.00pm along the Iwoye Bridge on Itokin-Epe road in Ikorodu.
They were released on Tuesday night after being in captivity for about four days.
