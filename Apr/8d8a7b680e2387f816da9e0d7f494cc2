Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hit back at claims from former Manchester United boss Louis Van Gaal that his team “park the bus and play on the counter attack”, National Daily gathered.
The Dutchman’s words resonated with the team’s laboured 2-1 win against Watford on Sunday, where the winning goals scored by Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial came largely against the run of play.
“LVG is entitled to his opinion,” the United manager said. “We’ve been looking at games. Some games we’ve pressed really high and won the ball up there and dominated.
“He’s probably talking more about the PSG game, which was a game that we had to defend really well in the circumstances and counter attack.
“It’s about where you win the ball. You want to defend to win the ball to go forward. You have to win the ball to attack and for me there’s two ways.
