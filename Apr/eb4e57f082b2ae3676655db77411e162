Just before sunrise, today, a Nigerian man living in a fenced apartment got a visit he never anticipated.

He was left in shock and awe after witnessing a particular scene.

He was so disturbed by the event that he later took to popular social media platform to share his experience.

According to him two birds forght to death in his compound.

“Early this morning around 3:26 am, I woke up as a result of a sound on one almond fruit tree beside my window , when I listen very well I discovered it was two birds fighting, initially I didn’t take it serious and I went back to sleep”.


So it was around 6am just after he was dressed for work that he heard the birds still fighting at a side of his building,

“and I went there to see, when I got there I saw that it was soo serious that two of them were very weak. And they were both unwilling to surrender to each other. It got to the extent that if one moved back the other will chase back to continue the wrestle” he narrated.

As they kept fighting the man went in back to get fully prepared for work. And he was there when he heard a loud fall. He rushed out and saw one of the bed had fallen.

As he approached to get a proper view, the other bed walked slowly across the roof before suddenly falling to the ground dead as well.

He said the situation, “looked so strange cos I don’t know what can happen between common animals that can make them fight untill death”.
