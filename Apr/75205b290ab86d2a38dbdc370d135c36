The Committee on Appropriation in the Lagos State House of Assembly on
Friday submitted its report on the 2019 Appropriation Bill presented
to the House by Governor Akinwumi Ambode for passage into
Appropriation Act. Though the bill was earlier scheduled for passage
on Friday but had to be shifted because of the late submission of
report by the House Appropriation Committee.
The presentation of report of the Committee on Appropriation on the
proposed 2019 budget was said to be last item on the legislative
schedule of the State Assembly on Friday.

National Daily learned that the Committee Chairman, Gbolahan Yishawu,
read out details of several adjustments the committee made in the
proposed appropriation bill. Some of the adjustments were identified
to include special considerations given to some ministries,
departments and agencies where the committee felt would require more
funds while the budget is being implemented throughout the year.
Some of the agencies were identified to include the Lagos State
Building Control Agency, the Ministry of Environment, among others.
The appropriation committee highlighted that members recommended the
House approval  of appropriation of a sum of N389,560,227,242 from the
Consolidated Revenue Fund for Recurrent Expenditure and a sum of N462,
756, 709, 241 from Development Revenue Fund for Capital Expenditure,
culminating into a total budget of N852.317 billion for the year
ending December 31, 2019.
Part of the recommendations made by the committee focused on the need
for the House to set up committees that would look into the execution
of some capital projects recently embarked upon by the executive arm
without the approval of the House.
The report was adopted for debates but was subsequently suspended for
deliberations to a later date.
