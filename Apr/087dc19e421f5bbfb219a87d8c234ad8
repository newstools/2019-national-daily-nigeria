Two remaining suspects being prosecuted for shooting of worshipers at Ozubulu Catholic Church in 2017 have been freed by the trial court. A State High Court in Awka, Anambra State, discharged and acquitted the two suspects facing prosecution for the shooting of worshipers at St Philips Catholic Church, Ozubulu, on 6th August 2017.
In the judgment that lasted over three and half hours, the presiding judge, Justice Fidelis Aniukwu, stated that the prosecution counsel could not prove beyond reasonable doubt the allegations brought against the two defendants, Chinedu Akpunonu and Onyebuchi Mbanefo.
The judge maintained that the prosecution witnesses failed to provide any evidence linking the defendants with the murder of the 13 worshipers at the St Philips Catholic Church, Ozobulu as alleged.
The defence counsel, Festus Kayemo, who was represented in court by another counsel, Samuel Echeakputa, described the judgement as landmark, commending the accelerated hearing granted by the presiding judge.
One of the defendants, Chinedu Akpunonu, who went on wild jubilation, thanked God for vindicating him from what he described as an attempt by some persons to dent his image and reputation.
Four suspects were arraigned before the state High Court in November 2017 after unknown gunmen attacked and killed 13 worshipers at the St Philips Catholic Church, Amakwa, Ozubulu in Ekwusigo Local Government Area.
The judge had in December 2018 discharged two of the four persons standing trial for lack of evidence by the prosecution counsel toconvict them.
