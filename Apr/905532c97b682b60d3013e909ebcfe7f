The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja warned members of the Kogi State House of Assembly over allegedly allowing Governor Yahaya Bello to push them to act beyond their boundaries, and join in the odious conspiracy to forcefully remove the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Nasir Ajana.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement argued that there is no provision in Nigeria’s constitution that empowers the state legislature to superintend over the judiciary or direct the powers and functions of the National Judicial Council (NJC) on issues pertaining to judges, let alone a state Chief Judge.
The PDP also argued that the recommendation of the Kogi State House of Assembly for the removal of the State Chief Judge is “a misdirected shadowboxing, which not only exposes the state legislature to public ridicule but also reinforces impressions and allegations in the public space that it has been compromised to execute ignoble schemes of the state executive”.
Ologbondiyan observed that the development is not healthy for the image of the legislators in the state and could lead to their recall by their constituents.
“The powers and functions of the state legislature vis-a vis those of the judiciary are well carved out in our laws and should be respected at all times. The ostensibly induced action of the Kogi state legislature is therefore a direct affront to our constitution and invitation to anarchy.
“The Kogi lawmakers should note that they were elected to uphold good governance and rule of law for the benefit and welfare of the people of Kogi state, and not as instruments of witch-hunt and intimidation in the hands of an anti-people, repressive, incompetent and grossly corrupt administration, which has no regard for the law and the will of the people.
“Moreover, the lawmakers should note that in ditching the constitutional provision of separation of powers and joining in assaulting the independence and sanctity of the judiciary, they are also setting their parliament on the path of self-destruct and complete annexation by the executive.
“The party therefore charges the members of the Kogi State House of Assembly to immediately retrace their steps and ensure that as lawmakers, they are not found on the wrong side of the law,” PDP declared.
