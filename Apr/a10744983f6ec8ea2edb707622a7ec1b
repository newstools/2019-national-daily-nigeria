Former President Jacob Zuma of South Africa’s has denied an allegation by a local newspaper that former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi gave him $30 million (£22m).
Zuma tweeted that he knows nothing about the allegation.
The allegation is that the money had been stored in a vault since 2011 in Zuma’s private home before it was moved to Eswatini early 2019. The report indicated that the country’s monarch King Mswati III was aware.
The Sunday Times stated that the money was to secure late Colonel Gaddafi legal representation if he was captured and taken to court or to pass on to his family if he was killed.
The Libyan leader was caught and killed in 2011.
The paper also alleged that Zuma’s successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, had knowledge of the cash movement.
