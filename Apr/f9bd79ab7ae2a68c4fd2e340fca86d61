Three men who forced a teenager to restrain nine female horses, a cow, a goat and dogs while they had sex with the animals have been jailed for decades.
Matthew Brubaker, 31, Terry Wallace, 41, and Marc Measnikoff, 34, were all sentenced to 20 to 41 years in prison on Monday after regularly abusing at least 12 animals for years.

The discovery was made after police were called to a remote “makeshift farm” where the men all lived in Munson, Pennsylvania, in August 2018, according to Clearfield County District Attorney’s Office.

They were arrested after a 16-year-old boy living at the property told police the men had been having sex with the animals in a specially-designed V-shaped pen.


Officers found a “large volume of homemade videos, recording equipment and cameras”.
The men were charged with more than 1,400 counts relating to sexual intercourse with animals, cruelty to animals, endangering the welfare of children, and corruption of minors.
Clearfield County District Attorney William Shaw said it was one of the most extreme cases of animal abuse he had handled.
protective custody but that there were no allegations of him being sexually abused.
The animals were all rescued and police have been working with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to find an appropriate place for them to be re-homed.
