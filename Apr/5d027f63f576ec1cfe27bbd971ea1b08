The Joint Admission and Registration Board has de-listed 14 Computer Based Test centres out of the 712 accredited due to infractions such as technical hitch and deceit.

Prof. Ishaq Oloyede made this known when he led the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, on a visit to some CBT centres in Abuja during the mock examination.

Oloyede said that the 698 centres left in the operations were ready for the conduct of the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Education scheduled to hold between April 11 and April 15.

He added that the board was prepared for the over 157,000 candidates sitting for the examinations.

“So far, so good; all the centres are doing very well. Of the 712, we have had to dis-accredit 14 this morning for one infraction or the other

“Some had technical problems and some due to deceit whereby some of them will go and borrow some computers, thinking that we will not know.

“Those centres we discovered went ahead to borrow computer systems for the exams have been dis-accredited. Now, we have about 698 centres left in the operation, but we have distributed the students across board.”

Oloyede added that the mock examination was free in JAMB-owned centres, as it was a way the board gets the operations of the system ready ahead of the main examinations.

He said only candidates writing the mock examinations at privately-owned CBT centres would pay N700.
