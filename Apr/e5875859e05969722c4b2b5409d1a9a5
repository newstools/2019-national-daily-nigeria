The Chief Imam of Al-Furqan Mosque in Kano, Dr Bashir Omar, has urged the Federal Government to declare state-of-emergency in Zamfara State to address incessant kidnappings and killing of innocent citizens.

He made the call in his sermon during prayers in the mosque on Friday.

Omar said that the call was necessary in order to check the wanton killings currently going on in the state.

“The wanton killings and kidnappings can only be stopped through the introduction of State-of-Emergency by the Federal Government.

“The people of Zamfara State deserve pity and all forms of compassion to enjoy a peaceful living because the pogrom has consumed many lives with almost no end in sight.

“This is not the first time I am calling on the Federal Government to declare a State-of-Emergency in the state to end the killings,” he said.

According to him, the perpetrators of the dastardly acts are made to have a field day in the absence of punitive measures on ground to checkmate such despicable atrocities.

The cleric stressed the need for the government to match its words with action on how to end the disturbing spate of criminal banditry in the state.

He stated that kidnapping innocent citizens on the highways and other secluded areas had become a money-spinning business.

“Only those who lack absolute fear of Allah turned kidnapping as a business hence our decision to call for the imposition of emergency rule to put the abduction kingpins out of business.”

Omar explained that no economic development could ever be achieved with the Federal Government paying lip-service to the issue of security in the country.

“The Federal Government should be proactive in finding a lasting solution to the problem,” he stated.
