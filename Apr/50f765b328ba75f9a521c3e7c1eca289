There is increasing mix-up over court judgment on the certificate scandal in which the eligibility of Senator Ademola Adeleke to contest the September 2018 Osun governorship election has been in question.
The Court of Appeal, siting in Akure, on Saturday insisted that Senator Adeleke is qualified and eligible to contest the governorship election in Osun State which held in September 2018.
The Court of Appeal, therefore, upturned an appeal challenging the judgement of Osun High Court which upheld the eligibility of Senator Adeleke to contest for the governorship of Osun State.
The Osogbo High Court had in its jdugement held that Adeleke is qualified to contest for the governorship election, having been educated up to secondary school level as required by the constitution.
The petitioners not satisfied went on appeal to challenge the judgement. They argued that Senator Adeleke is not qualified to contest the election, saying that, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, the runner up in the governorship primary election of the PDP should be awarded the PDP governorship ticket.
The Court of Appeal in Akure, Osun State, in its judgment, dismissed the appeal on three grounds, upholding the judgement of the lower court that confirmed the eligibility of Adeleke for the election.
According to the judgment, the first ground was that the court has no jurisdiction to hear the case .The second was that the petitioner has no locus standi to file the case, and third was that the matter was brought to court outside the stipulated 14 days after the conduct of the PDP primary election.
Meanwhile, an FCT High Court had disqualified Senator Adeleke from the governorship election citing alleged certificate or examination fraud. The senator had since gone on appeal.
