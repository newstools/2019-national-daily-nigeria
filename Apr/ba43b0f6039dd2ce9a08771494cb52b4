The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has stated why he cannot work with Senator Dino Melaye, the lawmaker representing Kogi West district in the National Assembly.
According to Gov. Bello, he cannot work with Dino Melaye because their ideologies for joining politics are different.

Gov. Bello stated that much in a statement issued by Kingsley Fanwo, the Director-General of Media and Publicity to the Governor, while responding to claims by Melaye that the sitting governor had not completed any project since coming into power three years ago.

He said, “On Dino Melaye, we always try to avoid giving him undue attention. The ideologies are different. Yahaya Bello is in politics to develop, Melaye is in politics to share and blackmail.

“So, there is a very sharp difference between the two of them and that is why it is difficult for the two of them to work together because the ideologies are quite different.”

Gov. Bello, however, appealed to Melaye not to plunge the state into crisis with his governorship ambition.

“Now that Melaye said he wants to be governor and he is campaigning, I hope he will give peace a chance and not throw our state into crisis because as a government, we have invested so much insecurity and whenever there is crisis, it always leads to a reversal of the gains we’ve recorded in the area of security of lives of our people,” he said.
