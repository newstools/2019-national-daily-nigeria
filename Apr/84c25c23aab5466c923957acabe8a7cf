Katsina United coach Abdullahi Usman Biffo has said top priority for his team is to stay up in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) by season’s end, National Daily gathered.
“Our priority this season is to maintain the Premier League status, but we will see how things pan out before the end of the season, “ said the former Abia Warriors coach after he led Katsina United to go past Lobi Stars Sunday.
“We will have to look at our position by the time we have three or four games to the end of the season, then, we can be talking of featuring in the Super Six.
“If we find ourselves in a good position by that time, why not? We will also fight to ensure we take part in the Super Six, but like I have said, our priority is not the Super Six, but to maintain our status in the Nigeria top flight league.”
The Kwara-born coach also stated that his team inability not to have won a single game on the road since they returned to top flight league three seasons ago was down to the poor mentality of the players towards away games.
“We all know in Nigeria that winning on the road is very difficult and that has adversely affected the thinking of the players, as a result they tend to put up a poor showing on the road.
“The players are always of the belief that no matter how well they play away from home, the result will never favour them at the end of the game. This is a very bad mentality and the players have to change it, if they want to get positive results on the road.
“It’s not only peculiar to my team, all the clubs in Nigeria are suffering from this syndrome.”
