Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State has lamented the incessant conflict between Jukun and Tiv communities in Taraba and Benue states.
The governor in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Bala Abu, on Friday decried that the latest of such conflict was that of Kente, a border community in Taraba.
Governor Ishaku condemned the incident which occurred last weekend as a result of a minor conflict between a Jukun person and a Tiv person and later degenerated into a bitter conflict leading to some casualties.
The Governor enjoined residents of the affected border communities to live together in peace in order to attract government amenities that would make life easier for them.
He admonished that frequent conflicts can only lead to disruption of economic activities and aggravate poverty and hunger.
“As neighbours, the two groups need each other for economic survival. Therefore, they must cooperate in protecting their communities against any form of threat to peace in the area,” the statement said.
