He also advised Muslims to hasten and seek repentance from the almighty Allah ahead of the month of Ramadan.
Al-Yolawi, who is the Chief Imam of Area 10 Mosque, gave the advice while delivering a Jumma’at sermon titled Tips for Ramadan Preparation on Friday in Abuja.
The cleric said that Muslims are expected to ensure continuous repentance before the blessed month of Ramadan so that they could begin the exercise with clean and pure heart.
“The almighty Allah says in the Holy Qur’an, “And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.
“It was narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, ‘O people, turn in repentance towards Allah and ask His forgiveness.’”
He explained that Ramadan was the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, adding that it was a month of blessings in which Qur’an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad.
Al-Yolawi said that fasting in the month of Ramadan was one of the five pillars of Islam, adding that fasting was a protection against sin and evil action.
The cleric admonished Muslims to strive to acquire knowledge related to the dignity of the month of Ramadan and complete all engagements that could distract them from worship ahead of time.
He appealed to traders to fear Allah and make the prices of essential commodities needed in Ramadan affordable in order to earn Allah’s mercy and blessings.
