Coach Thomas Dennerby has said he believes that a good start by the Super Falcons will ensure they go past a tough World Cup group that has hosts France, former world champions Norway and Korea, National Daily learnt.
“We hope we get good results against Norway and Korea in our first two games so that we will be more relaxed when we face France, who are one of the favourites to win the competition,” Dennerby explained.
“All the groups are tough because all the teams have improved.
“Norway have previously won the World Cup as well as the Olympics and Korea are also a strong team, like China.
“We can reach the round of 16 with the right results in our first two games.”
The nine-time African champions have prepared for the World Cup with matches in China, Cyprus and most recently Spain.
Dennerby said the biggest asset of the Falcons is the speed of their attack.
“We have quick players in front and that will be great in counter attacks,” he said.
The Falcons will open their World Cup training camp in Austria on May 20.
