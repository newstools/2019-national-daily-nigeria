Former Juventus goalkeeper and current Ajax director Edwin van der Sar warned they “want to get back to the top of European football.”
“It is a very important game for Ajax. I played with Cristiano Ronaldo for four years at Manchester United. I had only two years at Juve, unfortunately, but I hope it’ll be a great game for us,” the former goalkeeper told Sky Sport Italia in after all these years a still impressively fluent Italian.
“Our players are young, but have already played in Europe, Frankie de Jong has been in the senior squad for a while. It’s tough against a very experienced Juventus side, but then we beat Real Madrid three weeks ago and want to show our style of football.
“It’s the history of Ajax, we have always done well on the continent, but we want to get back to the top of European football. It’s wonderful to be in the quarter-final, but we want to go further this season and over the next few years.”
