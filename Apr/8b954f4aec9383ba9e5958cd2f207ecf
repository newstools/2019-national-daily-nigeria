Olawale Oloforo, Nigerian Afrobeat singer, better known as Brymo, has cancelled his 2019 Easter Sunday concert in Abuja amid sponsorship problems.
Dubbed the ‘Brymo Live in Abuja Concert’, the show was previously scheduled to hold in Abuja on April 21, 2019.
Joey Akan, Nigerian music journalist, took to Twitter to announce the cancellation on behalf of the singer, saying it was due to a sudden unresponsiveness on the part of the event sponsors
“Brymo and his management regret to announce that due to unforeseen circumstances, we are forced to cancel the Brymo Live in Abuja Concert scheduled to hold on Easter Sunday, April 1, 2019,” the post read.
“Brymo, his brand and team have been preparing for the concert for weeks and it saddens us to cancel at this time. The cancellation is due to a sudden lack of response from our sponsors.”
“We apologize for any inconvenience this cancellation may cause. All tickets purchased will be fully refunded.”
