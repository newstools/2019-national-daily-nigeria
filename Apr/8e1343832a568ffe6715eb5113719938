Several stakeholders in Rivers State, including elder statesmen, have been expressing discontentment over the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to adjourn to Wednesday morning the declaration of results of the Governorship election results in Rivers State.
Of the 23 Local Government Areas in Rivers State, INEC said results were available for 17 LGAs. However, results from 15 local government areas were announced on Tuesday while the commission said those for the remaining two local government areas will be announced on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was declared winner of the Rivers west and Rivers East senatorial district elections, including the Degema/Bonny Federal constituency elections.
