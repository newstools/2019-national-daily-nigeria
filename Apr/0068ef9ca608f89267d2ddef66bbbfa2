The newly-elected Chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), in Oyo State, Comrade Bayo Titilola-Sodo, has declared that there is no excuse for any state governor in Nigeria to delay implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage in their respective states.


Titilola-Sodo made this declaration on Thursday while speaking with journalists shortly after he was declared Chairman of the NLC at the union’s election/ NLC delegates’ conference held at Adamasingba stadium, Ibadan, the state capital.


Other elected executive officers of the union elected during the election were; Adedeji Taofeek, (Vice chairman 1) Martins Bayonle, (Vice Chairman 2), Rukayat Afonja, Chairperson; Ademola Babalola (Treasurer) Oladele Olusegun (Auditor 1) and Folorunsho Olujimi, (Auditor 2).

Titilola-Sodo in his acceptance speech explained that, “The implementation of the N30,000 minimum wages should be immediate without further delay.


“The President has signed it, it is a law and the law is bidding on all the 36 state governors.


“It is a law, it requires no persuasion; it covers all the states of the Federation. The outgoing governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi promised to pay N30,000 minimum wage, the governor-elect, Engineer Seyi Makinde also promised us even before the election.


“So, we would hold both of them to their words. A situation where workers are paid their salaries as at when due, a situation where workers enjoy their benefits as when due

“A situation where nepotism and favourism are not allowed, a situation where workers are not victimised, where justice prevails and act of the day, where sanity is brought into the system unlike the present situation.”
