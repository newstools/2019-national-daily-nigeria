Troops of Operation SHARAN DAJI have deepened activities in the frequently attacked areas in Zamfara State by armed bandits. There have been intense operations to wipe out the bandits in the state and restore law and order for the safety of inhabitants of the troubled communities.
The acting Force Information Officer of Operation Sharan Daji, Clement Abiade, in a statement, indicated that troops now conduct day and night patrols to stop bandits from operating, and also assure residents of their safety.
The troops arrested a total of 18 suspected bandits’ informants, rustlers, kidnappers and logistics suppliers, a notorious kidnapper who was intercepted in Niger Republic.
The bandits have in the recent time taken over violent crime from the killer Fulani herdsmen in the north to an unimaginable degree that paints a graphic picture of civil war ravaging northern Nigeria.
President Muhamadu Buhari had on return from UAE issued an order to the military to deal ruthlessly with perpetrators of violent crimes in the north.
