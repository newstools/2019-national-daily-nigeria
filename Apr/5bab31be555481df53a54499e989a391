The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has
reiterated its warning of President Muhammadu Buhari not to accept the
advice of the International Monetary Fund that Nigeria should remove
subsidy on petroleum products.
NUPENG National President, Williams Akporeha, in Lagos admonished that
if the federal government succumbs to the advice of the IMF to remove
petrol subsidy, it would destabilize the economy.
NUPENG also cautioned international oil companies to desist from
unfair labour practices.
The oil workers, particularly, complained about Shell Petroleum
Development Company and NLNG. The union protested that the
multinational companies refuse to respect agreement and statutory
provisions and institutions in the country.
“They want workers working in the oil and gas sector to be unionized.
“And the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has asked the National
Salaries, Income and Wages Commission to issue a circular and an
implementation guide for newly approved minimum wage, for workers,”
the NUPENG President declared.
NLC Chairmen in Enugu and Anambra states were said to have promised to
pursue the full implementation of the new minimum wage as soon as the
circular is sent for execution.
