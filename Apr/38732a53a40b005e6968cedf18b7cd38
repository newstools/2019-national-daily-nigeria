Lagos State governor-elect, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has described the governorship candidate of the Alliance for Democracy (AD), Owolabi Salis as a ‘clown’ who is looking for relevance.
 
Recall that Salis and his party had filed a suit at the election Petition Tribunal sitting in Ikeja, asking the tribunal to restrain the Chief Judge of Lagos, Justice Opeyemi Oke, from swearing-in the governor-elect, pending the determination of the petition which was already before it.

In the application, among other allegations, they claimed that Sanwo-Olu had a criminal record in the United States, and that he was of unsound mind.
 
But in his response the governor-elect’s through his spokesman, Gboyega Akosile, lambasted the defeated governorship candidate of Alliance for Democracy (AD), Owolabi Salis, for asking a court to stop his swearing in.
 
He wondered how the AD gov candidate, who failed to even win election in his polling unit, could think he would become governor through the judiciary.
 
“Salis is behaving like a court jester within a political environment. A man who couldn’t win his polling unit but seeks to become Governor through judiciary can only be likened to a court jester.
 
“This is a voyage to nothingness. We won’t even dissipate our energy on him. He is a clown that should be ignored.”
