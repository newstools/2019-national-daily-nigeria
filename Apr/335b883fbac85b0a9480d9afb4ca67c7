The future of Atlético de Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann is still a soap opera in the whole rule. A soap opera that began last year when the French player announced, through a video, that he had decided to remain in the club colchonero, leaving therefore in the lurch to FC Barcelona that aspired to sign him.
Months later, the soap opera is unleashed again despite the fact that Griezmann – after his million dollar renovation – has a contract in force with Atlético. But, yes, with an exit clause that in summer will go from 200 million to 120.
They have returned to sound the drums on the interest of the Barça and the possibility that, now yes, the Frenchman left the Athletic one … whereas in the Madrilenian club they do not stop assuring that the player will not move. Every day rumors arise in one way or another regarding this issue. And on the night of this Tuesday, a new perspective. According to Manu Carreño in his program ‘El Larguero’ of the SER network: “In the Barça squad they do not want Griezmann and the board knows it”.
In the same program, Manu Carreño interviewed Carles Rexach, Barça presidential adviser, who returned to be very direct about the French: “I would not sign Griezmann, it’s Barça style but I did not like that” I’m going, I’m staying ” And, moreover, he plays football where Messi plays. “
