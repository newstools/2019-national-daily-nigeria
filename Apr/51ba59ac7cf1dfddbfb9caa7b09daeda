A German company is trying their absolute best to change whatever perception you have about mobile homes.
In order to purchase this mobile home, you are going to need to have some serious money saved up. The Performance S is the latest mobile home model from Volkner Mobil is going to cost you a cool $1.7 million.

Not only is this the finest mobile home money can buy, but it is essentially a resort on wheels.
The vehicle measures in at 40 feet long, while still remaining sleek and stylish. Occupants receive access to a double bed and a heated bathroom. There is also a very spacious lounge area for you to enjoy. Just in case this motor home isn’t ritzy enough for you, you’ll also have access to a garage that allows you to take your Mercedes or Ferrari along for the trip.

This is the perfect vehicle for those who are looking to take off and enjoy the open road, yet retain access to all of their favorite creature comforts. Those who do not wish to eat out on a regular basis during their journey can make use of the full kitchen. When it comes to finding the best motor home for the truly cultured traveler, accept no substitute.

Most people will simply have to look at the pictures and vicariously live through others. Unless you have about $2 million in the bank that you’re not too closely attached to, of course.
