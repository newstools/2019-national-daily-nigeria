Several concerned citizens thronged to the streets of Abuja protesting the perennial killing and kidnapping of innocent citizens in various parts of Zamfara State by bandits. Accordingly, the protesters who organised themselves in groups marched through the streets of Abuja protesting the increasing rate of armed banditry which include killings, kidnapping for ransom and dispossession property in the state.
The protesters demanded President Muhamamdu Buhari to declare a state of emergency in Zamfara State, end the killings, kidnappings and take adequate care of displaced persons.
However, security personnel, who include the Police and soldiers were said to have prevented the protesters from gaining access to the Presidential Villa to express their anger.
The Commissioner of Police for the Federal Capital Territory, was said to have given attention to the protesters but restrained them from crossing the red line.
