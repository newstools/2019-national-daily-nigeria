Demands restoration of constitutional order

The African Union (AU) has condemned the military coup in Sudan that ousted President Omar Al Bashir from office after days of mass protest in the country. The AU, then, called for restoration of constitutional order in the country without delay.
The spokeswoman said that the Union’s Chairman, Moussa Faki Mahammat, has requested the Peace and Security Council to meet soon and deliberate further on what action to take on Sudan.
In light of international criticism, protesters sustained their mass action, agitating that the Military Council which took over is part of the regime.
Ebba Kalondo, Spokeswoman of the African Union, said: “The African Union would further appeal probably to all stakeholders right now on the ground that more now than ever, it’s time to engage in an inclusive dialogue, to create the conditions that would make it possible to meet the aspirations of the Sudanese people, to form democracy and good governance and restore constitutional order as soon as possible.”
She also spoke on the next consequence for the African Union
Commission: “In terms of the next sequence for the African Union Commission, it’s for the organ on elections, peace and democracy, which is the African Union Peace and Security Council that would need to meet, and then discuss the issue and take the appropriate decisions based on the existing instruments like the Lome 2000 Declaration and the African Charter on Elections, Democracy and Governance.”
