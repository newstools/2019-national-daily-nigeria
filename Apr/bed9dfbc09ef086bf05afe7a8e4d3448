Former Chief Justice of Nigeria Walter Onnoghen has appealed his conviction by the Code of Conduct Tribunal Thursday afternoon for false asset declaration.
The tribunal also ordered that he forfeit the money in the five accounts he failed to declare in his assets declaration form.
That was in addition to the order removing him from office, and banning him from holding public office for the next ten years.
Onnoghen, however, identified 16 grounds warranting his appeal to upturn his conviction.
He also sought seven reliefs from the court including â€œan order setting aside his conviction.
