President Muhammadu Buhari met former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Tuesday for the first time since the 2019 general elections in Senegal.
Buhari and Dr. Obasanjo met in Dakar, Senegal, at the inauguration of President Macky Sall of Senegal. However, both leaders showed no animosity on each other at the meeting even though they had hostile relationship during the 2019 general elections in Nigeria.
Obasanjo sustained constant criticism of President Buhari and is yet to suspend action. The former President supported the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, in the 2019 presidential election against the incumbent.
The inauguration of the Senegalese President drew attendance of African leaders from different parts of the continent, including prominent Nigerians as well as the President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina.
