Super Eagles and CD Leganes defender, Kenneth Omeruo missed the weekend’s big win at title-chasing Getafe after he was suspended on account of accumulated bookings, National Daily gathered.
The 25-year-old central defender picked up his fifth yellow card of the season in his team’s 2-0 home loss to Girona just before the international break.
Before then the S. Eagles defender had made 20 straight starts for his La Liga side, National Daily learnt.
He will now be available for selection for Thursday’s home game against Real Valladolid.
Leganes are now 12th on the La Liga table with 36 points from 29 matches.
