President Muhammadu Buhari at a security meeting at the State House,
Abuja, on Friday, issued marching orders to the service chiefs to deal
ruthlessly with bandits terrorizing Zamfara State and the environs.
The Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonisakin, had stated after the
meeting, that a revised strategy has also been adopted to tackle
banditry in Zamfara State.
The federal government had on Sunday announced the suspension of miningÂ activities in Zamfara State and directed all foreigners to
leave mining sites in the state to enable security operatives to take
control and bring the current security situation in the area under
control.
The Acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on Friday
declared that the Kaduna/Abuja road is now safe for travelers, noting
that the Police have cleared that north west/north central corridor
after intense security operations which led to the arrest of several
members of the criminal gangs intimidating and kidnapping innocent
citizens along the road.
The perennial activities of criminals along the Kaduna/Abuja
expressway degenerated into frequent kidnappings, armed robbery and killings, making the road unsafe for travellers.
IG Adamu remarked that criminals who attempted to resist arrest
suffered serious injuries in engaging the Police in gun battle before
they were overpowered.
