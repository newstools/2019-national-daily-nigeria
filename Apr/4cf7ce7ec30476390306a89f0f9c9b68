The Council for Supreme Sharia in Nigeria at a Ramadan lecture in
Kaduna, Kaduna State, told President Muhammadu Buhari to urgent
overhaul the country’s security architecture in order to arrest the
rising insecurity in the country.
The council had also blamed the security chiefs of the various Armed
Forces and the Police for the current insecurity in the northern
Nigeria that have made life unbearable to citizens.

From the Boko Haram terrorism and warfare in the north east that
turned Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states to war zones, to the north
central where Kogi, Benue, Plateau and Nasarawa states were turned
into slaughter entities of killer herdsmen, to the north west where
Katsina, Zamfara and Jigawa states have become huge markets for
bandits, northern Nigeria has been under siege. The high tempo of
bloodshed in the northern states in addition to the inter-communal
warfare, including killings and kidnappings in southern Kaduna, the
terror on the Abuja/Kaduna corridor, have all assumed the status of
civil war in the north.
