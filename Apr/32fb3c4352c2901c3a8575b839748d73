The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Sokoto State has restated its commitment to checkmate hoarding, diversion and selling of petroleum products above the control price.
Mr Muhammad Makera, the Zonal Operation Controller in-charge of Sokoto and Kebbi States, made this pledge in an interview.
Makera said the department would continue to intensify its surveillance on illegal petroleum activities.
He said that he had led officials on a monitoring exercise to fuel stations in Sokoto and Kebbi States, noting that from Sunday, no fewer than six petrol stations were sealed off for various offences.
The controller said that no fewer than 20 trucks were supplied to Sokoto State out of which 12 were for Sokoto metropolis.
“There is no need of panic buying which may have resulted in the queues noticed in some petrol stations.
