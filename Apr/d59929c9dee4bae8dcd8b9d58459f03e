The Nigerian Army has commenced military operations to tame the high frequency of armed banditry in Zamfara State.
The military operations tagged: “Harbin Kunama”, would be extended to higher operations that may require massive deployment of troops and equipment to areas where bandits have been feasting on innocent citizens.
Several communities in Zamfara and neighboring states of Katsina and Sokoto have been under siege of incessant attacks by bandits who rob, kidnap, kill and plunder the inhabitants.
The Army military operations – “Harbin Kunama” – was planned to commence June but was began in April to combat the increasing activities of the bandits.
The military operation will complement the current “Operation Sharan Daji”, being expanded to massive deployment of troops to isolated communities and operations in forests that have become safe haven for the bandits.
The military operation will co-exist with the air surveillance commenced by the Nigerian Air Force in Zamfara State.
