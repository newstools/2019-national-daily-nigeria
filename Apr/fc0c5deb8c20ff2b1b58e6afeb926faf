Reporter’s view (Ediale Kingsley, nationaldailyng.com):

Who has the edge in tonight’s cracker? Ajax’s Amsterdam managed to draw the Cristiano Ronaldo led Juventus in the first leg. So there’s the away goal advantage already for Juve. while many people believe the real danger is CR7 (having scored 24 goals in 21 quarter-final games) I do believe the player to be feared the most in Juve is Bernardeschi.  So yeah, Juventus have the benefit of an away goal, but know better than to take Real Madrid’s vanquishers lightly.

Key battle
Ronaldo v De Ligt: Matthijs de Ligt gave another solid showing in the first leg but could not prevent Ronaldo scoring with his first real opening. “Ronaldo is a predator in the box,” the 19-year-old centre-back said. “He sees an opportunity, just a tiny gap, and he is on it incredibly quickly.” De Ligt is a fast learner; if he can keep CR7 quiet for 90 minutes, Ajax will have a much bigger chance of reaching the last four.
