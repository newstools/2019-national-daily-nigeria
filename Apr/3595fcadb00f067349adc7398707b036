The Nigeria Customs Service Wednesday began the process of recruiting about 3,200 personnel to fill existing vacancies within the agency.
The acting Deputy Comptroller General (DCG), Human Resources Development, Sanusi Umar, Tuesday in a briefing said the recruitment exercise got the approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and is in compliance with requirements of the Federal Character Commission (FCC).
He said the recruitment will be conducted to fill 800 spaces in the Support Staff for Superintendent Cadre category, while the remaining 2,400 slots will be for Customs Inspector and Customs Assistant Cadre in the General Duty category.

To properly inform the public, Umar said a web portal for applications has been created as a sub-domain of the NCS website.
He noted that the job portal will be opened for three weeks.
“We are determined to conduct an exercise that is credible, fair and transparent. We will deploy all machineries within our powers to ensure that the integrity of the exercise is not compromised,” Umar said.
He warned members of the public to beware of fraudsters and criminals who may be operating illegal sites and portals and collect money from applicants.
“I want to reiterate that the portal for this exercise can only be accessed through the official service website where NO FEES will be demanded,” Ali noted.
