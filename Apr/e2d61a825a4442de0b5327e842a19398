Hugo Lloris made another very costly error against Liverpool on Sunday, and it feels like he has let Tottenham down too many times, National Daily gathered.
Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino can be so proud of his side, because they dominated the second half at Anfield and they should have won the game.
Instead they lost, because Lloris had a shocker when he tried to deal with Mohamed Salah’s header. It was just not acceptable and in the situation Spurs are in, chasing a top-four place, they needed better from their captain.
You cannot legislate for mistakes like that from your goalkeeper, but Lloris has been making them for a couple of seasons now.
What is in the 32-year-old’s favour is that he is still making some world class saves – away at Borussia Dortmund at the start of March, for example, when I don’t think Spurs would have got through that Champions League tie without some of the early stops he made.
But unfortunately the top goalkeepers are judged on consistency and being solid, so the rest of the team can look behind them and think “we are going to be fine”.
