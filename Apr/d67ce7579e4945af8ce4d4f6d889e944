Some traders attributed the price increase to the season and transportation.
Alhaji Haruna Mohammed, Leader of  Mile 12 Traders Association, told NAN that price of perishable food items, especially tomatoes was relatively cheap and stable despite the fact that it was their off-season.
“This time last year, a basket of tomatoes was sold for N10, 000, but this year, people are benefiting from reduced price due to high cultivation by farmers,” he said.
Mohammed urged government to continue with its various interventions in agriculture to make prices of food items affordable and available in the market.
