Although Simeone does not agree with the intention of his club to place Diego Costa in the market and has publicly stated that he has him for next season, the reality is that in the highest levels of the club rojiblanco have already tired of the reactions of his striker and the damage that they entail for the team and his intention is none other than to sell the player to the highest bidder, if it exists.
The exit operation will not be easy. Quite the opposite. It seems difficult for the player’s high record, close to 10 million net, for his age, 30 years, and because the club is well aware that the investment made by the player in September 2017 (contract until 2021) is not minimally amortized from the financial point of view.

Let’s not talk about the sport, in which the performance of Costa has been far from expected and nothing to do with the one developed in its previous stage.
Atlético paid Chelsea 55 million, plus 10 in variables, which fortunately for the entity have almost not been met. Nowadays it is complicated that its market price approaches even that amount. Their poor performance and attitude have devalued their value.
