Palpable tension grip residents of the city of Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State, as the Independent National Electoral Commission resumed collation of the governorship election results in Rivers State at the Commissionâ€™s state headquarters in Port Harcourt on Tuesday.
INEC had directed the resumption of collation and declaration of the March 9 governorship election results, after considering reports submitted to the INEC Headquarters, Abuja, by the Returning and Electoral Officers on the obstruction of the electoral process in Rivers State which led to the declaration of the March 0 elections inconclusive by the commission.
The commission insisted on resumption and completion of collation of results and announcing the winner, rejecting calls for supplementary elections in some local governments.
It was gathered that results of Port Harcourt and Ikwerre Local Governments have now been announced while the commission said results from 17 local government areas will be declared subsequently.
INEC Officials presiding over the collation and announcement of results include some national commissioners, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Obo Effanga, and security agencies led by the Commissioner of Police, Usman Belel.
the Port Harcourt-Aba expressway around the INEC office has been sealed off by security operatives to forestall access by hoodlums into the premises.
