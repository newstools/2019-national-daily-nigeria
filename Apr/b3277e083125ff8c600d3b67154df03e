The British High Commissioner to Nigeria has met with the Senate Leader and frontline candidate for the Senate President seat, Senator Ahmed Lawan, to discuss an agenda for the 9th Assembly.
The UK High Commission said on its official Facebook page that Catriona Laing met with the Senate Leader to discuss police, oil sector and electoral reform.
“Good to meet Senator Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan and discuss priorities for the 9th Assembly. The NASS has a busy legislative agenda coming up including electoral, petroleum and police reform bills- Catriona Laing, British High Commissioner to Nigeria,” the post read.
The meeting between the two was seen as an endorsement of Lawan by Britain.
The Yobe senator has also been endorsed by the All Progressives Congress.
