The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has joined other Nigerians to condemn the series of hardships facing Nigerians under the Buhari-led administration in the last four years.
Are Adams who spoke at the 2nd annual Public Lecture of Freedom Online in Lagos said from all indications, the present situation in the country shows that majority of Nigerians are suffering, with little or no hope.
The event also attended by presidential spokesman, Femi Adeshina, saw the OPC leaders advising the president to address some critical issues affecting Nigerians because the people are bleeding.

He said the event was a good opportunity for him to tell the President through his spokesman, that he needs to concentrate on programmes that have direct impact on the lives of the people at the grassroots.
“My brother, Mr. Femi Adesina has raised some issues on the state of the nation, he is doing his job. However, I want you to tell the President that Nigeria is bleeding. From my experience so far, I think President Buhari needs to attend to some critical issues that need urgent attention. Let me use my personal experience to buttress my point. I spend over N13, 000 daily on diesel to fuel my generating set.
“And that is the situation across the country. That shows the power sector is not working. Another area that the president needs to work on is the agricultural sector. The facts and figures show that we still have a long way to go if Nigeria is to be ranked among the most vibrant countries in the world. From all indices, it is no doubt that our economy needs total overhauling. Though, we have exited recession as claimed by Mr. Adesina, efforts should also be made to revamp the economy,” Adams said.
