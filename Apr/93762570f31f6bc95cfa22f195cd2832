Four people have been reportedly killed on Tuesday when a moving train ran over a tricycle along Iju-Fagba corridor of the railway line in Lagos State.
The Lagos District Superintendent, Mr. Christian Madza, confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria.
Madza said the tricycle, popularly called Keke Napep, was trying to outsmart the moving train when the train ran over it at the railway level crossing.
“That is what we have been repeating every time, don’t play too smart on rain line because the train has its right of way,’ he said.
According to him, four people were killed, while one person was injured in the accident.
The District Superintendent urged motorists to always obey signs and signals at various level crossings to avoid such accident in the future.
“Motorists and passersby always refuse to obey the signs and signals at railway level crossings.
“We appeal to them to be cognizant of these signs and for passerby to keep away from railway lines,” he added.
