A leading transportation company in Nigeria, E. Ekesons Bros. had through its legal counsel, Festus Keyamo Chambers, urged the Federal Capital Territory High Court, to send Adamu Candido, Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, (AMAC); Lawrence Val Onuchukwu, Vice Chairman, AMAC; and Halidu Adamu, Secretary, AMAC; to Prisons, for disobeying Court Order.
The Festus Keyamo Chambers in a statement at the weekend narrated that on 2nd October, 2015, the FCT High Court delivered Judgment in favor of E. EKESONS Bros. Nigeria Limited, against the Abuja Municipal Area Council, (AMAC), wherein the Court held that the agreement between the parties, for E. EKESONS Bros. Nigeria Limited to develop and manage the Jabi/Utako Motor Park, is still subsisting and binding. The Court also ordered AMAC to comply and/or abide by the terms of the said agreement.
The legal counsel remarked that since the Judgment was delivered, the Principal Officers of AMAC, specifically Adamu Candido, Chairman; lawrence Val Onuchukwu, Vice Chairman; and Halidu Adamu, Secretary, have continuously disobeyed the Judgment by allocating certain portions of the Jabi/Utako Motor Park to some persons who have proceeded to erect structures on same, contrary to the terms of the agreement, as affirmed by the Court.
The Counsel noted that consequently, E. EKESONS Bros. Nigeria Limited filed contempt proceedings against the Principal Officers of AMAC, urging the Court to commit them to prisons.
