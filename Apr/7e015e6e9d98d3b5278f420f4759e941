The bears remained on rampage on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) with the All-Share Index dropping below 30,000 mark due to persistent sell pressure. The index lost, in spite of improved earnings reports, 558.04 points or 1.85 per cent to close at 29,668.73 compared with 30,226.77 recorded on Tuesday.
Also, the market capitalisation shed N210 billion or 1.85 per cent in six hours to close at N11.143 trillion against N11.353 trillion achieved on Tuesday. Ambrose Omordion, chief operating officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the persistent lull to low confidence and liquidity in the stock market.
Omordion said that ongoing volatility would continue as investors and fund managers re-balance their portfolios, with eyes fixed on political space and ongoing full year company earnings position and post-election market dynamics. He said that investors should review their positions in line with their investment goals, strength of the company numbers and act as events unfold in the global and domestic environment.
“Investors look to government’s policy direction as the market faces low liquidity problems in the ongoing earnings reporting season, vis-à-vis, market and economic fundamentals.
“Given the drop in the prices of major blue chips in recent times, creating entry opportunities, we expect speculative trading to shape the market direction going forward,” Omordion said. He said that investors should go for equities with intrinsic value and allow numbers guide their decisions, while repositioning in any stock, especially now that stock prices remained low in the midst of mixed company numbers,
weak economic and market fundamentals.
