Arsenal supporters will be safeguarded by a team of 800 police officers during their Europa League clash in Napoli, it has been revealed.
Authorities in Italy have taken the steps to ensure the safety of fans travelling from the UK, following a series of high profile incidents involving Gli Azzurri fans.
According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, via Sports Witness, there is a strong fear over the ‘presence of holligans’ and as a result a police presence will be reinforced.
Arsenal fans will also be made to make their way to the stadium by buses provided, with all fans urged to make their way to the ‘Maritime Station’ ahead of a police escort to the ground.
There is a history of English fans being targeted by local supporters in Naples.
Three Manchester City fans were ambushed and injured during an attack by Ultras at a restaurant in 2017, while a Liverpool fan was also hurt on their visit to the Stadio San Paolo earlier this season.
In February, Napoli fans were also involved in clashes with Zurich supporters in Switzerland ahead of their Round of 32 clash.
And in December last year, an Inter supporter was killed during clashes with Napoli fans not far from the San Siro.
Ten mini-vans carrying away supporters slipped past police checks and were confronted by around 100 Inter supporters carrying sticks and other weapons.
Daniele Belardinelli, aged 35, was knocked down in the ensuing melee, and later died in hospital.
Arsenal are not the only British side facing safety concerns this week ahead of European ties.
Manchester United have sent out special observers to keep an eye on police measures taken when their 4,500 descend on Barcelona.
Last season, Chelsea reported of heavy-handed tactics from police outside the stadium as fans waited to get through security lanes.
Both the FA and UEFA will also have representatives looking for improvements on the process, after the Spanish club increased the number of search lanes to ease congestion.
