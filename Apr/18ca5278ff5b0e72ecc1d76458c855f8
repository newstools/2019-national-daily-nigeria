The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC today released the former 2nd Vice-President of Nigerian Bar Association, NBA Monday Ubani after 24 days in detention.

Ubani was arrested and detained on March 19, along with Senator Christopher Ania for failing to produce the former Managing Director of Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, NSITF, Mrs Ngozi Olejeme who the both stood for as sureties. Olojeme is facing an N6.4billion fraud charge preferred against her by the EFCC.

Ubani had maintained his innocence over Olejeme’s disappearance insisting that she absconded after the EFCC raided her home.

He also stated that his decision to stand surety for Olejeme was because he compelled her to return to Nigeria to face the charges against her and all effort to secure her bail was frustrated by the EFCC.

Since Ubani’s arrest, there has been a massive public outcry for his release especially after a Federal High Court order that EFCC should either release him or charge him to court. Several Civil Rights Organizations, Senior Lawyers and very prominent Nigerians mounted pressure on the EFCC to release Ubani.
