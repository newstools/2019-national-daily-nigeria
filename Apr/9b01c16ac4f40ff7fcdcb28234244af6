The Kogi state government has said it has paid 38 months salaries to workers since it came into office in January 2016. The government made the clarification through Kingsley Fanwo, the director general of media and publicity to Governor Yahaya Bello.
 
It was gathered that Fanwo, who briefed journalists after an All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders’ meeting in Mopamuro local government area of the state, said the government is owing four months salaries.
 
Fanwo said: “One of the questions our party members asked during the meeting was about the claim by labour that we are owing workers 38 months’ salaries.

“As far as the government is concerned, we have paid 38 months’ salaries starting from September 2015. We have been in office for just 39 months.
 
But we are still owing four months’ salaries because we started paying from the period when we were yet to assume power. “We are not in any power play with labour. We will continue to appreciate their understanding and we pledge to clear all the arrears as soon as possible.
 
“We know how pivotal salaries are to microeconomics and we also know we owe other sectors of the public a good number of social amenities. Government will continue to manage the contending interests to serve a good number of the population.
