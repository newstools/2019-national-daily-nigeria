The All Progressives Congress in Abia on Sunday formally endorsed  Orji Kalu, the Senator-elect for Abia North Senatorial District, for the post of Deputy Senate President in the 9th National Assembly (NASS).
The endorsement took place at Camp Neya, the country home of Kalu in Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of Abia.
The state chapter of the party also endorsed Nkiru Onyejeocha, representing Isuikwuato/Umunneochi Federal Constituency, for the Speakership of the House of Representatives.
The endorsement followed a motion moved at the meeting by Sen. Chris Adighije, the Abia APC caucus leader.
While the party’s National Working Committee has yet to endorse any senator the deputy Senate presidency. the party is clear on whom it wants as Speaker–Majority Leader Femi Gbjabiamila.
Onyejeocha, who would be making her fourth term in NASS, formally announced her ambition to run for the Speakership of the House.
Adighije, who represented Abia central from 2003-2007, promised to reach out to his friends in the Senate and House of Representatives to solicit their votes for the candidates.
Onyejeocha spoke of the need for the party members to join the struggle for Ndigbo to produce the next Nigeria’s president in 2023.
“We need to produce the next president of Nigeria so that our fortunes will change,” she said.
