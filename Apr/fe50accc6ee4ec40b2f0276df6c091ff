INEC’s Head of Voter Education and Publicity in Plateau State, Mr. Osareti Imahiyereobo, disclosed this in his goodwill message during a Town Hall Meeting organised by the Search For Common Ground, a non-governmental organisation.
“The closure of all our borders has greatly affected the economic growth of the nation, as all businesses are also always on standstill till after elections.
“This very action is mainly due to the lack of trust among us Nigerians and which is not good for us as a nation, given its negative effects on our economy because businesses are always closed down.
“In some other nations like Zambia, borders and business premises are left open while some sensitive materials like ballot papers are always sent out to voters week before elections and their elections were not affected in any way.
“But that kind of trust and understanding can’t happen here because we as Nigerians do not trust ourselves, ’’ he said.
