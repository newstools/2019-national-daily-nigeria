The Supreme Court, on Wednesday upheld the election of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State in the 2018 governorship poll. The apex court set aside the suit filed by Chief Segun Oni challenging the nomination of Fayemi as APC candidate for governorship election in Ekiti, for incompetence.
Oni in the suit argued that Fayemi was not eligible to run as the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate having not resigned as Minister of Mines and Steel Development 30 days before the party’s primary election.

The former Ekiti Governor who came second in the APC governorship primary also contended that Fayemi shouldn’t have contested on the strength of an indictment by a Judicial Commission of Inquiry set up by former Governor Ayo Fayose.
The Panel’s White Paper which indicted Fayemi and banned him from office for 10 years has been quashed by a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court.
