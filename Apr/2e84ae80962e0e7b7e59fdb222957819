An entire  police team in Lagos has been arrested over the alleged killing of a youth, Kolade Johnson on Sunday.
The state command’s spokesman, DSP Bala Elkana, confirmed the arrest in a statement on Monday.
On Sunday that some residents of Mangoro/Onipetesi community in Lagos went on a rampage blocking the Oshodi/Abeokuta expressway in protest against the killing of a youth in the area.
The angry residents blocked the major roads with tyres and woods after the youth, later identified as Kolade Johnson was shot dead by policemen from Anti-Cultism Unit of Lagos State Command.
An unmarked commercial bus occupied by the policemen had visited the community on Sunday afternoon in search of youths dressed wildly and wearing dreadlocks.

He said the shooting was done by a team of policemen from Anti Cultism unit, stressing that a team of policemen from the Rapid Response Squads and Metro Patrol were promptly drafted to the scene.

“Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, CP Zubairu Muazu calls for calm, assuring that justice will prevail in this case.
“The CP also condoles with the family, friends and well wishers of Kolade Johnson,” he said.
