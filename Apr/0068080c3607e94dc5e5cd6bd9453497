The north central Elders Forum in Tuesday demanded the leadership of the All Progressive Congress (APC) to zone the Speaker of the House of Representatives for the Ninth National Assembly to the zone.
The Elders Forum in Abuja was of the view that the zone is too strategic to be relegated in the power sharing equation of the new dispensation in Nigeria. They argued that since the North West has taken the president, the south west the vice president while the north east is already fighting for the senate president, it will be appropriate that the speaker be zoned to the north central to balance the power equation of Nigeria in the ruling APC.
Record shows that since the return of democracy in Nigeria in 1999, the north central has never produced a presiding officer in the House of Representatives, though the zone had dominated the senate president in the upper chamber of the National Assembly.
In the new arrangement after the 2019 general elections, leaders from the north central are making strong case for the Speaker of the House of Representatives to come from the zone.
Invariably, the north central APC caucus would be sponsoring a candidate for the Speaker of the House to challenge Femi Gbajabiamila, house Majority Leader who has already declared for the race. With his candidature, the south west will be taking advantage of having the vice president and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, which will be double share of power in the APC government.
