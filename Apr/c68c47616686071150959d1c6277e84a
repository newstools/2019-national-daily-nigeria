Police Prosecutor, Inspector Peter Ogbe, informed the court that Abdullahi had unlawful carnal knowledge with the victim on February 8th and 9th, 2019 at Aduwawa Quarters in Ikpoba-Okha local government area.

Inspector Ogbe said the offence is punishable under Section 218 of the Criminal Code Cap 48Â  Vol II Laws of the defunct Bendel State now applicable in Edo State.

Abdullahi pleaded guilty to the charge.

Ibrahim told the court he opted to leave vengeance for God.

Presiding Magistrate, D.I Adamaigbo, cautioned the accused person to stop lying by insisting he did not sleep with the victim.

Adamaigbo warned Abdullahi to desist from the act as he was lucky that the victim decided not to press
charges.
