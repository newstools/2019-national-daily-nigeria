No fewer than 25 soldiers and police officers have been arrested in connection with the killing of the IGP Intelligence Response Team members that went to arrest a kidnap kingpin Hamisu Wadume in Taraba weeks ago.
The Joint Investigation Committee, set up by the Defence Headquarters on the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the killing of the police officers, sits to question representatives of the police and the military in Taraba today.
Wadume, sources say, used the arrested soldiers and police officers to gather information on the movement and location and financial capacity of his potential victims.
All these were pieced together by investigators who tracked phone conversations with Wadume.
With the military-police-kidnapper network, the suspect has been able to shake off every effort of law enforcement to bust him.
The higher-ups from the army and the police would also meet with the investigative panel Friday.
The Joint Investigation Panel is headed by Rear Admiral IT Olaiya, a former Director of Naval Intelligence.
Members of the panel include representative each from the Nigerian Army, Navy, Air Force, the Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Service, DSS, and the Defence Intelligence Agency, DIA.
The unfortunate incident between the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police allegedly resulting in the killing of three personnel of the Nigeria Police and   a civilian took place along Ibi-Wukari road in Taraba State.
Among those the soldiers killed in the course of rescuing their paymaster were ASP Felix Adolije, who led the team; Inspector Mark Ediale; Sergeants Usman Danzumi and Dahiru Musa as well as a civilian, Olajide Owolabi.
