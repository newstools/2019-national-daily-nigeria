A presidential aide who was excited over her appointment so much she went to share her testimony in popular church in Nigeria has had her fortune reversed: she got a sack.
Edna Kargbo gave her testimony at the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Lagos.
Displaying photos of her appointment letter and all the perks that came with to the crowd in the church, Kargbo said God has been good to her since she was appointed.
“I want to thank God for blessing me with this job as SCOP to the president of Sierra Leone, ambassador at large and the blessings that come with it. If you look closely at this picture you will see my luxurious house God has blessed me with. I was living in a single room apartment. But my story is now different,” she said on Emmanuel TV, the church broadcast network.
Kargbo was appointed state chief protocol to Serra Leonean President Julius Bio.
An International news agency reported the Sierra Leonean public has been discussing the issue with frustration, following the austerity the government says it’s battling with.
A letter by the Office of the Sierra Leonean President reads, “The official has been relieved of her duties following a testimony she gave in a Nigerian church. Further administrative investigations will be carried out.”
Also, in a press release on Wednesday, Sierra Leone’s Anti-Corruption Commission said Kargbo is being investigated.
The commission has opened an official investigation into the conduct of the official and her testimony. 
“We will also look at her source of wealth in acquiring her house and other properties. If it contradicts the anti-corruption act or we find instances of unexplained wealth, she will be charged to court and will be asked to pay a fine,” the release said.
