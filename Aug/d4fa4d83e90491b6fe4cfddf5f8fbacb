Recall that National Daily reported that the Director General of the National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe threatened to deal with Nigerian male barbie, Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju popularly known as Bobrisky.
Runsewe in an interview with Vanguard last week, vowed to deal with the cross dresser, who he called “a national disgrace.”

In his response which was posted on Instablog, Bobrisky said “Ï heard someone in government talked about me a few days ago. Please tell him I’m waiting for him. It’s then he will know that I roll with his bosses in government, not someone at his level.
So he left serious issues in Nigeria to address Bobrisky. But I popular sha…”
