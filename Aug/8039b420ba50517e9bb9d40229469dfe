Liverpool snubbed Pepe Reina to sign Adrian as their new back-up goalkeeper.

Former West Ham keeper Adrian joined the Reds on Monday following Simon Mignolet’s transfer to Club Brugge, with the Spaniard to provide cover for No.1 Alisson.

However, according to The Athletic, Reina was eyeing a move back to Anfield before Liverpool decided to sign Adrian instead.

Reina spent eight years playing for Liverpool before leaving on a permanent move to Bayern Munich in 2014.

Also, in other news, Liverpool could sign Dorukhan Tokoz before the transfer window closes on Thursday.

The Reds completed their third summer signing earlier this week with goalkeeper Adrian arriving at Anfield, and a fourth arrival could come through the door.

Also, in the news, Danny Murphy says Liverpool fans were ‘disrespectful’ by booing the national anthem before their Community Shield defeat to Manchester City on Sunday.

However, the former Reds midfielder also believes the tradition is ‘pointless’ for cup finals where the majority of the players on the pitch aren’t even English.
