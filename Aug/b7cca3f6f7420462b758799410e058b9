Mario Mandzukic deal called off
Reports reaching National Daily have that the Old Trafford side will not pursue a Deadline Day move for Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic.
United had reopened talks with Juventus for the Croatia international in a bid to sign a replacement for Romelu Lukaku with Inter Milan close to completing a deal for Lukaku after a £73m deal was agreed between both clubs. The Belgium striker is currently in Milan to undergo a scheduled medical.
Everton are in talks with Manchester United to sign Marcos Rojo on a permanent deal.
With Kurt Zouma’s return to Chelsea after his season-long loan coupled with Ashley Williams and Phil Jagielka’s release, Everton are on the lookout for another centre-back after seeing Man United reject their loan bid for Chris Smalling.
The Toffees are considering the opportunity to bring Rojo to Goodison Park before the deadline.
Marcos Silva sees the 29 years old Argentine as potential replacement for Zouma after their attempt to bring him in fell through last summer.
The Argentine was at United’s Carrington training ground on Thursday morning along with one of his representatives and held talks with United over his future at the club.
He last played for them in the 1-1 draw against Chelsea in April and featured only six times in total last season.
Rojo has two years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford with the option to extend his deal by a further year.
