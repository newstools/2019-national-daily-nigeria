The party also commended the State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, for his commitment and determination to rid the state of crime and ensure peace and normalcy in all nook and crannies.

“His swift intervention and plea to President Muhammadu Buhari to which the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) responded by providing a helicopter that had since remained in Ogun and had helped in rescuing the victims at Ogunmakin and Ogbere,” the statement said.

The party also commended the IGP for his decision to set up a Special Task Force in Ogun.

“Security is the responsibility of all, rather than rivalry, there should be increased sharing of intelligence and synergy between security and paramilitary agencies, as only this would ensure efficient and effective combat of crimes in our society.

“We endorse the recently expressed intention of the governor, to relaunch, reactivate and reenergize the Ogun Security Trust Fund and urge him not to leave any stone unturned in order to make the state very safe for residents and travelers.

“We urge the police and other security agencies not to rest on their oars. Security of lives and property demands eternal vigilance,” it added.
