The DSS has taken the AAC ex-candidate Omoyele Sowore to court for an order to hold him in detention for 90 days when investigation of treason allegation against him will end.
So an Abuja Federal High Court will, on Thursday, rule in the application filed by the agency.
In an exparte order with number FHC/ABJ/CS/915/19, Counsel to the DSS, G. O. Agbadua, told Justice Taiwo Taiwo that a video clip evidence was also attached to the application.
He urged the judge to grant the application seeking to detain Sowore beyond the 48 hours the law provides for.
Justice Taiwo, who adjourned the matter until Aug. 8, said the development was to enable him watch the video clip before delivering his ruling.
DSS had arrested SoworeÂ over the weekend after he called for a nationwide protest he tagged Revolution Now.
Many have condemned his arrest.
