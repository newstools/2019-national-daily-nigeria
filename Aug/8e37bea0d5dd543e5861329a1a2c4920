Thereafter, they were said to have ordered them to exit their community.

A Federal High Court in Lagos had last week ordered that three bank accounts allegedly linked to the former Lagos State Governor with N9.9 billion deposit be frozen, as the judge gave ruling on an ex parte application by EFCC.
Former Governor Ambode had denied ownership of the said accounts, saying he has no personal links to the accounts.
