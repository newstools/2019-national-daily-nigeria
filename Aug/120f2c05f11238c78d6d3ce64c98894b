NEROS Sports Stadium Nanka, Anambra State will host the 3rd edition of the South East /South South preseason tournament “THE PRESEASON CUP”. The tournament which is meant to prepare teams for the new season will hold from 20th to 27th August 2019.
National  Daily learnt that the Coordinator of the Program, Patrick Ngwaogu, invitation letters have been sent to the expected premiership clubs in the South East and South South zones of the country, and teams from other zones.

“we are having teams like Abia warriors, Akwa United, Rivers United,  Heartland FC, Delta Force, Warri Wolves, Akwa Starlets, Akwa United, FC Ifeanyi Ubah among others. We are also giving opportunities to lower clubs to exhibit and show their skills in the tournament. We would be having the likes of Cynosure FC, who incidentally are the defending Champions, Udala FC, Aspire FC, Giant Brillas, SKE FC.” He said the tournament is purely on first come, first serve basis.
Ngwaogu was full of appreciation to the various collaborators that are facilitating the hosting of the tournament.
