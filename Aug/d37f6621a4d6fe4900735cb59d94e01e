Chelsea fans have endured some difficult moments ahead of the current season and even so far this season when the club was handed a transfer ban ahead of the season.
The Blues anguish continued when they surrendered the UEFA Super cup to Liverpool after the penalty shoot-out last week.
Chelsea have also been victims of injuries set back as they missed Hudson-Odoi’s energy in attack after their 4-0 defeat by Manchester United in their opening game and then playing out a frustrating 1-1 draw with Leicester City last Sunday. Hudson-Odoi was not due to return to action before October.
Attention now turns to Chelsea’s match at Norwich City on Saturday afternoon as Frank Lampard looks to register his first win as head coach.
National Daily gathered that happy moments seem to be resurfacing at Stamford Bridge with Callum Hudson-Odoi handing Frank Lampard a surprise injury boost after returning to training early. The forward was one of Chelsea’s stand-out stars last season, but has missed the start of the new campaign due to a Achilles tendon injury he suffered last April.
Meanwhile, it is not that Chelsea have played badly at all in their first few games under Lampard, the team have just been unlucky as they could have quite easily won both games on another day.
Another good news for Chelsea fans is the fact that Rudiger who hobbled off against Manchester United in April due to a meniscus injury and subsequently going under the knife to correct the problem could potentially return to the Chelsea squad in Norfolk after playing the full 90 minutes for the development squad in their Premier League 2 clash against Liverpool on Monday evening.
