The RevolutionNow protesters on Monday defied the warning of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, against any form of protest under the banner of RevolutionNow.

Recall that IGP Adamu, had in a Sunday statement described the planned protest as a call that amounts to “treasonable felony and acts of terrorism”.

He warned the organisers, sponsors, allies, supporters, associates and sympathisers of the protest to desist from embarking on it.

Despite his warning, protesters showed up for a demonstration at the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos, on Monday, chanting revolution songs.

They were met with dozens of police officers blocking off the entrance of the stadium in a bid to shut down the protest.

The protesters also demanded the release of Omoyele Sowore, the convener of the protest who was arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) on Saturday, August 3.

The DSS and the Federal Government accused Sowore, a candidate in February’s presidential election, of plotting to forcefully overthrow the government.

Shortly after the commencement of the protest, officers started firing tear gas canisters to disperse the handful of defiant protesters.

Some of the protesters were injured in the chaos that ensued, while some were also arrested by police officers.

The RevolutionNow protest is a nationwide demonstration against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government that was re-elected in February.
