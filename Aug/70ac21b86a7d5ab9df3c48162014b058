The Inspector-General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, on Thursday gave marching orders to the Commissioner of Police, Taraba State Command, to fish-out the killers of Rev. Father David Tanko who was gruesomely murdered in the most inhuman and barbaric manner by unknown persons in the early hours of Thursday at Kpankufu Village along Wukari Road on his way to Kofai Amadu Village in Taraba State.
The IGP condole the Catholic Family in Nigeria over the unfortunate incident. He also expressed deep concerns over the recent incidents of attacks on clergymen in some parts of the country and, accordingly,  directed Commissioners of Police in all the States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to, henceforth, pay special attention to the clergy and increase security around worship centres nationwide. The IGP further directed the DIG in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) to provide additional forensic and other investigative assets to the Taraba State Command to aid investigations into the incident.
Meanwhile, the IGP enjoined the people to be calm and give maximum support to the Police in the bid towards unravelling the authors of the crime, their motives and circumstances surrounding the unfortunate killing of the Priest. He reassured the Nigerians that the perpetrator(s) of the dastardly act will not go undetected and unpunished.
