As FG condemns live sex

The Big Brother Naija (BBN) may be recording first casualty in the 2019 edition as one of the contestants said to be found on video having live sex with another contestant.
It was gathered that the contestant, Khafilat Kareem, aka Kharfi (29), was recorded in a video allegedly having sex with another housemate, Ekpata Gedoni, 31.
Khafilat Kareem was earlier identified as a staff of the Metropolitan Police Force, the United Kingdom (UK) but the Force was said to have denied being aware that she is participating in the reality show. Apparently, the ethical misconduct seemed to compound the initial case of not having the permission or authority of the UK Metropolitan Police to participate in the competition. This degenerate into the innuendo that she may be dismissed from service on return to the UK.
She was said to have joined the force as a PC based at Lambeth station in 2015 after she worked part-time as a special constable for four years.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government had at the weekend protested the live sex on stage being relayed to television viewers in Nigeria and across the world. The government had on Friday questioned the National Broadcasting Commission on its power of censorship in checking immoral broadcasts, such as the live sex on stage during the 2019 reality show – #Big Brother Naija.
Report indicated that the government acknowledged negotiations with Startimes to modify the BBN to reflect the Nigerian culture, including the eating of Nigerian food and use of Nigerian dresses on the show.
