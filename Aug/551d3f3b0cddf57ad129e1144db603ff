The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division, Nigerian Army,  Maj Gen Olu Irefin has called on officers and men participating in the ongoing joint border security exercise Codenamed: “Ex-SWIFT RESPONSE” to be professional in carrying out their assigned responsibilities.

The exercise which is taking place in four Geo-political zones of South-South; South-West; North-Central and North-West is geared towards addressing transborder security challenges, such as terrorism, armed banditry, smuggling, proliferation of small arms and light weapons among others.

The GOC who addressed the soldiers at the 9 Brigade, Ikeja Cantonment during a familiarisation visit to the Brigade, enjoined them to stand fair, firm and endeavour to do the right thing appropriately.

Gen Irefin, however, warned that the Nigerian Army would not condone any act of indiscipline from any personnel during the exercise.

Earlier, Maj Gen Irefin was received at the Headquarters, 9 Brigade, by the Commander, Brig Gen Musa Etsu-Ndagi, where he was briefed on the activities, achievements and challenges of the Brigade.

The GOC, as part of his tour, inspected Ikeja Army Cantonment facilities where he promised to take the welfare of troops as paramount.

Gen Irefin recently took over command as the General Officer Commanding, 81 Division, Nigerian Army.
