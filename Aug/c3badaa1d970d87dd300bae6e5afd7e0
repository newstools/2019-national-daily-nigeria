There are insinuations that President Muhammadu Buhari may have rejected the untimely retirement from service of the Head of Service of the Civil Service of the Federation, Winifred Oyo-Ita, who has been under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations of N3 billion contract scandal. Report indicated that the Presidency had directed the Head of Service to withhold her retirement, perhaps, pending the conclusion of the investigation.
Oyo-Ita was said to have been absent at the two-day retreat for the new ministers in Abuja even when she was one of the resource persons.
She was said to, however, be present at the swearing in of the ministers last week.
Report further indicated that Oyo-Ita sat close to the Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari, during the inauguration of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) by President Buhari for his second tenure.
The Head of Service was said to have earlier visited the Chief of Staff in his office.
Meanwhile, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, was said to have refuted the receipt of retirement notice from the Head of Service. “Our position in the Villa hasn’t changed. We, I mean the right office to deal with matters like that, hasn’t received any letter of resignation of the sort people are talking about,” he was cited to have said.
