The Presidency has declared that the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has had nothing to do with President Muhammadu Buhari since his arrival in Yokohama, Japan, on Monday.
Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President, Media and Publicity, in a statement in Monday had appealed thatNigerians at home and in the Diaspora are urged to disregard concocted stories, backed with spurious visuals, of any protest or harassment of the President and his team. “It is the stock-in-trade of hate mongers, who do not realize that the rest of Nigerians have left them far behind.
“President Buhari will make his presence at the Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) count for Nigeria, and no scare-mongering or sabre-rattling will detract from the outing,” he said.
However, the Ohaneze Ndigbo Youths had warned IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, to desist from instigating IPON members to attack the president in Japan,
Kanu had stated that IPOB members have been put in alert to attack President Buhari on his arrival in Japan. This was after the attack of former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu in Germany.
