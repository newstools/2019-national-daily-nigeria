The new US policy on VISA issuance requires thorough screening of applicant’s phones, laptop or any other social media devices or technology communications gadgets.
National Daily gathered that a Palestinian youth, Ismail Ajjawi, 17 years old, offered admission into the Harvard University lost the opportunity when he was disqualified from issuance of US VISA because of posts by friends in his social media chat room.
US Immigration officials were said to have denied the boy entry after rejection of his friends social media posts found in his social media wall.
Reports indicated that Ismail traveling from Lebanon was interrogated for hours on arriving Boston Airport. He lamented that his VISA was cancelled after the US Immigration officials scrutinized his phone and laptop, making their findings. He decried that despite his explanations that he has nothing to do with the posts, the Immigration officials declared him “inadmissible” to the US.
Reports indicated that Customs and border Protection PRO, Michael McCarthy, explained that the disqualification of Ajjawi from entering the US was because of “information discovered during the CBP (Telephone, laptop and Social Media) inspection.”
Apparently, it has become apposite to be vigilant over what you or your friends post in the social media as well as contents of your phones and laptops.
