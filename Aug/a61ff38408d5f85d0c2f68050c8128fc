The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Friday told the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to make the welfare of people the cornerstone of his administration’s programmes.

He stated this at the retreat organised for members of State Executive Council and Permanent Secretaries.

According to a statement issued by Sanwo-Olu’s Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, Tinubu also urged the current Governor to work hard to achieve the programmes of the party in the state.

“Many books on leadership and administration have been written by great thinkers which focused on talent of individuals.

“But, is leadership about talent alone? I say no. Talent can only give you the opportunity to shine and get recognition among your peers. But it cannot pave the way for success.

“Talent without character is an effort to nowhere,” he said.

Also present at the cabinet retreat was the Minister for Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, another former Governor of the state.
