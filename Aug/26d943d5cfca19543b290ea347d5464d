Embattled former governor of Lagos, Akinwumi Ambode recently said he had never received any formal notification on a N9.9bn corruption allegation brought against him when accounts of the state traced to him were frozen  by a court order.
Now he has been formally informed. The EFCC allegedly raided his Epe residence Tuesday.
But the EFCC spokesman, Tony Orilade, denied they raided Ambode’s residence.
“It is not true, we don’t raid. Investigation is on-going in respect of the petition we have. that is why we are here,” he said.
No doubt more action will follow because EFCC’s investigation, especially under its Ag-Chairman Ibrahim Magu, is not cocktail party.
It includes , in most cases, detention and marathon interrogation that often lands the suspect in hospital.
Ambode’s then chief of staff was also implicated in the petition.
In a press statement by Habib Aruna, Ambode’s media aide, the governor said he had nothing to do with the accounts.
