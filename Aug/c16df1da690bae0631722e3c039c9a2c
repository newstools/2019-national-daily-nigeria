Freshly minted Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola is a sad man.
The burden of what he described as a strange ministry President Muhammadu Buhari gave him is already weighing down his spirits.
“My relationship with the ministry is distant. What I know about the ministry is what I read in the Newspapers,” he told ministry’s official and newsmen after inauguration Wednesday.
Many had thought the former governor would be appointed works minister based on his experience in a similar capacity when he was commissioner in Lagos under former Gov. Bola Tinubu.
Aregbesola, however, directed the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Georgina Ehuriah, to continue running the ministry until Monday when he will formally take over.
“I will come to take over on Monday. I give the Permanent Secretary the grace to run the ministry till then.
The burden may likely be shunted to the staff.
“The staff of this ministry should be ready for more work because I will be demanding much more from you,” he added.
“I promise you a realistic, reasonable and commendable leadership.”
Critics have complained of the way Buhari chose his cabinet members, saying the appointment was compensation for their loyalty.
