The Speaker of Kogi State House of Assembly, Right Hon Kolawole, on Friday celebrated the judgment of the Election Petition Tribunal which nullified the election of Senator Dino Melaye into the ninth National Assembly.
Kolawole in a statement commended the Tribunal on the decision to order a re-election for the Kogi West senatorial district, adding that the judgment confirmed the level of fraud perpetrated by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during the 2019 general elections.
The Speaker maintained that the decision of the Tribunal to order fresh election in upholding the request of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Smart Adeyemi, was victory for the entire well meaning people of Kogi West senatorial district.
He stated that the judgment of the Tribunal rekindled hope of the common man in the judiciary.
He enjoined APC members to be vigilant and prepare to win the rescheduled election.
However, Senator Melaye had decried that the judgment of the Tribunal is travesty of justice, a subversion of the peoples will. The senator is heading to the Court of Appeal to upturn the judgment.
