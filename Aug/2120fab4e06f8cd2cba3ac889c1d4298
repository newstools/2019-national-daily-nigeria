Former U.S. President Barack Obama has condemned language that feeds hatred and normalises racism.
Obama was commenting in a rare statement posted on his Twitter account against the background of the two mass shootings at the weekend, one of which was committed by a suspected white supremacist.
Obama’s comments came as many commentators and Democratic politicians accused his successor Donald Trump of using rhetoric that has encouraged white nationalists.
“We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments,” Obama said, without specifically mentioning Trump.

“Leaders who demonize those, who don’t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people.”
Such language had “no place in our politics and our public life.
“And it’s time for the overwhelming majority of Americans of goodwill, of every race and faith and political party, to say as much – clearly and unequivocally,” he said.
He also advocated the introduction of stricter gun control laws, something which he tried and failed to do in office.
