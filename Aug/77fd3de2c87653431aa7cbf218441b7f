Before the start of the season BT Sport created The Script with the help of data experts at Google Cloud, Opta and Squawka.
National Daily learned that The Script, simply explained, has attempted to predict every Premier League result in each game week from the start until the very end of the season.
Cutting edge ‘machine learning’ artificial intelligence, as BT Sport put it, is responsible for the predictions National Daily further gathered.
But of course football, a game filled with human error, red cards and injuries, has always been unpredictable, making The Script an interesting experiment.
Below are the predicted results for the third Premier League game week, including Liverpool’s tantalising clash with Arsenal.
 
Both the Reds and Gunners go into the match on the back of two straight wins in the Premier League so far this season.
Liverpool thumped Norwich 4-1 at Anfield on the opening day before beating Southampton 2-1 at St Mary’s.
Arsenal beat Newscastle 1-0 at St James’ Park in their opening day fixture before running out 2-1 winners over Burneley.
Liverpool are favourites to beat Arsenal this weekend, and this is reflected in The Script’s predictions for game week three.
Here are the Week 3 EPL predictions
Aston Villa 1-2 Everton
Liverpool 2-0 Arsenal
Norwich 0-2 Chelsea
Brighton 1-0 Southampton
Manchester United 5-0 Crystal Palace
Sheffield United 1-2 Leicester City
Watford 0-1 West Ham
Bournemouth 0-5 Manchester City
Tottenham 4-0 Newcastle
Wolves 1-2 Burnley
