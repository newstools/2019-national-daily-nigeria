He further argued that a total of 4, 235 votes were wrongfully credited to El-Rufai on form EC8A while 256 votes were also wrongfully entered for him, another 45,478 votes arising from unstamped result sheets that were unlawfully credited to El-Rufai, while 9,655 votes were equally credited to him, 6,840 unlawful votes arising from improper collation figures were also entered for el-Rufai while 1,098 vote were credited for him, 391,188 voids and unlawful votes were also credited to El-Rufai while 113,001 votes were equally credited to him.
Ashiru opined that he has given enough material evidence of substantial irregularities to enable the tribunal declare him winner of the March 9thGovernorship election in Kaduna State.
He insisted that INEC, Nasir El-Rufai and the APC in Kaduna State did not present the required evidence to counter balance the evidence by his witnesses.
