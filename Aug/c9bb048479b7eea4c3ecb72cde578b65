Naby Keita could become one of the best players in the Premier League, former Red Dean Saunders tells talkSPORT.

“Keita could be one of the best players in the league in the future.”

“He’s shown flashes of brilliance & I’m hoping he can kick on this season.”

Also, Harry Wilson is travelling to Bournemouth for a medical and to finalise a season-long loan.

The winger has enjoyed a decent pre-season with the European champions but looks set to play his football elsewhere this season.

And Sky sources are reporting that Wilson, who spent last season on loan at Derby County, will be going to Bournemouth and is very close to completing his temporary move.
