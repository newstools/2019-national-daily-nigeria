Former Senator Shehu Sani has responded to the story making the rounds that the APC national leader Bola Tinubu has appointed him as his campaign director in the northwest for the 2023 presidency.
According to the activist turned politician, the political gnomes spreading the news are afraid to face Tinubu.
“The Asiwaju remains my good friend,” he said in a Facebook post in response to the story.
“I’m not aware of his political plans and I don’t coordinate anything for him or anyone!!!”
He wrote that the story is “planted by some pusillanimous Political gnomes and Lucifers & disseminated by their associated purveyors and sprinklers of lies’.
“Those who want to fight the Jagaban should muster the courage to do so openly and not resort to peddling rudimentary mischief or use my name,” the post stated.
“Disregard the fake stories planted in some obscure online outfits that I’m appointed to coordinate the Presidential campaign of The Asiwaju in the North West.”
The senator has been frontal in criticising the north planning to hold on to power beyond 2023, especially as his sworn enemy and Kaduna Gov. Nasir l-Rufai has been campaigning against zoning.
