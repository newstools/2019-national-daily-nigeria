Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson thinks Jurgen Klopp could get the best out of Gareth Bale.

The Wales winger is surplus to requirements at Real Madrid and saw a lucrative move to China break down last month.

Lawrenson insists Bale, who earns £600,000-a-week in Spain, would thrive under Klopp.

He told the Daily Star: “I think Klopp could get the best out of him.

“The only problem is, would he fit into that front three? But you could even play him on the left of the three in midfield and let him bomb on.

“He’s such a good player and such a talent. He just needs to be loved and Klopp would be the perfect fit to do that.

“People say he’s got injury problems and all that but Klopp would get him mega fit.”
