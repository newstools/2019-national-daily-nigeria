The 33-year-old soldier, Sunday Awolola, who allegedly raped a student of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko (AAUA), has be remanded in prison, pending legal advice.

Recall that the soldier who was dismissed after an orderly room trial by the Nigerian Army allegedly raped a 300-level student of Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba Akoko, AAUA, in Ondo State when the victim was returning back from school.
Magistrate Mayomi Olanipekun of an Akure Chief Magistrate Court who gave the order on Friday, did not take the plea of Awolola, and ordered that he be remanded in Olokuta prison custody, pending the legal advice from the Ondo Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).

Olanipekun ordered the police to send the case file to the State Chief Registrar for safe keeping.

He, therefore, adjourned the case until Nov. 15, for legal advice.

Earlier, the police prosecutor, Insp. Adeoye Adesegun, told the court that the suspect raped the student on July 31, at about 6. 30pm in Ikare â€“ Akoko at a military checkpoint.

Adesegun alleged that the offence, contravened the provisions of Section 357 and punishable under Section 358 of the Criminal Code Cap37, Vol.1 Laws of the Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006.

However, the accused counsel, Mr Kayode Ikotun, prayed the court to grant his client bail due to health challenge.
