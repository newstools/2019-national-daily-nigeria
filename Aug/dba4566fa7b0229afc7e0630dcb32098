A renowned Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Mahmud Gumi, has cautioned that the north will be the most affected if Nigeria breaks up.
The Muslim Cleric was said to have highlighted that on the likely break up of Nigeria, the Southwest will be relatively stable; Southeast will be stable but the North will be volatile.
Sheikh Gumi was cited to have stated: “I see chaos and probably Nigeria can even disintegrate. And disintegration will be bad for Nigeria.
“Let me tell you about the North if there is disintegration. The worst thing any country will like is to have an unstable country as a neighbour.
“So, Southwest will be relatively stable; Southeast will be stable, but the North will be volatile. How can we contain Boko Haram in the Northeast? No way.
“How can we contain the problem of the herdsmen in the North? We cannot contain them.
“In fact, the little weight the Southwest and Southeast are adding to fight them is what is suppressing them, but if you go and leave us with them we will just eat ourselves and you have a very volatile North and I do not think we will have peace there because the borders are not barbed-wires and there are so many inter-marriages.
“In fact, Nigeria will just be like another Lebanon or Yemen. Nobody can control the North because nobody has monopoly of power in the North.
“The herdsmen, if they have any iota of political acumen, even if they are evil since your man is in power, what do you do? You lie low to allow him to have the power.
“You don’t become so virulent that you end up destroying the northern power by attacking people everywhere not caring who is there. Let me tell you this.
“Nobody is in control of the North now. No northern politician has that clout to embrace everybody in the North.
“Everybody in the North is with his clique and that is a very dangerous situation for the country. The Southwest is divided into two equal houses and nobody is in control there too.”
