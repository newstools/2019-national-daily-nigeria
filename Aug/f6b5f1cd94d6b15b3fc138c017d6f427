The police officers who molested a female undergraduate of the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA), have been arrested.
The Ondo state police command spokesperson, Femi Joseph, said this in a statement, and promised the issue would be thoroughly investigated.
The lady, identified as Sheba Ogbu, alongside some of her colleagues from FUTA were said to have had an encounter with some policemen attached to the ‘A’ Division Police Station, Akure, Ondo State capital.
The victim was allegedly injured by the policemen who were said to be four in number during altercation as regards the suspicious movement of the students.
In a video posted on Twitter, the victim, Ogbu was seen with one of her eyes bleeding.
Joseph who declined to reveal the identity of the policemen, however, explained that the matter involved two students, who were on a motorcycle and were drunk.
According to him, the students stopped for the policemen who were on patrol when they were flagged down and refused to be checked after catching-up with them during a pursuit.
“That was what caused an argument between them, leading to one of them to push the lady. But because the lady was drunk, she fell down and got injured.
