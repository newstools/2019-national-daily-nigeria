D.C. United have acquired midfielder Emmanuel Boateng from the LA Galaxy in exchange for $250,000 in Targeted Allocation Money. The 25-year-old has scored nine goals and 11 assists in 108 appearances with the Galaxy in nearly four seasons with the club. “Adding Emmanuel gives us another dynamic option from wide areas,” GM Dave Kasper said. “His ability to stretch the field and get behind the opponent’s defensive line will give us an additional attacking threat as we enter the final stages of the regular season.”
