Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Babatunde Fowler, whose four-year tenure expired on Saturday, has been queried over declining tax collections during his reign at the FIRS.

In a letter circulating on social media and dated August 8, 2019, Abba Kyari, chief of staff to the president, gave Fowler up till tomorrow to respond to the query — two days after his tenure would have expired.

He was appointed for a renewable term of four years on August 18, 2015.
In the query, Kyari wrote: “Your attached letter (FIRS/EC/CWP/0249/19/027 dated 26 July 2019) on the above subject matter, refers.

“We observed significant variances between the budgeted collections and actual collections for the period 2015 to 2018. Accordingly, you are kindly invited to submit a comprehensive variance analysis explaining the reasons for the variances between budgeted and actual collections for each main tax item for each of the years 2015 to 2018.

“Furthermore, we observed that the actual collections for the period 2015 to 2017 were significantly worse than what was collected between 2012 and 2014. Accordingly, you are kindly to explain the reasons for the poor collections.

“You are kindly invited to respond by 19 August 2019. Please accept the assurances of my highest regards.”
