KANO State Governorship Election Petition tribunal sitting at Miller Road on Thursday warned parties in the petition filed by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the election of Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of the All Progressive Congress (APC) that it will not entertain unnecessary adjournments.
Justice Halima Shamaki said proceedings in the matter are expected to end in October.
Counsel representing the petitioners, Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN), on Thursday told the court that they had to end presentation of their case.
Justice Shamaki said the tribunal would not accommodate delay tactics from the respondents.
The judge said INEC, Ganduje and APC are to put up their defence serially, explaining that the court, on the commencement of the opening of defence by the respondents, would not concede to requests for short adjournments.

“If one of the respondents finishes today, the next respondent should be ready the next day. We will not grant adjournments from any of the respondents, because you want the record of proceedings and that you want to go and study the record of proceedings; you all have your records.
“We are working with time. The respondents will take their days. For defence, we will allow all the parties the statutory time to file their written addresses. There will be no abridging of time. We should be rounding up by first week of October,” Justice Shamaki stated.
The PDP sued INEC, Ganduje and APC before the tribunal, faulting the March 23 governorship election victory by the defendants.
The petitioners tendered 1020 exhibits alongside the appearances of 34 witnesses of the 253 depositions made before the tribunal.
