A Former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, says Christians are being marginalized under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, accusing the administration of not doing enough to secure the release of Leah Sharibu.

He disclosed this on Tuesday while presenting a paper, titled “Good Governance in Nigeria today: A crucial role of the Church”, held at the Nigeria Bible Translation Trust (NBTT), Jos, Plateau State.

He said Christian leaders must be encouraged to speak out against bad governance, and tell the government to do the right thing for people like Leah Shariubu who has been abandoned by the government.

“I don’t believe for one minute that they have pushed hard enough for her to be freed, she was the only Christian among those girls that was not freed, and they came out boldly and said because she is a Christian she will not be freed and I expect the Government to do far more than what they are doing.

“This a blow on this government, it is a spiritual wound on this government because over a hundred million Christians in this country actually believe that if you are captured by these evil men, if you are kidnapped and carried away that they will not care about you because you are a Christian, meanwhile they care about the Muslims and ensure that the Muslims are freed, that is not acceptable and it is something that we should stand against,” he said.

He said Christians have been a target of Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen who have killed women, children and the aged in the past years.

“The church has to set an example by coming together as one to encourage Christians all over the country, we have over 100 million of Christians in this country, we need a strong church and a church that does not only show, but cares.

“I believe that the Christian community in this country have said all they can possibly say; Christians are not in charge of security agencies, Christians are not in charge of the judiciary, Christians are not in charge of the Executive, Christians are not in charge of the Legislature, Christians are not in charge of anything in this country any more.

“We must be sensitive as Christians to the challenges that Christians are facing in Nigeria, if we want peace in Nigeria, then nobody should torment, marginalize, enslave or attempt to destroy the Christian faith.

“The target on Christians is unacceptable, by any group of people or those that for any other reason don’t want to see them alive is unacceptable.

“We need to come together and urge our Government to do something in that direction to ensure that the safety and security of this country is guaranteed”, he stressed.
