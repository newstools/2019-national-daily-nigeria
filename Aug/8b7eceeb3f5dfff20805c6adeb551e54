Cristiano Ronaldo is publicly acknowledging he paid $375,000 in hush money to the woman who claims she was raped by the soccer star in 2009 — but still adamantly denies wrongdoing … and it’s all spelled out in new legal docs obtained by TMZ Sports.

Kathryn Mayorga had claimed she took the money from CR7 back in 2010 as part of a private settlement — and has previously said she signed a confidentiality agreement vowing to keep her mouth shut about the alleged incident.

As we previously reported, Mayorga claims she met Ronaldo at Rain Nightclub in the Palms hotel in June 2009 and went to party with him in his penthouse suite … where he raped her.

She went to police, but never identified Ronaldo by name — only describing him as a huge soccer star.

Back in 2018, she publicly ID’d Ronaldo and cops launched an investigation — but officials ultimately decided NOT to bring charges against CR7 due to lack of evidence.

Ronaldo has adamantly denied the allegations.

Mayorga filed a civil lawsuit against Ronaldo — and now, Ronaldo has filed new court docs asking a judge to throw out the case because they have a binding settlement agreement PLUS he claims the statute of limitations has LONG expired.

But, what’s interesting … in the same docs, Ronaldo finally acknowledges the amount paid to settle with Mayorga in 2010.

“Mr. Ronaldo paid Plaintiff the sum of $375,000 and both parties agreed to be bound by explicit confidentiality and non-disparagement obligations,” the new court docs filed by Ronaldo state.

Several lines of the new court docs explaining the details of the settlement have been redacted — but Ronaldo’s point is clear.

He also says in the court docs the settlement money is NOT an admission of guilt … but rather just the cost of keeping a legal dispute out of the media.

So, what happens now? Ronaldo’s argument will go in front of the judge who will ultimately decide whether Mayorga can move forward with her lawsuit.
