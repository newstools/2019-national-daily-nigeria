After four straight days in the DSS cage, RevolutionNow convener and AAC’s ex-presidential candidate Omowole Sowore was allowed to meet members of another of his group Take It Back Movement.
Sowore expressed gratitude to Nigerians and the international community for their support, urging them to pour out to the streets in protest against bad governance in the country.
“I would like to assure everyone that I am being treated well and in very good health,’ he said.
Rachel Onamusi-Kpiasi, director, media and communication of the movement, confirmed that Sowore was in high spirits.
But despite his perky spirits, Sowore refused to eat since he was arrested Saturday morning.
Many Nigerian activists, from experience during the late  President Sani Abacha era, believe things can get really lethal inside the secret service detention.
In a statement released on Monday evening, she wrote the Take-it-Back Movement were allowed to visit with Sowore, for the first time since his armed abduction in the early hours last Saturday, August 3.
“The officers allowed us to present him with food as Sowore had refused all meals since his capture.
“We are also happy to confirm that Take it Back members will be allowed to bring him food daily as per his wishes.
Sowore said he was pleased that the peaceful #RevolutionNow protests went ahead.
“However, knowledge of the sheer number of innocent Nigerians being arrested for exercising their civil rights bothers me.
“I join others in demanding for the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested by the police on Monday.”
Sowore was arrested by the DSS Saturday morning, two days to the planned nationwide protest which was eventually scotched by heavy military and police interruption.
 
Many Nigerians have criticized the arrest.
