A group of youth across northern Nigeria has condemned all the northern leaders, including Kaduna Gov Nasir El-Rufai for attacking directly or indirectly the APC national leader Bola Tinubu over the 2023 presidency—and for trying to deny the south of taking another shot at the topmost office.
“Whenever Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu seeks to contest for any position, including the presidency in 2023, we are ready to give him overwhelming support,” said the United Northern Youth and Students.
“We therefore dissociate ourselves from such irresponsible act of some minority youth from the North.”
The Coalition of Northern Group recently condemned Tinubu, saying he has betrayed President Muhammadu Buhari by plotting to succeed him, and mobilizing revolution against the president.
Speaking during a press conference Aug 16, Coordinator of the youth group, Comrade Jabir Maiturare, made it clear Tinubu has not declared to contest for any position yet.
“Instead, he is solidly behind President Muhammadu Buhari and giving him the required support,” he said.
Maiturare also stated that Governor Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai’s statement against the zoning arrangement in place is uncalled for.
“It should not be given any serious thought because he speaks only for himself and not for the north.”
The governor recently advocated the scrapping of the unwritten rule of zoning Nigeria’s presidency by the two major political parties.
