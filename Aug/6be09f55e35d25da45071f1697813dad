PDP’s ex-VP candidate Peter Obi is now the last prominent politician from the southeast that has yet to speak on the Nuremberg attack by IPOB on former Deputy Sen. President Ike Ekweremadu.
Even while the APC nad other very important politicians across party lines are pouring down support and sympathies on the senator, Obi is still composing his response.
His spokesman Val Obienyem said his boss has not spoken about the incident because of ‘his characteristic calmness but has appropriately made calls both within and outside the country”.
But Nigerians have not forgotten the V.P. candidacy zoned to the southeast brew some bad blood between Obi and Ekweremadu in run-up to the 2019 presidential election.
Both were considered as the running mate to Atiku Abubakar. Obi’s choice, however, shook the then deputy Senate president many speculated he would hop into the APC.
The southeast governors were also in support of an Ekweremadu V.P.
The odds were gradually piling up against Obi, and the cold war was getting heated before Ekweremadu decided to back down, and rallied his supporters for Obi.
The crack, many believe, worsened the division among southeastern leaders, and ultimately told on the Atiki-Obi performance in the predominantly PDP region.
The scar might not have healed.
