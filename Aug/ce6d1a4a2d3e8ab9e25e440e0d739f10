Former El-kanemi Warriors striker, Christian Attah Jr., has signed a three-year deal with Slovakian first division side, SKF Sered,National Daily learnt.

Christian, who left the shores of Nigeria last week to his new club side, scored four goals in training, which fast tracked his three-year contract.

National Daily gathered that the Abuja based striker who just signed the dotted lines did not fail to seize the opportunity, scoring his debut goal in his first competitive match against opponents Zvolen FC in the match that ended 0-2 in favour of SKF Sered in the Slovak Cup competition.

The lad appears to be gradually settling down in the Slovakian League with five goals already from training matches and the Slovak Cup Competition. Contrary to the thinking that the young striker would take some time to adapt, the young striker hit the ground running immediately with goals .

Attah will be in action against his fellow compatriot Super Eagles  fringe player, Rabiu Ibrahim’s club Skslovanbratislavs in week 4 of the Slovakian top league this weekend.
