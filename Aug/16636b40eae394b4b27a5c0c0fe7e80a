Represented at the event by the Head of Service, Deji Ajayi, the governor revealed that the state will hold its Festival of Arts and Culture in December, 2019, as part of the ways to boost the economy of the state.
“In the primary school teachers’ recruitment exercise we advertised recently, we wanted to employ 1,100 teachers and over 19,000 had applied on our website,’ he said.
“This shows that government must develop the skills and capacities of our youths to be able to be on their own.
“We are going to organise Ekiti State Festival of Arts and Culture in December this year to enhance our capacities in crafts, dancing, weaving and other vocational areas of arts.
” We should not forget to teach our children those values that will make Ekiti to remember their heritage and sustain our culture as a people.”
