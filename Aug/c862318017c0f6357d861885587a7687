Two local government areas, Madagali and Michika. in the northern Adamawa have been cut off from the rest of the state by rain which washed off a makeshift passage around a bridge earlier bombed by Boko Haram in 2014.
The Friday downpour through Saturday has covered up the broken Dilchim bridge.
Locals are now forced to stop at either end of the bridge.
Those bent on crossing were said to be using ladders to ramp them across.
Madagali LGA is 266 kilometres from Yola while Michika is 223 kilometres from the state capital.
The state governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has been appealing to the federal government to hasten the reconstruction of the bridge whose contract was awarded three years ago.
