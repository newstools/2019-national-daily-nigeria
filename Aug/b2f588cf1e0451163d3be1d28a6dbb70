Recent statistics released by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) shows that all is not well with mobile as the company lost 237,973 subscribers alone between June and July 2019.

Recall that when the parent company, Etisalat Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, exited the Nigerian over a loan crisis, 9mobile had about 12 million users, but the July report by the NCC shows 9Mobile now accounts for 8.8 million users.
The telecom had previously lost 3.49 million internet subscribers in the last two years.
 
Unlike its competitors, the network provider has struggled to hit the 16 million mark, as its highest climb has been 15.598 million users in September 2015.
 
According to NCC’s July report, 9Mobile accounted for 9 million subscribers in June, but lost 237,973 within that period, making 9Mobile the only network provider to drop in user number between June and July.
 
But while 9Mobile has been losing subscribers, the subscribers of Airtel Nigeria have been growing numerically. The latter added 428,012 subscribers within the same period 9Mobile lost over 200 thousand users.
 
This means Airtel recorded the highest additional number of users compared to MTN Nigeria, Globacom and 9Mobile. Airtel ended the month of June with 31.975 million users and closed the month of July 2019 at 32.403 million subscribers.
 
Glo had the second-highest growth in terms of subscriber number in the period under review. The company recorded an increase in its subscriber number after gaining 102,017 users at the end of July, hitting 29.124 million from 29.022 million in June 2019.
 
MTN Nigeria had the least growth in the same period, adding 14,353 users. MTN, which listed its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in May, ended July with 52.269 million subscribers from 52,254 subscribers recorded in June.
 
The company was launched in 2008, 7 years after Airtel Nigeria (Firm has changed names several times) and MTN Nigeria, and 5 years after Globacom launched.
