A mob at the scene of a bust by officers of the Lagos Police Command killed a police officer and injured two others Saturday after a stray bullet killed a woman.
The commandâ€™s Public Relations Officer Bala Elkana said the officers were part of the Anti-Kidnapping Squad that went to arrest a suspect at the Ijegun area of Lagos
The operatives were said to have opened fire on the suspect, and one of the bullets hit Biliki who was in her shop.
According to residents, the woman was rushed to hospital where she died.
One of the policemen was eventually caught and dragged to the palace of the traditional ruler in Ijegun, where a crowd of angry youths have requested to lynch him.
Elkana added that there was still tension in the area as a police team had been deployed in the area to restore sanity.
