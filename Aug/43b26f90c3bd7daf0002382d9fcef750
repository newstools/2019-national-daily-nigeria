Barcelona and Real Madrid were told by Paris Saint-German to submit their final offers for Neymar before midday on Friday, according to Spanish football pundit Guillem Balague.
He tweeted: “Barcelona AND Real Madrid have been asked to put a final offer before 12pm on Friday. Juventus also in the equation. “The latest twist: in the last few days the relationship between #Neymar, his father/representative and #PSG has improved dramatically (in a VERY positive way).” Neymar wants to return to La Liga, with Barcelona his preferred destination.
