Pogba’s future at Manchester United is still undecided with Real Madrid sniffing around the Red Devils’ prized asset.
The French international has endured some difficult moments lately at Old Trafford especially after the recent racist attack on him. Meanwhile, an end to Pogba troubles seems far away with infamous United fans at the center of his ordeal.
Report reaching National Daily has it that a group of Manchester United fans are asking for Paul Pogba’s exit from Old Trafford.
A sign outside Manchester United’s Carrington training base has been vandalised with the words: “Pogba out”.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was greeted by the vandalised sign as he arrived at the Red Devils’ training base on Wednesday morning.
The sign was newly erected last week and reads: “Players are no permitted to stop and sign autographs due to danger on the road. No congregating.”
The sign was criticised for helping to make modern football even less accessible to fans who congregate at Carrington to meet their heroes.
But Manchester United felt the sign needed to be erected due to the size of the crowds gathered by the entrance to the training ground over the summer holidays, which pose both a safety risk and obstruct local residents.
 
Meanwhile, the other entry point to Carrington on Isherwood Road is still accessible.
