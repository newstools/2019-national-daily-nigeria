PSV Eindhoven have agreed a deal to sign Kostas Mitroglou on loan from Marseille. The Greek striker spent the last campaign on loan at Galatasaray, and he was bought by Marseille from Benfica for 15 million euros in 2017. Mitroglou will act as Luuk de Jong’s replacement at PSV. Huesca have signed Getafe goalkeeper Ruben Yanez on a season-long loan.

Atletico Madrid have lowered their asking price for Angel Correa, with a 15 million euro difference separating their valuation from what AC Milan are willing to pay, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.

 Lille have enquired about signing Bayern Munich midfielder Renato Sanches, say L’Equipe. The Portuguese midfielder wants to play regularly and the prospect of Champions League football with Lille interests him.
