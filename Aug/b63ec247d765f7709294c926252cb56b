The director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum has attacked the APC national chairman n yet another letter, accusing Adams Oshiomhole of similar oneupmanship that ruined his predecessor John Odigie-Oyegun.
Salihu Lukman blamed Oshiomhole for all the crises rocking the party.
Two national deputy chairman from the north have been expelled so far, and over 3000 members f the APC crossed over to the PDP  Zamfara yesterday.
In a letter entitled “APC: Appeal for Reconciliation”, dated August 6, 2019, Lukman said in part, “My distant observation is that there is hardly any difference between your approach in managing the party and the way Chief Oyegun had managed it during his tenure.
“As a loyal party member, I have difficulty reconciling the absence of meetings of superior organs given all the challenges the party is going through, warranting the suspension of three serving governors (two of them now Senators) and two members of NWC.”
He observed that Oshiomhole and the entire party leadership have been living in denial of this reality.
By party leadership, Lukman meant the NWC, the national leader and ally  of Oshiomhole, Bola Tinubu, and even President Muhammadu Buhari.
“It would appear that the leadership problems facing the party are getting deeper and in the circumstances the business of building the party will be sacrificed.”
He cited the electoral loss of Oyo, Imo, Zamfara, Adamawa and Bauchi as enough wake-up call to the dangers that lie ahead.
“Is it that our leaders are indifferent to the possible return of People’s Democratic Party?
Many other party leaders have equally criticised Oshiomhole for his leadership style–sa style that enshrines party supremacy, at the expense of any partisan advantage.
It was that style that nearly ended the political career of two former governors who are now in the Senate.
