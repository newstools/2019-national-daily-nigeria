Chelsea defender David Luiz is set to join Arsenal in an £8m deal before the transfer window deadline, National Daily understands that
Luiz submitted a transfer request and will have a medical at Arsenal’s training ground on Thursday.
He is expected to sign a two-year contract before the 5pm deadline, after a deal was agreed between the clubs.
The 32-year-old centre-back trained away from the rest of Frank Lampard’s squad on Wednesday.
National Daily gathered from Sky Sports that Arsenal head coach Unai Emery wants to sign a centre-back before Thursday’s deadline.
“If we can on the last day, we will try to sign another centre-back, but one who has the capacity to help us,” said Emery.
“We have a lot of defensive players. Maybe, it is different when Laurent Koscielny tells us he wanted to leave.
“We tried to sign some important, expensive players for our defence. But when we can’t do that, the second line players don’t really convince us to sign them.”
“But the facts are, if Arsenal are going to sign players who are better than they already are, then I’m all in. There is no problem in that for me. And David Luiz, even though he takes risks, probably fits the Arsenal criteria much better than what Arsenal currently have.
“Defensively, if they sign him, I think it could be a cracking deal for Arsenal.”
