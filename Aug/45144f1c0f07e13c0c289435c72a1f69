Orders restoration of sanity

The Inspector-General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, has ordered the immediate posting of CP Ahmad Abdulrahman to the Enugu State Command as Commissioner of Police in charge of the State. He takes over from CP Suleiman Balarabe, who has been redeployed to the Force Intelligence Bureau, FCID, Abuja, as the CP in-charge of Intelligence.
The Force Public Relations Officer Force Headquarters, Abuja, DCP Frank Mba, in a statement on Tuesday narrated that CP Ahmad Abdulrahman holds double Masters Degrees â€“ one in Criminal Justice and another in Conflict, Peace and Strategic Studies, both from the Kaduna State University. A graduate of Political Science and Administration from the University of Sokoto, CP Ahmad also holds a Post Graduate Certificate in Corruption Studies from the University of Hong Kong.
The statement further highlighted that until his recent posting, CP Ahmad was the Commissioner of Police in charge of Intelligence at the FCID, Abuja. He has held many command positions across the Federation, viz. Kaduna, Bayelsa and Ekiti Commands. His posting as the CP Enugu State is predicated upon his action-oriented approach to work, his track record of outstanding leadership and interpersonal relations.
The IGP also charged the CP to bring to bear his wealth of experience, leveraging on the Force policy on Community Policing and Intelligence-driven crime fighting strategies towards overhauling the security architecture of the coal-rich State. The IGP further enjoined the people of the State to partner with the Police and accord the CP maximum cooperation in his efforts at revamping the security situation in the State.
The posting is with immediate effect, Mba said.
