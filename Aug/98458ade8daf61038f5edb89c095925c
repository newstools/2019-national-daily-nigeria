There is emerging innuendo that President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday tactically withdrew from the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Abuja.
National Daily learned that the said tactical withdrawal was not unconnected with the legal fireworks from Counsel to the petitioners, Livy Uzoukwu (SAN), which destabilized the witnesses invited by the president and the ruling APC.
National Daily also learned that at the Thursday sitting of the Tribunal, APC did not present a single witness or evidence. A source declared: “President @Mbuhari and his Party, the @OfficialAPCNg made a tactical withdrawal at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal. @Mbuhari used only two days of his six days while the APC did not present a single witness or evidence…”
National Daily,however, gathered that President Buhari and the APC have merely closed submissions while further argument on the substantive suit continues.
