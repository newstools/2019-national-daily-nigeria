Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike has warned all the LGAs authorities in the state to report any suspicious activities with respect to the planned #RevolutionNow protest on Monday.
“Rivers State is not part of the ‘Revolution Now’ protest and whatever illegal agenda it sought to pursue,” said Wike in press statement by his aide Simeon Nwakaudu..
The National Daily reported earlier that AAC former presidential candidate Omoyele Sowore was picked up Saturday by the DSS in connection with the said protest which the government tagged treason.
According to Wike, the security agencies in Rivers will arrest and arraign for prosecution anybody who gets involved in the protest.
The governor will be standing wit Buhari on this—though prominent Nigerians and activist groups have condemned the arrest of Sowore.
