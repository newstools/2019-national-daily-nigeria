The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, OYC, Worldwide has revealed its plans on how to tackle the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Bola Tinubu and his rumoured 2023 presidential ambition.

A statement on Tuesday by Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, its Secretary-General, said Igbo will be mobilized in the Southwest to thwart any plan by Tinubu to lead the country.

The group accused the APC national leader of unleashing terror on the peaceful Igbo during the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections.

It cited the Oba of Lagos’ “threat of drowning Igbo voters inside the lagoon and the secret mobilization of OPC boys to chase away potential Igbo voters in some quarters in the Southwest especially Lagos state”.

The statement said the APC leader must clear himself of the “allegations of fighting Igbos not to be part of President Muhammadu Buhari government, resisting the plea of Northern Elders Forum for Buhari to appoint an Igbo as Secretary to the Federal Government in 2015, provocative onslaught against the Igbos through demolition of markets in areas Igbos won some Federal and State Legislative seats in Lagos”.

It added that “Northerners are now wiser than 2015 where they blindly entered political alliance with South West that solely benefitted Tinubu political dynasty.

“They have clearly seen that Tinubu’s Presidency will divide Nigeria along ethnic and religious lines.

“As the political pact and alliance between the North and South West led by Tinubu seems crumbling, the road is cleared for the re-alignment of the North and Eastern Region becomes more feasible.”

Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council however urged Igbo to embrace the North to have a chance to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.
