The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa State has filled vacancies created by the suspension of three members.

The party had last week suspended Aliyu Bakari (Vice Chairman Adamawa Central), Saidu Naira (State Financial Secretary) and Babangida Talasai (party chairman of Mayo-Belwa) allegedly for trying to withdraw a petition which the APC filed against the state Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, questioning his election under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last governorship election.
A press statement issued by the state Publicity Secretary of the party, Hon Mohammed Abdullahi, named Abdullahi Wali, an ex-Officio, to coordinate the Adamawa Central Zone of the party as acting Zonal Vice Chairman.
According to the statement, Mr Medan Kaigama who had been the Assistant Financial Secretary is to serve as acting State Financial Secretary, while Mr David Majo, hitherto the party’s vice chairman in Mayo-Belwa Local Government Area, is to serve as the Acting council Chairman.
All the appointments are with effect from August 16, 2019.
They would be expected to remain in their respective positions for at least six months when the suspension slammed on two of the three affected members, Saidu Naira and Babangida Talasai, will last. Aliyu Bakari’s suspension is indefinite.
