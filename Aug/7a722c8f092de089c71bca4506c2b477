Gary Lineker poked fun of Jose Mourinho in a savage tweet, by claiming Manchester United’s win over Chelsea was their best performance with him at Old Trafford.

The Match of the Day host took to Twitter after United’s 4-0 drubbing of Chelsea to poke fun of the Special One – who has managed both teams at one point or another. Two goals from Marcus Rashford and further strikes from Anthony Martial and Daniel James saw United thump the Blues 4-0 at Old Trafford.

Mourinho even got a shout-out from the United faithful in Sunday’s clash, as – with the score 3-0 – the Stretford End erupted in chants of “Jose Mourinho…”

Despite United’s dominant win, Mourinho claimed Manchester City’s “B team” is more likely to win the league than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. When asked who he thinks will be title contenders this term, Mourinho said: “Four teams. Man City, Tottenham, Liverpool and Man City’s B team.

“When I looked at City’s bench and saw the players that weren’t involved in the XI, I believe even their B team can win the title.” Mourinho admitted it was “not easy” for him to come into the studio to give his take on a game between his two former clubs.
