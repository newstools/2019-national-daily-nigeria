Tottenham left-back Danny Rose is set to stay with the club this season, according to The Sun. The England international was subject to interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus this summer, but no formal approaches were made. Now the 29-year-old will remain with Spurs in 2019-20, barring any shocking late moves from another club.
Also, Arsenal initially rejected the Â£30m Everton bid for Iwobi. Everton were are in the market for another winger but with their attempts to land Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace faltering, they turned their attention to Iwobi.
Iwobi could have seen his playing time limited this season following the arrival of Nicolas Pepe from Lille and the return of Reiss Nelson from a loan spell with Hoffenheim. So when they finally agreed a deal it was win win for Iwobi and Everton.
