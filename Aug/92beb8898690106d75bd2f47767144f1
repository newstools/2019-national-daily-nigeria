Spurs have moved for Sporting goal machine Bruno Fernandes with talks deadlocked for Real Betis star Giovani Lo Celso. The north Londoners are determined to sign an goalscoring midfielder before next week’s transfer deadline. They have had a £52million bid for Lo Celso, however, rejected. The Argentina international – who scored 16 goals last season – had an £88million release clause but it is understood Betis would accept £70million for him. He is understood very much to be Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino’s prime target.

But with no sign of a breakthrough, the club have switched their attentions to £45million Fernandes, who scored 23 times from midfield for club and country last season. HITC Sport claim the free agent striker has agreed a deal. He left Doncaster in January and has previously played for Ipswich and Peterborough.
