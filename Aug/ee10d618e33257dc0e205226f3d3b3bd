National Daily gathered that Manchester United flop Alexis Sanchez was involved in Man United behind-closed-doors friendly against Sheffield United this week amid speculation of his departure from Old Trafford. Inter Milan has remained his likely destination.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted there was a ‘chance’ Sanchez could leave in the coming days after Inter submitted a loan offer for the 30-year-old forward. The Serie A giants are reportedly prepared to pay half of Sanchez’s £400,000-a-week wages and any deal would include an option to buy the Chilean permanently for a fee of around £14million at the end of the season. Sanchez played no part in United’s two opening matches of the Premier League campaign – against Chelsea and Wolves – but the attacker featured in friendly match at Carrington on Tuesday in a bid to improve his fitness.

According to Manchester Evening News, Solskjaer watched on as Sanchez, as well as youngsters Angel Gomes and James Garner, took on a Sheffield United side which included Ravel Morrison. Paul Pogba was also a spectator at United’s training ground and caught up with Morrison after the match, uploading a selfie with his former academy team-mate to his Instagram page. Inter have until the European transfer window closes on September 2 to reach an agreement for Sanchez

Asked about Sanchez’s future following United’s 1-1 draw with Wolves on Monday night, Solskjaer replied: ‘There’s still a couple of weeks left of the transfer window. ‘And there is a chance some clubs have shown interest in Alexis, so we’ll see what happens. ‘I can’t update you more than that.’
Roma were also heavily linked with Sanchez earlier this month, with Sanchez desperate for a temporary escape route out of United. The Chile international has scored just five goals for the Red Devils since his move from Arsenal back in January 2018.
