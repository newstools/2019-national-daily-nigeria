Radja Nainggolan is heading back to former club Cagliari. The Inter Milan midfielder was unwanted by Antonio Conte. Cagliari club president Tommasso Giulini confirmed the move on Thursday after he flew to Milan to negotiate for the player.
“We’ll update on Friday, but for Nainggolan to return would be the most beautiful thing in the world,” Giulini said on Thursday. “Was he with me at the Inter headquarters? Yes.”
Also, Dani Alves is heading home. Interesting one this from Goal Brazil. They state that Dani Alves – perhaps the man with more big-time medals in European football than anyone else – is heading back to Brazil.
Apparently he’s ready to sign a three-year deal with Sao Paulo. Not bad for a guy that’s 36.
