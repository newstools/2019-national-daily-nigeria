A Twitter user has been slammed for revealing he doesn’t accept Sallah meat from his Muslim friends.
@monye_morris questioned if it is biblical for Christians to eat Sallah meat slaughtered by Muslims during festivals. He said he turns down meat from Muslim friends.


He wrote,’Is it biblical for Christians to eat Sallah meat? Over the years, i have continuously turned down meat from my Muslim friends.’
Twitter users accused him of discrimination and hatred and they called him out for it.
What are your thoughts on this? Are there bible verses that support Christains eating Sallah meat?
