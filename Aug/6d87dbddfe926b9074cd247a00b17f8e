The 2019 Batch ‘B’ Stream II Orientation exercise will begin across the country on Tuesday, August 20.

In a statement on Monday, NYSC Director-General, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, felicitated with all the Prospective Corps Members of Stream 2, 2019 Batch ‘B’ on their successful mobilisation.
He advised them to make best use of the opportunity as they are on the threshold to begin a new phase of life.
The NYSC boss admonished that life is precious and must be treated with great circumspection.
He enjoined prospective Corps members to make adequate travel plans, “as every successful journey starts with a good plan” and also charging them to abhor night journeys; as such journeys make one susceptible to falling on harm’s way.
He strongly advised the Prospective corps members to avoid edibles from strangers as they could be laced with sleep-inducing substance that could make one a victim of kidnappers, robbers, ritualists and rapists.
“While in the vehicle, never get involved, either actively or passively on discussions that border on religion, politics and tribe. Just mind your business.
Ensure that you board a registered vehicle from approved park. Doing otherwise could spell danger. Please, ensure that the vehicle you want to board is roadworthy.
“When you arrive the Orientation camps, abide by all the rules and regulations guiding the camp which is a regimented environment.
