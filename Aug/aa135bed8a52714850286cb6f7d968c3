PSG exec confirms state of negotiations for Neymar amid Real Madrid links
Neymar’s days at PSG seem to be coming to an end, as the team’s Sports Director has shared a definitive update on the player’s future.

Speaking in an improvised press conference, the recently-appointed exec admitted that the player’s future seems to be far away from the Parc Des Princes, but that doesn’t mean that Les Parisiens are ready to ship him away.

“It is important for all of us to define his future. At this point, negotiations are in an advanced state, but that doesn’t mean we have struck a deal for him. This will help us decided if we will count on him or not for the remainder of the season,” Leonardo said.

PSG’s exec also confirmed that the club is handling this matter without consulting Neymar or his inner circle.

“This decision has been made by the club, not by the player,” Leonardo added.

Later today, coach Thomas Tuchel added that Neymar was not included in the squad that will face Nimes on Sunday. According to the German boss, the Brazilian player is still recovering from the injury that left him out of the 2019 Copa América.

Reports in Spain and France suggest that Real Madrid is the main option for Neymar to leave the Spanish capital, with a loan deal being worked out between both clubs. Another option for the Brazilian ace is to land on the Bernabeu via a swap deal, which would include players such as Gareth Bale, Keylor Navas or Isco, with a cash fee also included in the negotiation.

It is believed that PSG never wanted to sell Neymar back to Los Blaugranas, which may be confirmed by these fast dealings between Los Blancos and the French giants.
