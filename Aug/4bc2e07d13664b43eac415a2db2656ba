Arsenal moved from being hopeful of securing Kieran Tierney and David Luiz on deadline-day transfers to actually doing the business.  Gunners closed the Tierney deal in a £25 million ($30.4m) signing from Celtic  while a shock move for Chelsea defender David Luiz is was also done and dusted. Unai Emery’s side are hoping to land defensive reinforcements ahead of the new season, which kicks off this weekend.
Also, D.C. United land Kamara in $2.5 million deal. D.C. United have acquired striker Ola Kamara from Chinese side Shenzhen F.C. for $2.5 million. Kamara, 29, scored 48 goals and added eight assists in 90 MLS appearances over three seasons before his move to China in February. The Norway international will be expected to help fill the void left by Wayne Rooney, who will leave United at season’s end to join Derby County as a player-coach.
