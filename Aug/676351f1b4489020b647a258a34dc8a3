Report reaching National Daily has it that a group of Manchester United fans are asking for Paul Pogba’s exit from Old Trafford.
Pogba’s future at Manchester United is still undecided with Real Madrid sniffing around the Red Devils’ prized asset.
A sign outside Manchester United’s Carrington training base has been vandalised with the words: “Pogba out”.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was greeted by the vandalised sign as he arrived at the Red Devils’ training base on Wednesday morning.
The sign was newly erected last week and reads: “Players are no permitted to stop and sign autographs due to danger on the road. No congregating.”
The sign was criticised for helping to make modern football even less accessible to fans who congregate at Carrington to meet their heroes.
But Manchester United felt the sign needed to be erected due to the size of the crowds gathered by the entrance to the training ground over the summer holidays, which pose both a safety risk and obstruct local residents.
The other entry point to Carrington on Isherwood Road is still accessible.
The European transfer window closes on September 2 with Zinedine Zidane still holding out hope that he will get his man especially as Neymar looks set to re-sign for Barcelona if he does indeed leave Paris Saint-Germain this week, thus putting Madrid back in the driving seat for Pogba.
National Daily further learned from a Spanish publication Marca that Zidane is adamant he wants a deal done for the France internationl.
Pogba dropped a big hint over the summer that he is looking for a way out at Man United, telling the press he wants a new challenge.
