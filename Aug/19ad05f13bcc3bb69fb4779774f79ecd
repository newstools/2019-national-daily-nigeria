Many Nigerians living in Germany are already enroute to Abuja thanks to the German government that picked them up yesterday and sent them packing to Nigeria.
The deportation was coming less than 48 hours after Nigeria’s former deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu was attacked in Nuremberg by IPOB members on Saturday.
The migrants have already left Frankfurt Airport at 8 a.m., and were expected to land in Nigeria’s Murtala Mohammed International Airport between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.
According to an activist based in Frankfurt, those illegal migrants who have been given the information, thire plane will take off by 8 a.m. and arrive in Nigeria between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.
“When their asylum application is already expired, they are obligated to leave the country,” Rex Osa, coordinator, Network Refugees 4Refugees, told the Nation.
The organization is a political platform for refugees and migrant self-organisation based in Stuttgart.
“For those who don’t leave voluntarily, they will be given a what I can translate in English to mean toleration status. This status is not a resident title; it is to show that the person is still there because the deportation is hindered because of one reason or the other,” Osa addd.
He further explained how the migrants would be mopped up—from their quarters, offices, and others.
“When the police arrive in their rooms, they would be allowed to pack things not more than say 64 kilos. The police will be standing to make sure the person does not escape.”
The returnees, he warned, are coming with a lot of baggage—mental, physical, financial and others.
“Nigeria should be expecting a lot of people who have psychological problems, and people with spinal cord problems leading to paralysis.”
