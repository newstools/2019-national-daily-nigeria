A three-man panel led by Justice A. O. Chijioke, in a unanimous judgment, has accepted Smart Adeyemi’s grounds–irregularities, over-voting, non compliance—disqualifying PDP Sen. Dino Melaye’s victory in the Feb 23 senatorial election.
The tribunal has then ordered a fresh election in the senatorial district.
But Melaye has reacted.
In a tweet, the senator said he would get judgement at the Appeal court.
”On Tribunal judgement. No cause for alarm at all. Even if it went my way they will still go to the Appeal Court. Our mandate cannot be taken. We will get judgment at the Appeal Court.
”There will be fresh election in Kogi West because I will be Governor. For my Senate mandate no shaking.”
