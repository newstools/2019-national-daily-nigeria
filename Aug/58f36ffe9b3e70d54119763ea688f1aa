Jose Mourinho joins the Sky Sports punditry team for the 2019/20 season. And the Portuguese make his debut for the mouthwatering clash between Chelsea and Manchester United – his two former clubs.

Mourinho, 56, join Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp on Friday and Saturday Night Football as well as Super Sunday and Monday Night Football.

And Sky Sports say that the Portuguese will “bring a wealth of knowledge from dressing rooms and dugouts across the country and strong opinions” to the studio.
While Mourinho claims it is a “pleasure” to join the team and return to “his place on the touchline”.

He told Sky Sports: “The Premier League is a special competition for me, one that takes so much hard work to win and you just can’t take your eyes off the matches every week.

“Sky Sports is the home of the Premier League and it’s a pleasure for me to join this team and help to understand and explain what happened in each match.
“Football is a huge passion, it means so much to the fans, and I look forward to being part of the Premier League with them until I return to my place on the touchline.”
