The Nigeria Police at a check-point in Enugu State subjected a player with the Enyimba Football Club, Aba, Abia State, to harassment and intimidation over suspicion of being a yahoo fraudster sighting the expensive luxury car belonging to the player.
The Enyimba FC attacker, Stephen Chukwude, narrated to National Daily that two policemen in Enugu harassed and intimidated him on Monday when they sighted him driving an expensive new modern Mercedes Benz car.
Chukwude explained that having stopped for the Police, he presented his identity card, opened the boot of his car for searching, yet the police officers refused to let him go. The footballer said that the policemen disputed his identity telling him that any youth who owns or drives a Mercedes Benz car is a yahoo boy (internet fraudster).
The Enyimba FC attacker further narrated that when the policemen knew he was doing video recording of the ordeal with his phone set, they manhandled him to take the phone from him.
“The uniform men took me to a lonely place along the road. They tagged me a yahoo boy and told me to pull over. The policemen later took me to where I met other officers who then told me to settle them. One of them said to me – give us pure water money – So, I gave them N1.000, that’s how they allowed me to leave,” Chukwude narrated.
The Enyimba FC player also told National Daily that he thanks everyone for the efforts they made to ensure that he was not harmed by the policemen in Ugwu Oba in Enugu State.
