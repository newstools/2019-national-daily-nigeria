The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and Oby Ezekwesili, former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria, ACPN, have condemned the arrest of presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC, Omoyele Sowore, by men of the Department of State Services, DSS.

Omoyele Sowore, the convener of #RevolutionNow Protests, was picked up at his apartment in the early hours of Saturday.

The politician posted a distress tweet at exactly 1:25 am which reads, “DSS invades Sowore’s.”

Later he added another tweet which could be a confirmation that his phone must have been seized while trying to raise the alarm about his arrest.

Reacting, SERAP in a statement on its official Twitter page said, called for Sowore’s ‘immediate and unconditional release.’

The terse statement reads, “SERAP strongly condemns the arbitrary arrest of opposition leader and activist @YeleSowore by SSS.

“The Nigerian authorities should immediately and unconditionally release him. Sowore’s unconditional release will be a first step to stop Nigeria’s precipitous human rights slide.”

Also reacting, Oby Ezekwesili, former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria, ACPN, in a tweet called for Sowore’s release.

According to her “@AsoRock ought to know that they cannot sustain this unconstitutional habit of repression against #CitizensRights.

“All these persistent acts of @NGRPresident to shrink the Public Space with rabid level of intolerance for dissension will surely fail.”
