Embattled lawmaker, Senator Dino Melaye, has boasted that he will defeat Smart Adeyemi his opponent in the last senatorial election in kogi state anytime, describing him as his ‘political wife.’

He stated this in an interview on Friday, after the Kogi State National Assembly and State Assembly Elections Petitions Tribunal sacked him as the Senator representing Kogi West district.

A three-man panel of the Tribunal led by Justice Anthony Chijioke, has ordered a fresh election in the senatorial district.

Melaye, who contested the election on the platform of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), said he was not worried by the judgement, boasting he had always defeated Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC).

“I want to assure you that Smart Adeyemi is my political wife.

“I defeated him in 2015, I defeated him in 2019 and any day any time, he is my political wife.

“I want to say that I cannot be distracted and I will not be distracted. My name is Daniel; I will not fall … I am focused on my governorship ambition and we will get it.

“The only time there will be election for the seat of the Senate in Kogi West is after I am sworn in as the governor of Kogi State.

“That will necessitate vacancy but before then, there will be no by-election as a result of attempted robbery that is going on right now.

“Spiritually, we are already in the court of appeal; physically we will be there on Monday. The only election that will be conducted is the governorship election that I will win. My mandate is secured, my mandate is guaranteed,” Melaye said.
