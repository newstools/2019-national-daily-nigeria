That’s according to former Barcelona and Chelsea winger Pedro, who hit back at false claims he declared Sergio Ramos and Virgil van Dijk as the best in the world. He wrote on Instagram: ‘I want to explain to all my supporters that on yesterday’s press conference I did not said that Ramos and Van Dijk are the two best centre back in the world, as several media has said.
“If you are asking about who is the best, if I have to select only one I would say Piqué because I think he is the best active nowadays. The best centre-back I’ve ever played with is Puyol and the one I’ve liked the most.”
‘He would be a bomb inside the locker room’. Barcelona legend Hristo Stoichkov has warned against bringing Neymar back to the Nou Camp. Stoichkov believes the Brazilian would be “a bomb inside the locker room” if the Catalan giants were to beat their rivals Real Madrid to his signature. “Barcelona does not need Neymar,” the 53-year-old told Univision. “He has no place because there are already important players. There is Dembele, Griezmann, Suarez and Messi.
“Where is he going to play? He would be a bomb inside the locker room. For my part, I don’t want him to come back.”
