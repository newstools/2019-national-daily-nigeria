Reports reaching National Daily have it that Wilfred Zaha has posted a video of himself training
in a Manchester United shirt which got fans excited that a shock return transfer could be on the
cards.
The Crystal Palace star showed off the technique that has made him such a wanted man this
summer as he practiced free-kicks in the garden.
In a clip posted on Instagram, the 26-year-old hits four deal balls over a wall of plastic dummies,
with three of his efforts finding the top corner.
He is wearing United’s away kit last season, which features the number three on the back
alongside Eric Bailly’s name.
Zaha, who clearly still has an affinity for his former side, left fans overexcited that the clip could
be a sign that he wants to return to Old Trafford next season.
Even rapper and United fan Stormzy replied, writing: “My bro you look peng in that shirt btw”,
alongside a series of love heart eye emojis.
