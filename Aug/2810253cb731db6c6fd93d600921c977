DCA‎ (Sodium Dichloroacetate) is a colorless, odorless, inexpensive, relatively non-toxic, small molecule, and now, a new cancer cure discovered. And researchers at the University of Alberta believe it may soon be used as an effective treatment for many forms of cancer.

However, DCA is not a drug and therefore cannot be patented so no drug company is going to spend millions of dollars to bring it to market.  However, the medical research is clear: DCAturns on the mitochondria of cancerous cells, which directs the cell to commit apoptosis (suicide) and die off, something which normal cancerous cells do not do.

‎It also restores the cell’s original function of apoptosis enabling shrinkage in tumor size and mass. Testimonials have revealed reversal in illness, remission, clean health tests and increased vitality. What’s more, scientifically measurable results have been accomplished within days of starting treatment.

Amazingly, it only affects cancerous cells and leaves the healthy cells intact, unlike toxic chemotherapy, radiation and prescription drugs.
