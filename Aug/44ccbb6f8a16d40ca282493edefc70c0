Kano Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje is taking legal action against Rivers Gov. Nyesom Wike for the alleged demolition of the Rainbow Town Central Mosque in Trans-Amadi Area, Port Harcourt.
Ganduje’s media aide , Abba Anwar, in a statement, said the governor described the incident as a sad story and promised to take all necessary lawful action against the Rivers State Government.
Former Governor of Kano Ibrahim Shekerau Friday attacked Wike for the same allegation, asking Muslims and Nigerians to condemn the governor.
But Wike said only the fickle minded make such claim–that he demolished a mosque.
Kano government said it has started touching appropriate quarters against the demolition.
“Kano State is known for peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians, we should, therefore, improve on that and remain calm and peaceful. People should live peacefully with one another,” Ganduje said.
Gov. Wike, too, has addressed newsmen over the matter, right on the said demolition site.
“It is most unfortunate that fickle-minded persons will claim that a mosque was demolished at this place, when no mosque existed here. The story was concocted by mischief makers to score cheap points,” he said.
“The truth is that people came here to erect illegal structures. There was no approval from the state government for any structure to be erected here. The persons who started the foundation had already dragged the state government to court on the disputed land.
“The Rivers State Government won the case. What they attempted to do was to start the illegal construction to tie the hands of the state government.”
The mosque demolition story got viral following a video showing Wike claiming Rivers is a Christian state. But that was two months ago.
