National Daily gathered from reports made available by La Gazzetta dello Sport journalist,
Nicolo Schira that Manchester United have agreed a contract with Sporting Lisbon midfielder
Bruno Fernandes.
The club spoke with the player’s agent overnight, and agreed a six-year deal worth around
£106,000-a-week, according to Schira.
However, Schira warned that if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ed Woodward want to complete the
deal, they will have to part with £65million (€70).
The overnight developments came after reports that United had walked away from a possible
deal for Fernandes, despite being linked to the player all summer.
“Tonight #BrunoFernandes’s agent has talked with #ManchesterUnited to close the agreement
for the player (ready a contract by €6M a year until 2025),” tweeted Schira.
“Now #RedDevils must finalize the deal with #Sporting for €70m.”
