After series of denial by Okoi Obono-Obla, it is now confirmed that President Muhammadu Buhari has suspended the Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property.
Okono-Obla’s suspension is to take effect immediately until completion of the ongoing investigations by ICPC.
This was disclosed in a series of tweets on the verified page of the Nigeria President.
The post read: “President Buhari has directed the suspension from office, with immediate effect, of the Chairman of the Special Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Mr Okoi Obono-Obla.
“The suspension shall be in effect until the conclusion of ongoing @ICPC_PE investigations into a number of cases relating to Mr. Obono-Obla.”
The Nigerian Police earlier sealed the office of Obono-Obla.
The sealing of his office comes on the heels of his rumoured sack as the chairman of the panel on recovery of public property.
The Police Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, explained that the action was carried out based on a complaint said to have emanated from the Federal Government.
