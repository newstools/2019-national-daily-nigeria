A Kaduna High Court has granted Shiites leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky leave to travel abroad for medical treatment.
He and his wife Zeenat are now permitted to travel to India for treatment.
In his ruling on Monday, Justice Darius Khobo ordered officials of the state government to accompany El-Zakzaky during his trip abroad.
Justice Khobo, however, did not give details of when the two will travel, and how long the leave will last.
Reacting, counsel to the Kaduna State government, Dari Bayero said the prosecution team would go back and study the judgment to see if they should appeal the ruling.
El-Zakzaky’s counsel Femi Falana said the ruling was just to grant the IMN leader and his wife leave to seek medical attention abroad and not an outright bail.
