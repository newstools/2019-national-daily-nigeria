The chairman of Unity FC of Asaba,  Miebaka Lugard Precious, has stated that his team is not in the 2019 Bet9ja Royal Cup to make up the numbers, but to reach the group stage and go on to claim the coveted crown,National Daily learnt.


Miebaka said he is delighted that his team have registered for the competition and preparations have started in earnest.


The chairman of the modest club commended Bet9ja agents for being at the forefront of reviving grassroot football in Delta State presently, since most corporate bodies and individuals are not willing to invest in sports generally.


“Our target is to win the trophy,” Miebaka stated. “We’re not here to make up the numbers. I’m happy we’ve registered for the competition.”


“Well, I believe in my team that we will go higher in the competition…but the grouping will as well tell,” he admitted.


“I commend Bet9ja agents for being the champions of grassroot soccer revival in Delta State. Nobody wants to help here by investing in the game at the grassroot.”


Miebaka urged Deltans to support and follow the 2019 Royal Cup tourney, when action formally gets underway on September 14, 2019, saying that this would help the organizers to meet their desired goal.


“Let’s try and give our best in supporting the royal cup competition to meet to her target,” he added.


He believed that the tournament would be an avenue for raising grassroot football enthusiasm within and around the state capital, Asaba.


Unity FC will trade tackles with other teams in the qualifying matches in Oshmili South Local Government Area for a place in the group stage.


The draws for the 2019 Bet9ja Royal Cup will hold at Wellington Hotels in Effurun, Delta State.
