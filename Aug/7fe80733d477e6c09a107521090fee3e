Kogi Deputy Gov Simon Achuba may be impeached soon as the state House of Assembly begins impeachment process.
No fewer than 21 of the 25 state lawmakers have signed an impeachment petition sent to the House.
The petition was read Wednesday by the majority leader of the House, Abdullahi Bello (Ajaokuta, APC) as a petition on the floor of the Assembly.
According to him, the petition was based on three grounds of criminal indulgence, financial misappropriation and non-performance.
The speaker, Kolawole Matthew, directed that the petition be served on the deputy governor for him to respond to within the 14 days’ time frame of the law.
A panel will be set up to investigate Achuba’s side of the story.
Achuba and Gov. Yahaya Bello his boss have been fighting cold war that nearly sparked off violence recently, when the deputy governor cried out that his boss was after him.
The petitioner was not mentioned on the floor, though. The move, many believe, would most likely come from the governor’s hatchet men.
