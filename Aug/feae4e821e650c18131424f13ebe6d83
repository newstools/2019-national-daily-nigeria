The Boko Haram fighters in the north east Nigeria have gone ahead the military in applying technology in their warfare, using drones to monitor operations of the troops in the battle field. National Dailylearned that this was the revelation of Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State when the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Right Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, visited Maiduguri, Borno State, for on-the-spot assessment of the security situation in the north east.
Governor Zulum was cited to have expressed the perturbation: “The capacity of the military has to be re-examined in terms of technological warfare. Otherwise this thing (insurgency) will never end.
“Boko Haram now uses drones to monitor the operations of the military. Without providing proper and up-to-date technological capacity to the military, this thing will never end.”
National Daily also learned that the Borno Governor demanded the Federal Government to increase the “numeral strength of the security and paramilitary personnel fighting the insurgency war as well as support the civilian JTF to meet the emerging challenges.
“Sustained military operations in the Chad Basin cannot be overemphasized in the face of the scaled-up operations of ISWAP in the region.”
The governor noted that Borno shares borders with Niger, Chad and Cameroon.
Speaker Gbajabiamila had decried that the insurgency had continued for “a bit too long and we have to put it behind us.”
He was of the view: “it is not yet Uhuru; we are not there yet and the government can’t do it alone.”
