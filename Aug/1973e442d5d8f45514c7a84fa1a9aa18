Bashir said his side have taken adequate note from their failings against the Asaba side and well poised to make amend by picking at least a vital point at the Lagos side, FC Robo Queens.

National Daily learnt that the key point in the league is ability to take your chance(s), we did not take our chances in the first game against Delta Queens and the match ended even for both sides.

“Delta Queens left Osogbo with a vital point so we can, too take a point off FC Robo Queens in Lagos.

“A point is okay in an away match moving forward though our target is to pocket the whole three points at stake,” said Bashir.

Bashir insists that his side are sorely missing the services of their prolific striker, Mary Anjor who has jumped ship to team up with the champions, Bayelsa Queens.

“Anjor is a match winner, a key player who always comes to our rescue whenever we are in a tight corner. We are missing her greatly.

“However, we have young talented strikers in our midst who are ready to cause enormous damage to the opponents.

“They must have picked valuable lessons in the draw against Delta Queens and will surely come to the party against FC Robo Queens,” said Bashir.

Osun Queens are second on the four-team abridged NWPL Group A log on one point two behind leaders, Rivers Angels.
