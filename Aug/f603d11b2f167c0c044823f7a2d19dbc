The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has threatened to publish details of what it described as commercial activities between IPOB and southeastern senators Ike Ekweremadu and Eyinaya Abaribe—on overthrowing President Muhammadu Buhari.
The Igbo youth group said it is angry by the fact that IPOB under Nnamdi Kanu is now violent which is against the foundation of Biafra agitation.
The group, the National Daily gathered, said it would expose the reason behind former Senators Ekweremadu and Abaribe guaranteed  the Kanu’s bail.
According to a press statement by the group on Saturday, the alleged conspiracy to upturn Buhari’s government was hatched before, and sustained after, the Feb 23 presidential election.
The statement also pointed at  “one former minister from Obosi, who is the unofficial link to reach Nnamdi Kanu in foreign countries”.
“We will expose IPOB with the truth, as there’s a dossier which chronologically with dates the underground alliance between them and opposition parties, so to avert the further humiliation of Igbos, which IPOB ignorantly leads Igbos to her worst nightmarish misfortunes both economically and politically,’ the group said.
“Except IPOB retract their steps and allow peace to thrive in Igbo land, except they change their tactics with mixture of half-truths with fantastic falsehood.”
The Igbo youth group has been openly supporting Buhari and his government, in defiance of the general stand of the southeastern leading Ohaneze Ndigbo which plays more or less an opposition game.
