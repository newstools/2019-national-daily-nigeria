In what was a tightly contested affair, Nigeria lost slimly to host, Macedonia 37-34 in the IHF World Youth Championship yesterday, National Daily learnt.

The coach Emeka Nnamani tutored side had gone into the match with lots of determination and renewed vigour to get their first win after losing to Bahrain in their first game as line player Ebinatei Kiripoimini Ekpodio was a nightmare for the Macedoniansâ€™ defence, as he led his side with six goals in the first period and finished with a total of 11.

The home team, who are also debutant in this competition, led after the first half and had to survive a difficult second period to get their first win of the championship as Martin Serafimov and Nenad Kosteski combined for 11 goals in the first half and totalled 10 and 13, respectively.

Nigeria will now have to get a must win victory when they play Denmark who earlier defeated Argentina 29-19 on Friday.
