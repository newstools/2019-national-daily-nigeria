A MEMBER House of Representatives representing Kachia /Kagarko federal constituency of Kaduna State, Gabriel Saleh Zock, has declared that the priority of all the lawmakers from the state is the socio-economic development of the state.
Zock said the representatives are committed to effective representation and will do anything in the interest of the state, including assisting the state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, secure $350 million World Bank loan he had requested earlier.
The governor had during the 8th National Assembly applied for the World Bank loan, but senators from the state’s three senatorial zones kicked against it, expressing fear that generations yet unborn would not be able to repay such loan, if granted and taken.
Addressing reporters in Kaduna at the weekend, Zock said: “Our priority is to ensure that we represent Kaduna State effectively. We will ensure that whatever will bring development to Kaduna State is given priority above any other thing.”
He added: “We are at the National Assembly believe that since it is Kaduna people that took us to the assembly, whatever the governor of the state, Malam Nasir El-Rufai , and the people of the state want from us, we will do it for them.”
