Liverpool began their quest to equal Manchester United’s 19 English Premiership League titles after they narrowly lost out that chance last season to Manchester City.
 
Jurgen Klopp’s side showed their ambition for another full-throttle season when they successfully annihilated the newly-promoted Norwich City 4 – 1 with goals from their Egyptian talisman Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Divock Origi and Roberto Firmino in the 2019/2020 season’s opener at Anfield on Friday night.
 
Rather unfortunately, their five-star performance came with a prize as there was no such thing as a perfect day. Liverpool saw the shine taken off their rousing victory by the sight of Alisson Becker, their goalkeeper, being taken off injured in the first-half.

The Brazilian suffered a problem with his right calf when taking a routine goal-kick, seven minutes before half-time. As the game briefly continued, Alisson signalled immediately to the bench and, after a lengthy delay, was helped from the field by Andy Massey, the club doctor.
 
The positive thing for the fans however was that Alisson at least turned down the option of a stretcher, but the concern on the faces of Klopp and his coaching staff, as well as Alisson’s team-mates, told its own story. Liverpool can ill-afford a long term injury to one of their key players, and the 26-year-old was in obvious pain and discomfort.
