The Provost of Adeyemi College of Education in Ondo, Dr. Samuel Akintunde, has said the Federal Government had allocated N100 billion to boost research activities in tertiary institutions across the country.
Dr. Akintunde spoke at a seminar, tagged: Proposal Writing, at the college.
According to him, the money was earmarked by the Federal Government under the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETfund) and dedicated as National Research Fund (NRF) with the aims of boosting academic development and enhancing people’s skills in project proposal writing and research activities.
He said: “The Federal Government is interested in boosting research activities in tertiary institutions and has joined the rest of the world to acknowledge the fact that you cannot improve your society without research.
“So, a lot of money is now being pumped into research work. Over N100 billion has been earmarked by the Federal Government under TETfund as National Research Fund.”
The provost urged teaching and non-teaching staff of the college to constantly work for self-improvement through acquisition of more knowledge.
He added that the college workers could use the opportunity provided by the funds for research from the Federal Government to improve their skills in research proposal writing.
Akintunde hailed the Directorate of Gender and Sustainable Development Studies in the college for organising the seminar.
The provost also thanked the presenter, Prof. Bridget Teboh, from the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, the United States of America (U.S.A), for identifying with the college’s growth and development.
Describing Prof. Teboh as erudite and international scholar, the college administrator expressed optimism that participants would benefit from her wealth of experience and become more knowledgeable in good proposal writing skills at the end of the seminar.
