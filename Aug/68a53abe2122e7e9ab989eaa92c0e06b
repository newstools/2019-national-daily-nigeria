Liverpool academy striker Liam Millar has completed a season-long loan move to Kilmarnock.

He returns to the Scottish Premiership team after making 14 appearances for Kilmarnock during a temporary spell in the second half of last term.

Millar, who plays his international football with Canada, has been with the Reds for three years and signed a new long-term contract in January.

And also, in other news, while reports in France claim Arsenal are going to sign Philippe Coutinho, talkSPORT can exclusively reveal the move is NOT so close to completion.

Barcelona have agreed to loan out the Brazil midfielder this summer and he WILL return to the Premier League, with four clubs looking at him.

talkSPORT understands Liverpool, Man United, Arsenal and Tottenham are all keen on signing Coutinho before Thursdayâ€™s 5pm transfer deadline.
