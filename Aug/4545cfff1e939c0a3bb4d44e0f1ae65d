Two policemen were killed as a horde of bandits attacked Zamfara’s Gov. Muhammed Matawalle convoy Thursday.
Others attacked on the entourage also sustained injuries.
The entourage of Nasarawa’s deputy governor was also attacked recently, and four people, including policemen were killed in the shootout with armed bandits
The Matawalle ambush took place close to Funtua, Katsina, a border town with Zamfara.
The state government has yet to make any public statement relating to the incident.
What the citizens know for now is that the bandits were political thugs of a party in the state.
There has been friction between the state’s ruling PDP and the last APC government who administration the current governor is probing.
Thousands of the APC members have been flocking to the ruling party since inauguration.
Matawalla was declared governor by court—for the election he lost to the APC whose primary was annulled by the court.
