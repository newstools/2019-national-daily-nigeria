Virgil van Dijk believes the title race will be much closer than last season.

Liverpool and Manchester City have been tipped to fight it out for top spot after a thrilling 2018/19 battle.

But with Arsenal and Tottenham strengthening their squads over the summer, Liverpool star Van Dijk is refusing to write off the club’s rivals.

“The thing is, there are more teams who have improved around us,” he said.

“So it’s going to be tough for both of us [Manchester City and Liverpool], everyone is talking about how it will be a two-horse race but we can’t think too far ahead.
