Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, has been reportedly arrested by the Department of State Services, DSS.
After a loss in the Feb 23 election, Sowore has channeled his energy into convening a protest movement—RevolutionNow Protests. He reportedly met with the leader of proscribed IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu.
Many believe his arrest might not be unconnected to these.
Sowore posted a distress tweet at exactly 1:25 am which reads, “DSS invades Sowore’s.”
He also tweeted about the arrest.
