The African Action Alliance (AAC) on Friday expelled Omoyele Soworeâ€“its national chairman and ex-presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections.
No fewer than 28 other national officers of the party were sacked along with him.
The party took the decision at its ongoing national convention at the Rockview Hotel in Owerri, the Imo State capital.
This is the second term the Sahara Reporters would be expelled.
Leonard Nzenwa has been elected as the new national chairman of the party.
Sowore was arrested last Saturday, and a federal high court just ruled the DSS could keep him for 45 days, and come to apply for more, i the course of its investigation into treason allegation against Sowore.
