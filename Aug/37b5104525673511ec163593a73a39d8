Manchester United have completed the £80million signing of Harry Maguire.
The Red Devils had been in hot pursuit of the centre-back all summer and previously had a £70million bid for him rejected.
National Daily gathered that United returned with an improved offer on Friday morning that was accepted. The switch is set to take place following a medical.
The transfer fee eclipses the £75million Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk in 2018, making Maguire the most expensive centre-back of all time.
England international Maguire was left out of Leicester’s squad to take on Atalanta at the King Power Stadium on Friday night so that the transfer could be completed.
Maguire will become Manchester United’s third signing of the summer following the acquisitions of Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bisska from Swansea and Crystal Palace respectively.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appeared to be running out of time to complete the deal for Maguire, and recently bemoaned the length of the transfer window.
I think we have picked the short straw,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports News.
“When we are done and our league starts there are still three more weeks with clubs hovering around your players, I don’t think it’s a good one for us, no.”
Manchester United executive vice chairman Ed Woodward was pictured arriving at the club’s London offices on Friday to thrash out the deal for Maguire.
United are still working on transfers for other players including one for Paulo Dybala.
The Dybala deal to Manchester United is complicated as Romelu Lukaku’s future will play a part in the proceedings.
In an ideal scenario the Belgian will sign for Juventus with Dybala heading in the opposition direction, but the two clubs are someway off agreeing on a deal just yet.
