It’s the biggest transfer news in the world as we speak. And the actors are quite aware of the status quo. As the pressmen feast on every strand of information they can grab. Every gesture from Barcelona and PSG is viewed with a magnifying glass as the transfer story of Neymar Jr inks on.

It’s this reported that Barcelona and Paris St-Germain have agreed terms on the value of Neymar. And that is according to BBC Sport and its interpretations of things.

Having sold the Brazilian to PSG for €222 million in 2017, Barcelona are willing to offer the Ligue 1 champions €200m plus Jean-Clair Todibo, Ivan Rakitic and Ousmane Dembele on a season-long loan in order bring Neymar back to Spain.

BBC reporter Guillem Balague however stresses the deal is not done with none of the three players being offered to PSG yet agreeing to a move.

The Catalans remain determined to bring Neymar back to Barcelona and refuse to give up hope of striking a deal before the transfer window closes.
