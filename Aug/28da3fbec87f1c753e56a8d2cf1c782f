One of the FBI-wanted suspects that fled the US has been busted in Nigeria by the EFCC.
Oyediran Joseph, Yoruba, was caught in Ilorin,  north-central,  by the commission zonal office.
The arrest just shattered the assumption that cybercrime is rampant only in the southeast, especially as 77 of the 80 suspects declared wanted in the US are from the southeast.
According to the commission’s  Zonal Head, Mr Isyaku Sharu, who spoke at the second edition of a press briefing tagged, ‘EFCC/FBI collaboration in the fight against internet fraud and cybercrime in Ilorin, the arrest followed a letter of assistance from the United States authorities.
The commission, two weeks ago, was asked to track, and possibly arrest and prosecute two most wanted FBI suspects in Nigeria.
He explained that the anti-graft agency acceded to FBI request to assist, which lead to the arrest of the 30-year-old Oyediran.
The suspect has allegedly made about N60m from the loot through Western Union transfer.
The zone in the southwest is actually crawling with cyber criminals.
The zonal head said within seven months of their operations in the zone, the agency had independently arrested over 50 suspected internet fraudsters, secured conviction of 25 of them and forfeited exotic cars and monies running into millions of naira to the Federal government.
According to him, the commission  had traced properties linked to some cybercrime suspects to choice areas in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti state, ranging from supermarkets, plaza, and many more with conservative value of the properties put at about N1bn.
