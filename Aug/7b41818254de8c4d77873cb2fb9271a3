Onyechere Ibeakanma,a bank worker,  46, took his own life last week by taking insecticide Sniper in Lagos.
Back at Umunemeze Afuguri in Umuahia, Abia, Ibekama was said to be good man–and intelligent too. He had N16m in his account too.
So it beat everybody why the man would commit suicide.
It is a sacrilege, his native community said, planning a rtual when his corpse woud be brought home for burial.
He was, however, buried in Lagos last week.
According to a close family source, the human resource manager left a suicide note for his wife, who went shopping when he came back from work.
The note reads:
“The best, that’s what I used to call you. Finally, this is the end of my journey here on earth. The evil I have been battling with has succeeded in quenching the flame. You married a wrong man. You’re a good woman and you deserve the best. You need to be happy. You need to soar.
“Please take care of our princess, Chinenyenwa. Tell her that I love her so much. Be peaceable with everyone though it’s not gonna be easy. Tell my family not to harbour any resentment against you. You’re a blessing to us. That’s the wish of a dying man. Don’t cry for me but pray for me. I love you and Chinenye so much. Goodbye my beloved.”
