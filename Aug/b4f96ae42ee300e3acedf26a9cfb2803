KANO State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has, as part of his prerogative of mercy programme, facilitated the release of 200 inmates from 10 prisons.
Those released under his administration are now 2,717, from the time his committee on Prerogative of Mercy started working on his directive.
After Eid-Prayer with the Emir of Kano, His Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II, the governor went round a few places as his usual tradition during Sallah period.
Among the places was Kano Central Prison.
At the prison after being received warmly by the officials and the inmates, he said he was at the prison for the release of some of them, advising them to be of good character after their jail terms.
“Some of you are released because of old ages, some because of illness and some of you are released after paying the fines put on you by different courts. After we paid on their behalf, they can now go and rejoice with their families during this Sallah festive period.”
“After our Prerogative of Mercy Committee went thoroughly through court records of some of you, we found out it could be good and encouraging if we could pay and pardon some of you. This is what we have been doing since our coming as a government,” he said.
Comptroller of Prison, Kano Magaji Ahmad Abdullahi hailed the governor for his immense contribution in beautifying and helping the prisons in the state.
All the released inmates were given N5,000 for them to use as transport fares to their homes.
At the VVF Hostel,  Kwali, Ganduje promised to put in place a modest skills acquisition centre at the hostel to help the victims to be trained and become self-reliant after being recovered and discharged.
The hostel, according to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Welfare, Auwalu Umar Sanda, treated 825 female victims of VVF from January this year to date.
He hailed the state government for the treatment of the victims, whom, he said, were doing very well.
