The order came after the Chairman of the Recovery of Government Properties, Mr Jasper Ndubuaku, was allegedly assaulted at Okorocha’s residence.
The SSG to the governor, Uche Onyeaguocha, said that the state had also placed Okorocha on security watch and urged Imo citizens to arrest him and alert the government whenever they found him in the state.
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a video, trending online on Thursday, captured some thugs beating Ndubuaku at Okorocha’s residence on Spibatt Avenue, Owerri.
The state Commissioner of Police  Rabiu Ladodo and the SSG confirmed the incident to newsmen at a joint news briefing in Owerri.
They announced that a citizen’s arrest had been declared on Okorocha over the incident.
According to them,  Okorocha hired thugs to attack Ndubuaku, who is also the special adviser to the governor on security matters.
They said that the Senator representing Imo West would be arrested and prosecuted anytime he entered the state.
Ndubuaku alleged that he was beaten at Okorocha’s residence and thrown into a gutter by some thugs.
He added he was first held hostage for some hours by the thugs in the presence of security men attached to Okorocha’s residence.
“We got a court order to recover stolen properties kept in Okorocha’s house and when we got to his house on Thursday, armed thugs attacked us.
“There are 20 government vehicles in his house, four Speed Boats, one movable crane and generator sets, which we went to recover before the incident.
“We will not give up the battle, we will go back to his house because the property belongs to Imo government,” Ndubuaku said.
But Sam Onwuemeodo, the Special Assistant on Media to Okorocha, said the recovery committee was attacked by the former governor’s sympathisers and passersby.
He said that the recovery team went to Okorocha’s house without a court order, adding that they invaded Okorocha’s residence with no fewer than 50 thugs.
