The 5-time Balon d’Or winner has confessed that he endured a difficult time last year having had his honour questioned due to the rape allegation leveled against him
Cristiano Ronaldo endured a season that saw him net 21 league goals and assisted 8, but led Juventus to an 8th successive Serie crown and Coppa Italia triumph in his first season with the Italian giants. He also won the UEFA Nations League with Portugal and was named as the tournament’s best player and highest goalscorer in the Finals. But the player has come out to prove his critics right, that his performance last season wasn’t up to par.
Ronaldo was accused of raping a woman in Las Vegas more than 10 years ago but won’t face criminal charges after it was determined the investigation failed to show the claim could be proven at trial beyond a reasonable doubt.
Speaking to Portuguese television TVI, Ronaldo said: “2018 was probably my worst year ever, personally speaking. When people question your honour, it hurts, it hurts a lot.”
The 34-year-old Juventus forward had this to say when asked about the 2009 accusation brought on by Kathryn Mayorga, an American who in a separate lawsuit says she was pressured to sign an agreement to keep quiet in exchange for $375,000. He said he was not “comfortable speaking” about the case, “but when people attack your honour, it is difficult.”
He also said he was thankful and proud that “once again” his innocence was proven.
Normally, People who say they are victims of sexual assault are not usually named by the media. Mayorga gave consent through her lawyers to be named.‎
