The German Coach handling the Super Eagles of Nigeria, Gernot Rohr, has acknowledged that he feels loved by Nigerians, noting that this is a major reason he is attached to the country and the national team, the Super Eagles.
The German, who holds a French passport, however, noted that such love appeared to have reduced since the end of the 2019 African Nations Cup in Egypt.
Coach Rohr who led the Super Eagles to the third place, wining bronze medal at last month’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt noted that “one category” of people didn’t show him love especially after the AFCON.
“We have differences between Francophone countries and Anglophone countries but I didn’t have any problem adapting (in Nigeria) because I was welcomed by everybody, not only in the team but the staff, and also from Nigerians.
“When I go out, I feel this love, I feel it everywhere. The only people I don’t feel this love from, there is only one category, especially after the AFCON, and you know who it is. But everywhere, if it is here or in other places, I feel this love, this is a reason for me, which makes it very hard to leave because there is human relationship which is important also.
“This is the most passionate (job) because the passion around me is giving me also the passion, enthusiasm and desire to do well. This job here is very different because we speak English, which I did not speak for a long time, since my school time. But I have learnt back quickly; the mentality is also different,” Rohr was cited to have said.
