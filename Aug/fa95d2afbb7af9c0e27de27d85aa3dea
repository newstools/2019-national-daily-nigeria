The former Brazilian captain has been pining for a return to the Camp Nou, two years after he
ditched Barcelona for Paris Saint Germaine in a world record transfer fee of £198million.
Neymar has reportedly grown dissatisfied with life at Parc des Princes and has been determined
to leave this summer after yet another disappointing UEFA Champions League campaign.
However, optimism about a potential return to Barcelona has disappeared in recent weeks, with
PSG reluctant to do business with Barcelona.
The la liga giant’s vice president, Jordi Cardoner ruled out Neymar’s return while speaking at the
unveiling of Barcelona’s newest signing, Junior Firpo. According to Cardoner: “As of today,
there’s no Neymar case, as the president said, and it’s complicated.
“We are passive actors. We know he’s not happy in Paris and it’s a situation that needs to be
resolved in Paris.
“We haven’t spoken to them. There is a lot of respect between the clubs and if there is a Neymar
case one day, we’ll talk. Today, at this time, it’s ruled out.”
PSG will only consider selling Neymar back to the Camp Nou if Barcelona produce an offer of
£200m for the want-away Brazilian.
Such a sizeable bid is impossible for Barcelona this summer especially after the club spent
£105m in a deal to land Antoine Greizman from Atletico Madrid.
