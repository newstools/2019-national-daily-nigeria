Barcelona’s quest of re-signing Paris Saint German superstar Neymar may have suffered a major setback with this transfer window set to close this weekend. The Brazilian has been linked with a return to Camp Nou just two years after leaving the Catalans in 2017 in a world record fee valued around £200 million.
Why Ousmane Dembele, as at today, is the most important man in Barca. Meanwhile, PSG will only allow the most expensive player leave if Ousmane Dembele is included in the deal to land the 27-year-old.
However, the Frenchman’s agent Moussa Sissoko was said to have rejected the plan, saying his client is not prepared to leave Barca just yet. Reports reveals that: “He is staying 100 per cent. There is no chance he will leave,’ Sissoko told Telefoot. ‘He wants and will win at Barca.”
Dembele joined the La Liga champions in the summer of 2017 from German League side Borussia but has not been able to live up to his billing due to series of injuries that have plagued his career at the club.
The 22-year-old is currently our of action for the club after picking an injury in their opening league clash against Athletic Bilbao.
He will stay on the sidelines for at least four weeks owing to the hamstring injury he suffered in their first game of the season. The Frenchman has scored 18 goals and 17 assists in 66 appearances for the Catalans since he joined them two seasons back.
The Catalan club president Josep Bartomeu alongside the sporting director Eric Abidal led the delegation as they prepare final offer for the Brazilian star. Earlier this summer, Barca asked the Ligue 1 champions to release the player for them on loan with an option to sign him permanently in a deal around £155 million next summer.
