The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had issued guidelines for PoS in Nigeria to provide minimum standards and requirements for the operation of the payment system.
Part of the guidelines states that all industry stakeholders who process and/or store cardholder information shall ensure that their terminals, applications and processing systems comply with the minimum requirements of the following Standards and Best Practices (for PCI, the minimum requirement will be level 2.1).
“In addition, all terminals, applications and processing systems should also comply with the standards specified by the various card schemes. Each vendor must provide valid certificates showing compliance with these standards and must regularly review status of all its terminals to ensure they are still compliant.
“There will be a continuous review and recertification on compliance with these and other global industry standards from time to time.
“Only CBN licensed financial and non- financial institutions shall serve as merchant acquirers. Merchant acquirers can own PoS terminals, but shall only deploy and support PoS transactions.
