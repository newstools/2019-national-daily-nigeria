The planned #RevolutionNow protest has been aborted in Lagos.
Armed policemen, backed by soldiers, blocked the entrance to the  National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos, the venue of the rally, as early as 7 Monday morning.

Protesters that defied police presence and gathered opposite the stadium were teargassed. One person was shot.
Some other protesters were  arrested, and shipped away in a Black Maria.
The arrowhead of the protest, Omoyele Sowore, was arrested Saturday morning, and has been kept in the DSS detention since then.
Many Nigerians have condemned the arrest.
