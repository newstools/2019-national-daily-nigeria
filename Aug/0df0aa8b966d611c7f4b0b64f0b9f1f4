Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, has reacted to the re-arrest of Uyi Giwa-Osagie, Atiku Abubakar’s lawyer and his son-in-law, Abdullahi.

Speaking via his Twitter handle on Friday, Fani-Kayode said that, even if the president jailed every single Nigerian, and no one is left on the street, the stones will rise up to oppose him.

His tweet, “President Buhari needs to appreciate the fact that using EFCC to arresting Atiku’s lawyer (Giwa-Osagie) and son-in-law (Abdullahi) changes nothing and doesn’t deter anyone.

“Even if you jail EVERY Nigerian and no one is left in the streets, the stones will rise up and oppose you.”

Recall that the EFCC had earlier filed a money laundering charge against Giwa-Osagie, after he was re-arrested in February at the height of the election campaigns.

The arrest and subsequent detention of Giwa-Osagie, was described as a political witch hunt, aggressive intimidation, and harassment of opposition actors in some quarters.

However, the anti-graft agency is accusing the Senior Advocate of Nigeria of laundering $2million ahead of this year’s general elections.

According to EFCC, Giwa-Osagie took possession of the said $2 million without going through a financial institution.

It stated that the sum exceeded the amount authorised by law to be transacted in cash.

The agency’s three-count charge was signed by prosecuting Counsel Rotimi Oyedepo, and was filed at the Federal High Court in Lagos against the lawyer and his brother Erhunse Giwa-Osagie.

The anti-corruption body further explained that the two brothers allegedly contravened sections 18(a) and 1(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011, punishable under Section 16(2)(b).
