Manchester United’s all-time leading goal scorer is reportedly hatching plans to return to the Old
Trafford as a coach after his professional playing career.
The 33-year-old, who scored 253 times in 559 games for the Red Devils between 2004 and 2017,
is currently with MLS outfit DC United.
Rooney’s contract with DC does not expire until the latter stages of 2020, but the former England
captain is allegedly already making plans for after his retirement.
“Wayne is already looking to the future and wants to remain in the game. He also wants to keep
his family together and to do what is best for Coleen and their boys,” The Sun quotes a source
close to Rooney as saying.
“So a job at United would be perfect. Wayne would like to one day move into coaching. Long-
term, he would love to be a part of what Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] is creating.”
Rooney won 16 trophies during his time with United, including five Premier League titles, one
FA Cup and one Champions League.
