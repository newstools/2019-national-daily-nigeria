Male cross-dresser, Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, otherwise known as Bobrisky, is now at risk.
The federal government has declared war on him because “he is a national disgrace”.
Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, made the disclosure in an interview with the Vanguard.
The renewed effort to smoke out the LGBT community in Nigeria followed the fear that parents are losing their heart on discovering their children’s changing sexual orientation.
“If we don’t address Bobrisky as early as possible, he will form a team that will spread like wildfire.This will result in a lot of suicide cases, because the typical Nigerian parent would not want to see their child become a Bobrisky.”
He noted a case of a popular Nigerian who recently paid an unexpected visit to his son in England only to discover that the son is a gay leader.
“The man was brought back to the country on a wheelchair,” he said.
According to Runsewe, there are other Bobriskies that are Nigerians, but they live outside the country.
The DG recalled that Bobrisky started by selling and using bleaching creams, and, how, now, he has grown boobs, bums and hips.
‘If a Bobrisky is doing well with his immoral lifestyle, how do you convince Nigerian youths to do the right thing? Bobrisky has the right, but not within the Nigerian environment,” he said.
He added it’s not an entertainment issue–but a war to save Nigeria for a better tomorrow—-a war for which he knows he is bound to be attacked.
”My job is to preserve and protect the culture of this country. It would be unfair for me to be silent on this. You now find male prostitutes by the roadsides.
”I’m talking with the strength of information and authority. I have information that over twenty-three Nigerian boys are already starting Bobrisky’s brand.
”Immediately we started the war, they pulled out because we are going to get them arrested. They cannot destroy this country.”
