President Muhammadu Buhari may have ordered all the ministerial nominees confirmed by the Senate last week to submit their credentials, which include claims of educational qualifications, valid identity cards, among others, for scrutiny before inauguration. The president also approved induction training to make the ministers designate be familiar with the policies of the federal government.
The President in a statement by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, notified all ministers designate to submit relevant documents for study preparatory to inauguration of the Federal Executive Council (FEC).
The SGF in the statement declared in part: “Following confirmation by the Senate, all Ministers designate are by this NOTICE informed that relevant documents for their study and guidance, preparatory to the inauguration of the Cabinet shall be available for collection at the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (OSGF), Cabinet Affairs Office, from 10.00am on Tuesday August 6, 2019.
“Ministers Designate are also requested to please bring along and submit to the OSGF, their updated CV in soft and hard copies as well as any valid identification document.
“Finally, I am pleased to inform you that, in view of the need to allow Ministers Designate enough time to study the documents (Status Report on Policies, Programmes and Projects; the 2019-2023 Road Map, FEC Handbook, etc) and considering the upcoming Sallah break, His Excellency, Mr. President has approved an INDUCTION RETREAT for Ministers Designate to be held at the State House Banquet Hall, Abuja from August 15-16, 2019.
