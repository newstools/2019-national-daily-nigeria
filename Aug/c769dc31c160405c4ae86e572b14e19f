The Cameroonian government has deported 133 Nigerian refugees back to the country. They are expected to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society by the federal government.
Officials of the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, were said to have, however, explained that the returnee refugees volunteered to come back home.
The Director of Refugees and Migrant Affairs, Lawal Hamidu, was said to have explained that presently, 97,000 Nigerians, mostly from Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states are still taking refuge in Cameroon.
It was said that the returnee refugees will spend six days in a camp at Bamba, where they will be screened and identified. They will also be trained in any skill acquisition of their choice before being reintegrated into society.
