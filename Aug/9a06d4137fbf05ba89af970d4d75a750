PSG would appreciate a deal of 30m Euros loan deal for Barca to have Neymar this season + a full return of the buyer-out clause 200 Euros, next season for them to have him fully.

Eric Abidal may return to Paris in the coming days to deal with PSG, with an offer similar to that the French side used to take Kylian Mbappe from Monaco without upsetting FFP regulations. A loan with obligatory option to buy.

Barcelona would pay a fee for Ney’s loan and the rest in a year as a transfer. PSG want Dembele and Semedo in exchange, Barcelona are willing to offer Rakitic. Neymar is keeping is silence so far, talking only to sporting director Leonardo. He wants to leave PSG and return to Barcelona.

But at the moment, everything is still the same regrading Neymar’s future, with all to play for.

Madrid are financially able to make a big offer for the forward but also need to rid themselves of the salary of Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez.

In sporting terms there is a problem too, with Bale ‘reborn’ against Celta. And would signing Neymar block the progress of Vinicius Jr and Brahim Diaz?

There is also the fact that Neymar snubbed Madrid in 2013 and is a controversial character, which adds another later of doubt in.

Barcelona, meanwhile, would love him back but it is all a question of money.

One of the reasons that Barca are confident of getting Neymar are the calls each day from Paris to Barcelona. PSG know they have a problem and want to resolve it as soon as possible. They know keeping Neymar is a time-bomb.
