The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged Nigerians to use this year’s Eid el Kabir to imbibe the life of total trust in the Almighty God in all spheres of life.
PDP in a statement at the weekend noted that “the Eid el Kabir, indeed, offers us great lessons on selflessness and absolute trust in God, as exemplified in the life of Prophet Ibrahim.”
The party, therefore, appealed to all compatriots to use the occasion to particularly pray for the nation, reach out and share with the less privileged, the deprived as well as victims of escalated insecurity in various parts of our country in the recent time.
The PDP also solicited prayers and support for our gallant troops who are making sacrifices and putting their lives daily on the line in protecting the nation. “Nigerians should always remember the sacrifices of our fallen heroes by reaching out to their families at this trying time,” the PDP said.
The party also charged leaders in all walks of life, including public office holders, faith-based and community leaders, captains of industry and employers of labour to note that their positions are bestowed on them by God for service to humanity, and for which they must give account.
The PDP, then, prayed for the unity, peace, stability and development of Nigeria while it wished Nigerians, particularly the Muslim community, a happy Eid el Kabir celebration.
