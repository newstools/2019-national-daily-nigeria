It’s been an interesting past season for Liverpool. And to crown it all, their defender, VVD just emerged as Europeans Best Player. Bearing Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi to it.
Perhaps that explains the high spirit of the club especially as it relates to their transfer policies.

Roma’s attempt to land Dejan Lovren on loan has been shutdown by Liverpool, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.

The Serie A side made an offer to take the defender on loan with an obligation to buy but the Reds have rejected that proposal.

Roma returned for Lovren after they were unable to agree a deal with Juventus for Daniele Rugani.

Although the curtain has dropped regarding transfers in England. It doesn’t stop other leagues, like Spain, France and Italy to still move players from the EPL.
