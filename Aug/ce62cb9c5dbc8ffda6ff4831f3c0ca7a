Former Liverpool midfielder Ray Houghton has admitted he is surprised Jurgen Klopp has not added at least one star name to his squad this summer.

After signing Virgil van Dijk, Alisson and Fabinho in 2018, the German has taken a more measured approach this year.

Youngsters Harvey Elliott and Sepp van der Berg have both moved to Merseyside over the summer, but are hardly the blockbuster signings Liverpool fans were hoping for.

Houghton told talkSPORT: “He [Klopp] always went out there and brought in the right player at the right time, just this time around I’m slightly surprised Liverpool haven’t gone out there and brought in one or two more additions just to improve the squad.

Also, Liverpool wanted to sign Junior Firpo earlier this summer, but the 22-year-old has instead joined Barcelona.

The LaLiga champions have spent an initial £16.5million on Firpo, though Real Betis could make £23m off the deal if various add-on clauses are met.

Jurgen Klopp had identified Firpo as a possible signing as he wants to bring in full-back cover having lost Alberto Moreno on a free transfer.
