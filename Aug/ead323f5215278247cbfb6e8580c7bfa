DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, addressed reporters in Abuja Sunday afternoon, saying Sowore was taken into custody because he called for a revolution in Nigeria.
The spokesperson was referring to report by the Nation.
He also added that the secret police was “aware” of information that Sowore had been in touch with foreign actors to destabilise Nigeria
There are no details of the activist’s whereabouts.
Rights activists and CSOs have criticized the federal government for the arrest which violated Sowore’s fundamental rights.
