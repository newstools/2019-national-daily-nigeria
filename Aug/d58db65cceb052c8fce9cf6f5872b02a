Despite the arrest of the Convener, Omodele Sowore, by the DSS and later the Police, Idris Abdul Kareem led thousands of Nigerian youths to defy the heavy presence of soldiers, DSS and Police to join #RevolutionNow mass protest in Lagos on Monday. The youths were not scared by the presence of the stern looking soldiers and Police in participating in the protest.
However, the explosion of teargas canisters by the Police dispersed few youths but some others were adamant in pursuing their course of the day.
One of the participating youths declared; “#RevolutionNow ongoing in Lagos and Abuja, Nigerians big Cities.
“Come out everyone and let’s send them a message that it’s time; Revolution has just begun.”
