Harry Maguire’s future remains uncertain – with Manchester United and Leicester still £20million apart in their valuation of the England defender.

United’s are willing to pay £70m for Maguire, but Leicester are determined to hold out for £90m, with the transfer window closing in under a week.

It is understood United are considering would consider increasing their bid to £75m, matching the world record free for a defender Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk.

But United are adamant they will not be bullied into paying significantly over the odds for Maguire, with the Reds feeling Leicester have put an unrealistic valuation on the 26-year-old.
