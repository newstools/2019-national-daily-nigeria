Chelsea are still looking for the first win of the Frank Lampard era, and will be hoping that match number four, this Saturday against Norwich City at Carrow Road is the ticket.
 
After three games in the span of eight days, Chelsea have had the entire week to prepare for this trip, and have welcomed back Antonio Rüdiger and Willian to training as well.
 
While Lampard will probably shed better light on this in tomorrow’s pre-match press conference, both players could be available for selection, having made bench appearances last week. Rüdiger also completed 90 minutes for the reserves on Monday, while Willian even received a few minutes at the end of the 1-1 draw against Leicester City last weekend.
 
Callum Hudson-Odoi also returned to training this week, but is not expected to return to competitive action until after the international break.
 
Davide Zappacosta’s departure does leave the squad without an obvious backup right back until Reece James’ return from injury (also September, probably). Andreas Christensen, Fikayo Tomori, or even Kurt Zouma could all play there, while young Tariq Lamptey had joined first-team training on Wednesday as well.
 
Meanwhile, newly promoted Canaries have played some fearless football so far, collecting three points last weekend with a Teemu Pukki hat trick-inspired win over Newcastle, after losing to Liverpool 4-1 in the opening match of the new season.
