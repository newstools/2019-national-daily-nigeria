One of the 77 persons on the list of FBI’s suspected Nigerian fraudsters wanted in the US has been found on Imo Gov Emeka Ihedioha inauguration committee–and one other.
Chika Odionyenma was appointed into the inauguration committee with  a letter the governor signed, congratulating him on the expected acceptance.
A copy of the letter on the appointment of Odionyenma into the committee which planned the governor’s inauguration was reportedly seen by TheCable
“Following my successful declaration as Governor-elect of Imo State by the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC and my subsequent receipt of certificate of return thereof, I have duly constituted an inauguration planning and handover committee, with the responsibility of liaising with the existing government to ensure a smooth handover of power to our party on 29th May, 2019,” the letter read.
“I will be pleased if you can serve as a Member of the Sub-Committee on Logistics. The committees will be inaugurated on Tuesday 9th April 2019, Rockview Hotel Owerri at 12 noon.
“I trust you will avail us your expertise and time in carrying out this assignment to support the quest to rebuild Imo. “While recognizing your sacrifice, accept my congratulations.”
Not stopping there, the governor still jobbed the suspect into the “Committee for Recovery of Looted Property in Imo” —a body chasing former government officials suspected to have been illegally taken by former officeholders.
There has been no official response from the governor or his media handlers since the newspaper broke the news.
Odionyenm comes from Amakaohia-Uratta, Owerri North local government.
