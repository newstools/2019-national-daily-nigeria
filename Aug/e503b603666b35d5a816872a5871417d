A former Niger Delta militant leader has described Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, as an “ingrate and Frankenstein Monster”.
Asari Dokubo said this while knocking Kanu for the attack on former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, by some IPOB members in Germany on the weekend.
In a video he posted on his Facebook page, Asari said he I saw this coming, describing Kanu as a fellow Frankenstein Monster being created.
“I saw the signal, saw the red flag and I warned that if something is not done about Nnamdi Kanu, he would consume the Igbo people,” said the former warlord.
“Ike Ekweremadu, who I know very well was one of those who made this ingrate called Nnamdi Kanu to come out of prison. I’m privy to most of the discussion and I feel very sad that I was part of those meetings.
“Ekweremadu and Abaribe were the arrow heads that moved for the release of this ingrate called Nnamdi Kanu.
“That Ekweremadu will be attacked, disgraced and his clothes torn for what purpose and to achieve what is unexplainable.”
According to him, if this dangerous trend is not stopped among Igbo Biafrans, where one man arrogates to himself the right to give life and pronounce death, then he will be in fire because others will fight him.
“Shame on all those supporting it,” he added.
“What contribution did Nnamdi Kanu’s father or mother gave to the Biafra liberation struggle””
He insisted this is the time to send him out.
