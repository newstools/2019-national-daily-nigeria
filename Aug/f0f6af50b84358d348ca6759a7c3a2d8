A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted a request by the ICPC to freeze bank accounts allegedly owned by the immediate past Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulâ€™aziz Abubakar Yari.
Justice Taiwo Taiwo, in a ruling on Friday, in an ex-parte motion by the ICPC, ordered that the accounts in Polaris and Zenith banks with funds in US dollars and Nigerian naira, be frozen.
Justice Taiwo ordered ICPC to publish the order within 14 days in a national daily and for the affected parties to show cause why the funds would not be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government.
Weeks ago, no fewer than 21 exotic cars were confiscated from the compound of the former governor.
Yari, former chair of the Nigeria Governors Forum, is battling allegations of mismanaging the Paris Refund handout from the federal government.
