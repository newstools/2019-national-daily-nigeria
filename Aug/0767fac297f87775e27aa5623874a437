Weâ€™ve seen a few stories of couples who got married after meeting in primary school which makes us want to dredge up old yearbooks (hey Billy, are you out there? Still listening to Westlife?).

It worked out for childhood buddies Jemma Fullthorpe and Phil Allen who just got married after first meeting each other as four-year-olds.

The couple met at Kingsthorpe Lower School in Northampton in 1992.

They were inseparable until Phil, 32, and his family moved to London meaning they went to different secondary schools.
