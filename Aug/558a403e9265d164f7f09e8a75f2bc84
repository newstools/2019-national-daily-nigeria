The 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham is set to be the first major multi-sports event to have more women’s than men’s medal events after three sports were added to the programme, National Daily learnt.
Women’s Twenty20 cricket, beach volleyball and Para-table tennis have been confirmed as additional sports.
This means there are currently 135 women’s medal competitions scheduled, compared to 133 for men.
National Daily learnt that Birmingham will also have the largest Commonwealth Para-sport programme.
There are currently seven mixed events, with the confirmed programme to be announced next year.
The three additional sports were approved by a majority of the 71 Games associations but shooting and archery have missed out, having also applied to be added to the event.
India boasts a distinguished record in shooting  has previously said it is considering pulling out of the Games in protest at the sport’s exclusion.
