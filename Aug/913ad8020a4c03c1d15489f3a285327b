National Daily gathered from the reports making round that Alexis Sanchez is set to end his nightmare spell at Manchester United by returning to Italy after being threatened with axe. The Chilean forward has suffered a difficult 18 months at Old Trafford following his move from Arsenal
 
Sanchez made his name with Udinese eight years ago and is ready to return to Serie A with Juventus, Napoli, AC and Inter Milan all interested in the striker.
 
Although United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claimed recently that he expects Sanchez to remain at Old Trafford, they are open to offers for the Chilean flop.
Sanchez does not figure prominently in Solskjaer’s plans and the Norwegian wants to give more game time to Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Daniel James and teenage forward Mason Greenwood.
Sanchez, 30, who has scored just three goals in 32 United games, has just returned to training after an extended lay-off because of his involvement in the Copa America and is keen to leave in search of regular football
Sanchez scored 12 Serie A goals in his final campaign with Udinese and is still respected in Italy, where the transfer window remains open until September 2.
However, Roma have cooled their interest after being keen on the South American and it is understood he was not happy with their offer.
Sanchez’s agent Fernando Felicevich met Juventus officials in May and the Italian champions, together with Napoli, AC and Inter Milan, would consider signing him on loan.
United would prefer a permanent deal to get Sanchez’s hefty salary off their wage bill and would probably have to subsidise any Ioan.
Yet they will listen to any loan offers with a commitment to buy Sanchez next summer.
Recall that it was recently alleged that Sanchez could be banished to the reserved team if he does not move on from United.
