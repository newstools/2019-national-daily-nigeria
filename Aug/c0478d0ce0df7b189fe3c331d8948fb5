Governor Emeka Ihedioha has accused his predecessor of stealing N1trillion while in power in Imo.
According to a statement on Friday issued by his Special Adviser on Media, Steve Osuji, available records show that in eight years, former GovernorRocha  Okorocha mismanaged about One Trillion Naira belonging to Imo State.

“We are taking our time in unveiling the numerous atrocities of the last administration and certainly, he must answer for all the evil he did against the people of Imo State,” he said.


Taking time to dismiss all the allegations Okorocha levelled at Ihedioha recently, Osuji said no amount of lies can discourage the PDP governor who displaced the ruling party in the last general election.


“The truth is that Okorocha wrecked Imo State. All he is doing is to attempt to divert the attention of Imo people. Unfortunately, Imo people are smarter than that.

The EFCC started probing the former governor’s eight-year rule months ago–though he insists it s the handiwork of his party chairman Adams Oshiomhole.
