OYO State Governor Seyi Makinde has explained why his administration reversed the appointments of 17 permanent secretaries made at the twilight of Governor Abiola Ajimobi’s administration.
The governor said the decision became imperative because of the revelations that due diligence was not followed in the appointments.
He noted that when he came on board, he had to set up machinery to review the appointment and why it was done “hastily”.
Makinde said it was discovered that a lot of irregularities were involved in the process that led to the appointments of the permanent secretaries.
Although 15 people were shortlisted, only 14 took the oath of office and allegiance administered on them by the Director of Cabinet, Mr. Fatai Omokemi.
Five women and nine men were on the list of the appointees.
They include Mrs. Olubunmi Oni, Mr. Fatai Oladeinde, Mrs. Adejoke Eyitayo, Mrs. Sadiat Oloko and Mr. Joel Ajagbe.
Others are Mr. Olayinka Alli, Mrs. Abosede Abioye, Mr. Adebowale Balogun, Mr. Ademola Ajibola and Dr. Mufutau Ayoola.
It also includes Dr. Mercy Popoola, Mr. Akin Funilayo, Mr. Adeyanju B.A and Mr. Gafar Bello (Accountant-General).
The event got emotional when the governor announced Ajagbe, who was said to have climbed all the rungs of the civil service ladder but was never appointed as permanent secretary as well as the case of Alli, who was mandated to retire three days after he was appointed Perm Sec.
