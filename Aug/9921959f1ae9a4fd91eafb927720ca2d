The president of the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria, CIIN, Eddie Efekoha, has lauded the Institute’s commitment to its duty as the rallying point for insurance professionals in Nigeria.
Efekoha gave the commendation at a media parley to herald the Institute’s 60th anniversary celebration in Lagos, saying that the CIIN was set to commemorate the anniversary with a schedule of activities lined up to acknowledge the Institute’s contribution to the development of manpower in the country in the past 60 years.
He said that the anniversary celebration provides all stakeholders of the Institute and the insurance industry, an opportunity to reflect on the history of the Institute and equally embrace the Institute’s relevance in the insurance sector and the Nigerian economy.
Richard Borokini, the director general of the institute, said that the anniversary celebration was billed to run from Friday, August 2nd, 2019 to Thursday 8th, 2019. The line up of activities will kick off with a Jumat Service on the 2nd August at the Lagos State Central Mosque Alausa and the CIIN family Picnic on the 3rd of August at the Eleko beach.
The Celebrations continue on the 5th of August with Charity visits to selected charity homes and there will be a symposium on the 6th of August at the Muson center themed “The Nigerian State and values: Need for Alignment”. There is Church Service scheduled for the All Saints Anglican Church on the 7th August and the week-long schedule of activities will come to a climax with a Gala Night and the launch of the Institute’s compendium on the 8th of August.
It will be recalled that the Insurance Institute of Nigeria was established in 1959 and charged with the responsibility of determining the standards of knowledge and skills to be attained by persons seeking to become insurance professionals in Nigeria.
