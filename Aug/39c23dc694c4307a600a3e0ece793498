Niger Tornadoes goalkeeper Mustapha Aliko has urged his colleagues to show more attitude which he claims was missing in the 1-2 home loss to Guinea’s Santoba in Saturday’s CAF Confederation cup qualifying round defeat.

National Daily gathered that Conakry side weren’t any special ,but showed more attitude against Tornadoes where his colleagues struggled to show conviction of a team ready to play continental football.

He told our reporter during a chat  that they will have to work better on this to overturn the huge deficit before them ahead of the away fixture.

Aliko added that we are not happy over our performance , but  thank God we have some good coaches and management to help us through this to talk to the players and psyche them up that it is not finished yet.


He concluded that we pray for better results in our next game.
