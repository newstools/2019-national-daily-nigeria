The APC Justice Forum/Buhari Support groups in Kogi State has called on the party to disqualify Governor Yahaya Bello over alleged double registration for the permanent voters’ cards before he jeorpardisies the APC chance in the coming governorship election..
The Forum’s Director of Media and Publicity, Mr. Atekojo Samson Usman, said the essence of the screening was to ensure that the party did not field a candidate that would be a subject of litigation.
“The allegation of double registration by Kogi State Governor late last year, which became an embarrassment to the party should not be allowed as the governor would be facing prosecution immediately he stepped down from the office,” he said in statement on Wednesday. .
The group pointed out that the offence of double registration of PVCs which Yahaya Bello committed “attracts a one-year prison term or a fine of N100,000 or both upon conviction.
“The Independent National Electoral Commission, which had sacked three of its officials for registering the governor twice last year, had said it could not take any action against the governor because he had immunity,” The group reminded the party.
According to them, that APC’s anti-corruption fight has endeared the party to Nigerians in the last five years, hence, scaling Bello in the obvious double registration scandal which some persons have been punished amount to hypocrisy and selective justice by the ruling party.
“It’s in the public domain that the governor who is also an aspirant in the forthcoming elections in Kogi State was involved in double registration scam. Some persons who were found culpable have been punished, so, what happens to the accused?”
The group urged the party’s NWC to take action in quick time looking at the threat the PDP poses in the election.
