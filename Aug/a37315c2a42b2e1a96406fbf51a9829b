Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnic (SSANIP), Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo (RUGIPO) chapter has hailed Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for ordering the reabsorption of disengaged 59 workers at the polytechnic’s staff primary and secondary schools.
Speaking with reporters in Akure, the Ondo State capital, the SSANIP chapter’s chairman, Comrade Chris Olowolade, described the mode of the sack by the management and governing council as unacceptable.
He, however, lauded Akeredolu for his timely intervention.
Olowolade accused the polytechnic’s authorities of treating the disengaged staff school’s workers like lepers.
He said: “We want to appreciate our Governor Akeredolu for directing reabsorption of the disengaged workers.
“Staff schools are an integral section of the polytechnic; the staff there are employees of the polytechnic since its creation.”
The SSANIP chairman said it was unpopular for the governing council to decide to privatise the staff school, when the school is performing optimally in both academics and extra-curricular activities.
“Education is a social responsibility and not a profit-making venture,” he said.
Olowolade added that it was unfair for the management and the governing council to treat the staff of the polytechnic staff school negatively at the crucial period of their careers.
