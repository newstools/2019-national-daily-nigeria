Liverpool winger Ryan Kent has reportedly told friends he is desperate to join Rangers on a permanent basis, following his loan spell last season. Rangers are thought to be keen on bringing the 22-year-old back to Ibrox, but a deal has yet to be agreed with the Reds.
According to Football Insider, Kent has made clear to pals his desire to head back to Glasgow this season. Kent was impressive under manager Steven Gerrard last year but headed back to Merseyside once his loan with Rangers expired.
