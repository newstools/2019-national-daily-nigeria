The EU has made its stand known on he arrest of Omoyele Sowore, the arrowhead of the planned RevoluionNow Protest, who the DSS arrested last Saturday, and will hold in detention for months.
The EU agrees democracy or any society in the world must jealously guard and make sure that such pronouncements are always non-violent and that they respect the fundamental rules of the game and democracy.
EU Amb Ketl Katsen however noted it  is for the Nigerian justice system, in the end, to follow up on specific cases.
“As long as these cases are being dealt with in the Nigerian justice system, it is not for the EU or the EU ambassador to judge what is right or wrong in these occasions,” said the ambassador in a statement on Thursday in Abuja.
Many Nigerians, including older revolutionary and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, rights Lawyer Femi Falana, and tribal groups ike the Afenifere and Ohaneze, have condemned the federal government action as unacceptable in a saner society.
These critics might have expected the EU and other world bodies to take a hard line against the administration of President Muhammadu Bhari on this.
The envoy added that the European Union stands firm on the principles of freedom of speech and other fundamental values.
Of course, it is important in any democratic society for people to be able to participate.”
