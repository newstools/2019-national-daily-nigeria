Stoke City have confirmed that striker Saido Berahino has left the club by mutual agreement. The 26-year-old joined Stoke from West Brom in January 2017 but managed just five goals in 56 appearances with the Potters. Berahino had three years left on his five-and-a-half-year contract with Stoke.
Also, Everton has confirmed loan deal for Sidibe. Everton have confirmed the signing of right-back Djibril Sidibe on a one-year loan from Monaco. The Toffees will pay a €2.5 million (£2.31m/$2.8m) loan fee with a €14 million (£12.92m/$15.7m) option to buy in the summer. Sidibe was a member of France’s World Cup-winning squad in 2018.
