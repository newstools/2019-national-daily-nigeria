No fewer than 300 militants from the southeast and southsouth were going to clash with Ijaw youth that besieged a hotel where a secessionist meeting with former warlord of the Niger Delta Peoples Volunteer Force in Bayelsa was going on Saturday.
Asari Dokubo was reported by the Nation to have convened the meeting under the umbrella of the Biafra National Council.
But the chairman of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC), Central Zone, Kennedy Olorogun, knew about the meeting, and mobilized Ijaw youths to the venue—to disrupt the meeting.
Olorogun was angry with Dokubo for choosing Bayelsa to hold such meeting.
He ordered Dokubo to leave the state or face the wrath of the youths.
“They tried to resist us but we told them we were prepared for them because we will not allow any part of Bayelsa to be used for a meeting calling for the actualisation of Biafra,” the Ijaw youth leader told the newspaper.
“It was getting out of hand but the police intervened to stop possible violence. My happiness is that we stopped the meeting from holding,” he told journalists.
There have been debates going on about the stake of the Niger Delta in the the Biafra agenda.
While the southsouth governors have publicly denounced any pact with secessionist groups like IPOB or MASSOB that seek the actualization of an independent Igbo nation, militants like Asari Dokubo and others have showed interest.
