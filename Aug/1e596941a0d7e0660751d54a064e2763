A top aide to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in the last presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, Kassim Afegbua, says President Muhammadu buhari and his All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government should be held responsible for pushing Nigerians beyond limit, hence the need for RevolutionNow protest.
Recall that the Department of State Services, DSS, had picked up Omoyele Sowore, former presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC, over the weekend for calling for Revolution Now protest.
Despite Sowore’s arrest, the RevolutionNow protest held in some states on Monday with many of the protesters arrested by the police.
Afegbua, a spokesman for Atiku Abubakar Campaign, while appearing on Channels Television on Tuesday, said the APC led-Federal Government under Buhari pushed Nigerians into agitating for a revolution due to its bad governance.
He.     said: “If you look at the blueprint of the RevolutionNow, they are asking for quite a number of very salient “But for the failure of government, for the failure of the All Progressives Congress-led government in certain critical sectors of the nation’s economy, both politics and the welfare of the people, this RevolutionNow is beginning to gain attention in the minds of the people.
“If things were right, if the APC could sit down and provide governance if they can govern the country very well, people will not be agitating for things like RevolutionNow.”
