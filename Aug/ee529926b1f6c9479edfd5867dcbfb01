Former governor of Lagos Akinwunmi Ambode, has denied stashing away the N9.9bn fraud the EFCC claimed it discovered in he state government account.
According to him, none of his accounts contained N9.9bn—and none has been frozen by the EFCC, adding that his record was clear.
His media aide, Habib Aruna, said in a statement that Ambode did not intend to join issues with the anti-corruption agency since there had been no communication between him and the commission on the issue.
Clarifying issues, he said the accounts frozen by the Federal High Court belong to the Lagos State Government and not him or any individual.
“Those accounts were opened in the course of normal operations by the Lagos State Government for its administrative purposes and not for the former governor’s personal transactions as was being wrongly insinuated and have been operated to ensure smooth operations of government activities by previous and present administrations.
“The former governor was not and will never be involved in any unauthorized use of government property and resources.
“We strongly believe that after four demanding years as Chief Executive of Lagos State, Mr. Ambode is entitled to some deserved rest with his family and loved ones without the unwarranted attacks on his well-earned reputation,” the statement said.
