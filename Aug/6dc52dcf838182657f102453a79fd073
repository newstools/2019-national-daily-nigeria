Five pastors of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) were kidnapped Thursday along the Ijebu-Ode axis on their way to attend the church’s conference at the RCCG City, along the Lagos Ibadan expressway
RCCG’s General Overseer Pastor Enoch Adeboye announced the abduction on Friday.
He urged the congregation to pray for the release of the abductees.
Adeboye noted that it was the first time such incident of that magnitude was happening.
“As a father, how do you think I should feel to hear that five of my children have been kidnapped while on their way to attend the Ministers Conference?” he asked.
The rate of kidnapping in the southwest of Nigeria has been on the upswing, and the traditional rulers of the region have been agitating–as far s As Rock–to stem the tide.
President Muhammadu Buhari, in their last meeting with the traditional rulers, said soldiers, drones, and community police will soon be deployed in the black spots and forest where the bandits hide.
