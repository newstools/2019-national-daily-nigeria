National Daily gathered from the report made available by Sky Sports transfer reporter, Kaveh
Solhekol that Real Madrid’s rejected bid for Paul Pogba proves that the Los Blancos do not have
the funds to meet Manchester United’s £150m valuation of their French midfielder..
Real Madrid made a first official offer for the World Cup winner at the weekend of €30m
(£27.6m) plus outcast James Rodriguez, which was flatly rejected by United.
“It was a ridiculous bid, I don’t think Manchester United would have taken it seriously,” Solhekol
said on Sky Sports’ Transfer Show.
“It’s something they would have laughed off. Maybe Real Madrid were just testing the water
with it to see what Manchester United would do.
“But Manchester United have made it very clear he is not for sale and secondly if they were to
sell him he would cost £150m.
“Offering James Rodriguez and €30m tells you that Real Madrid cannot afford Paul Pogba.
“They’ve spent too much money already this summer, around £250m, and the only way they
could afford him is if they sell Gareth Bale.”
