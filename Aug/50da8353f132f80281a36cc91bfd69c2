The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) is crying out loud that the US security operatives are working with Nigeria’s to frustrate the medical treatment of their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, in India.
El-Zakzaky and his wife, tailed by Nigerian security operatives, flew out of Nigeria on Monday, based on a leave granted by a Kaduna High Court.
Abdullahi Musa, the secretary of the Academic Forum of the movement alleged that the federal government and some “security operatives working for the US” were conniving to ensure that the IMN leader would not be treated.
America’s CIA agents are often involved in international clandestine operations. And the current psychological war going on between the US and Iran, the headquarters of Shiite Muslims around the world may have spilled over to the relationship between Nigeria and El-Zakyzaky.
Musa said the management of Madenta Hospital, New Delhi, had been threatened not to admit him for treatment.
“Reports reaching us from the hospital indicate that the security agents are colluding with foreign security agents believed to be working for American government,” he said in a press statement on Tuesday.
“Even before the Sheikh arrived the hospital, we gathered from competent source that officials of American embassy in India instructed management of the hospital not to admit the Sheikh for treatment.
“The source added that even as the doctors were enthusiastically waiting to receive the Sheikh to save his life, the American secret agents have threatened the hospital officials not to go ahead to treat the Sheikh at the hospital,” the statement read.
The group called on the international community and “people of conscience” to prevail on the Nigerian government and its “western masters”, to stop playing with El-Zakzaky’s life.
India was one of the 187 countries whose doctos wrote the federal government recetlyto reease the Shiite leader detained since 2015 by the DSS.
