The Gunners have been locked in transfer talks with the Hoops over the 22-year-old for weeks.
They are still waiting on an offer being accepted for the £25m-rated Scotland international.
However, National Daily gathered that those hopes have been boosted as Neil Lennon’s club are
closing on his replacement.
Celtic are keen on attacking defender Henry, 22.
The former England U20 ace has battled back from injury problems to star for the Bees.
Brentford would want a fee of around £7m for Henry.
And they have been chasing a replacement themselves in case he goes.
The West London club have inquired about Max Lowe at Derby.
And they have also targeted Vitesse Arnhem’s Max Clark as they prepare for the worst.
Meanwhile, Arsenal boss Unai Emery says his summer spending is over unless he can land
someone who will significantly improve his team.
He said: “It has not changed, our idea and our message. Only if we can sign a player who really,
really can improve our squad, then we are going to do that.
“If not, then not. We have good competitive players to achieve or try to achieve our target this
season and we are going to be looking at something if we can sign someone, but with this idea.
Only, and only, if we can improve.”
The Gunners face Newcastle in the opening game of the Premier League season on Sunday.
