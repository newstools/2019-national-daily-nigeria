The Lagos State House of Assembly, on Monday, refused to confirm three out of the 38 nominees of Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu for appointment as commissioners and special advisers.
He is he first governor among the freshly minted whose nominees were not all confirmed.
The House rejected Ms Adekemi Ajayi-Bembe, Mr Obafemi George and Prince Olanrewaju Sanusi, during the confirmation at its plenary.
The confirmation followed the presentation, debate and adoption of the report of the House’s 16-man ad hoc committee for the screening of the nominees.
The report was laid and presented by the Chairman of the committee, Mr Rotimi Abiru, the Chief Whip of the House.
After a voice vote on each nominee by the Speaker, the House confirmed 35 out of the 38 nominees as commissioners and special advisers-designate.
“In pursuant to the Section 192 subsection 2 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), the House now confirms the appointment of the following governor’s nominees,” said Obasa.
The speaker directed the Clerk of the House, Mr Sanni Azeez, to forward the list of the confirmed nominees to Gov. Sanwo-Olu.
He said that the governor could still re-nominate those rejected by the House, if he so desired.
The House adjourned plenary until Aug. 27.
