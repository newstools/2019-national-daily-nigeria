felicitates with Lagosians, PDP members



A Chieftain and former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Otunba Segun Adewale popularly known as (Aeroland), has called on all Lagos Muslim faithful to imbibe the true spirit of selflessness, tolerance and love towards one another, as being demonstrated by Prophet Mohammed (SAW) as they celebrate this year Eid-el-Kabir
He said a period like this should be used by all Muslims to intercede and pray to God almighty, to restore peace, unity and progress to the State, urging all to emulate the good teachings of Allah.
Adewale charged all members of the Lagos PDP celebrating the Eid-el-Kabir, not to forget to use this opportunity to pray to God, to restore peaceful co-existence amongst members, that only when a genuine reconciliation and soul searching is done in accordance to Allah’s teachings, then the unity and progress will lead it to political prosperity.
Adewale urged members of the Lagos PDP to overcome their fears and anxieties and rather, embrace resolves to move forward to build a robust party where goals and aspirations are met, urging them to remember the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) which encouraged strong commitment to the development of our society.
“The Eid-el-Kabir afford us the opportunity to share love with all including the less privileged, which are core basis towards a better society and we must hearken to them jealously.”
“Though, it’s a moment of celebration but we need to remind ourselves to imbibe the culture of tolerance and selfless service to humanity as the holy prophet had encouraged us.” Adewale said.
He also enjoined lagosians to re-dedicate themselves to the struggle for the emancipation of the State as they reflect on the ideals and teachings of Allah,while wishing PDP members, the good people of the state and the entire Muslim community a Happy Eid-el-Kabir celebration.
