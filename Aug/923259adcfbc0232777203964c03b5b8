National Daily gathered that Alexis Sanchez has confirmed his move to Inter Milan after posting a farewell message to his Man Utd teammates.
Meanwhile, he also said his goodbye with this adorable picture with his ‘former’ teammates, a gesture that has left United fans in awe.
The Chilean striker is heading back to the Serie A where he spent three seasons previously after agreeing a loan switch from the Red Devils.
Sanchez brings to an end a disappointing spell at United having scored just five goals in 45 appearances since his switch from Arsenal last January.
The 30-year-old was the top earner at Old Trafford with United now set to subsidise some of his £500k-per-week wages in order for him to move to the San Siro.
Sanchez’ departure leaves United desperately short of back-up for his front-line, with 17-year-old Mason Greenwood the only other recognised striker in the first-team squad.
Sanchez could be thrown straight into first-team duty at Inter for their second Serie A fixture of the season away to Cagliari on Sunday.
He previously played in the division for three years at Udinese prior to moving to Barcelona..
