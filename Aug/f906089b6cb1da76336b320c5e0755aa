The Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to review the security architecture in the face of the numerous security challenges facing the country.

Chairman of the association in Kano State, Reverend Samuel Adeyemo made the call during his remark at the “Pastors Solemn Assembly for the Peace and Security of the Church at Believers Fellowship Baptist Church, Kano.
Adeyemo cited insurgents’ attacks in the North East as well as the wave of banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery on the highways in other parts of the country as basis for the appeal and the prayers.
The CAN chairman specifically observed that God has been merciful to the city of Kano by shielding it from the growing wave of insecurity.
According to him:”The wave of kidnapping, herdsmen killings,armed robbery, attacks on our highways and the insecurity in nation prompted us to call for these prayers. Muslims and Christians must rise up and pray.
Secondly, let the security apparatus of the nation, that is the federal government need to reshuffle the security apparatus,let them review it, because we have the expertise, we have the materials to restore the nation’s security.”
He noted that coming together of all the pastors in the state for a solemn prayer on security was an acknowledgement of the protection of God and a prayer for the sustenance of the peace.
The clergyman, however, appreciated the efforts of the Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and the various security agencies for their roles and urged them to redouble their efforts.
