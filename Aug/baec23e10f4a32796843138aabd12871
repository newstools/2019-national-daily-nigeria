There are emerging indicators that Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has been thrown into deep fear as the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja appointed Hon. James Abiodun Faleke, lawmaker representing Ikeja federal constituency in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly, Chairman of the APC Governorship Screening Committee that will be screening all the governorship aspirants of the party in Kogi State for the November 2019 governorship election.
National DailyÂ learned that Governor Bello and his supporters became jittery, protesting that Faleke is has vested interest in the governorship race and therefore, cannot preside over the screening of aspirants in the state.
It will be recalled that Faleke had last week declared that Bello does not deserve a second tenure, citing his failures as basis of disqualifying the governor from seeking re-election. This seems a strong ground for Governor Bello to fret over his choice to preside over the screening of APC governorship aspirants in the state.
Report indicated that Governor Bello has allegedly run to Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna State to rescue and save him from disqualification. The governor was alleged to have vowed to spend any amount to upturn the decision to appoint Faleke Chairman of the Governorship Screening Committee in Kogi State.
