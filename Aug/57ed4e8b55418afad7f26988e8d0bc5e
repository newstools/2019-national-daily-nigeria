Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher says the Reds didn’t sign Arsenal ace Nicolas Pepe as he’s too similar a player to Mohamed Salah. “Nicolas Pepe normally plays from that right-hand side, coming inside on his left foot,” Carragher said on Sky Sports.
“That’s why Liverpool never took him, there was lots of speculation. He’s basically a Mo Salah-type player really in some ways on that side, coming in on his stronger foot.”
