As the arrest of Omoyele Sowore, AAA’s former presidential candidate and publisher of Saharareporters, continues to generate uproars, President Muhammadu Buhari has come out to identify the platform pushing the revolution protests.
He also urged the sponsors, whom he described as power grabbers through undemocratic means, to come out and lead the protest themselves.
According to a statement Garba Shehu, the media aide to Buhari released on Sunday, the Global Coalition for Security and Democracy in Nigeria is the group mobilizing for revolution.
Buhari said his administration recognizes the right of every Nigerian to peaceful protest and civil campaign – whether to raise awareness on issues, and even oppose the government, noting that it is the inalienable right of all citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to do so.
“There is, however, a difference between peaceful call to protest and incitement for a revolution,” he said, adding that the organisation championing this planned action is not fronted by any serious public faces. 
“We call on the sponsors and organisers to have the decency to come forward and make their identity known – out of respect to all Nigerians – so that Nigerians can be fully aware in whose name this “revolution” is being proposed and who the beneficiaries may be.
 Narrating how he won the Feb 23 presidential election observed by international bodies, and even contested in court by losers, Buhari said the ballot box is the only democratic means of changing government.
“The days of coups and revolutions are over.”
He said Sowore and others making the “revolution’’ call are hiding behind the veil of social media modernity. 
“But without revealing the identity of their sponsors this shadowy campaign is no better, and no more democratic, than the days of old.”
