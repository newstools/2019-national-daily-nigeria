Super Eagles striker Victor Osihmen thrilled the fans as he scored two goals in his first official match for Sporting Lille in the opener of the French Ligue 1, National Daily learnt.

he said, “I am pleased and extremely delighted to have scored two goals in my first match in Lille. I have never doubted my ability to excel in football and that is exactly what I have been doing right from my childhood.

“Scoring two goals is a morale-booster for me ahead of the season. It has given me more confidence. I was so pleased to look at the crowd chanting my name. This  will spur me to do more for the club.”

“I was not under pressure, I was relaxed and the goals came. I just want to continue in that manner. I will not be carried away, I just want to do my best and to repay back the club for having the confidence to spend such a huge amount of money to acquire me to the French League”, he added.

When asked if there are any differences between the Belgian and French Leagues, he said, “well, the French League is a bit better than the Belgian League in terms of quality and organisation. I think I’m in the right place and hopefully I will justify my being here”, the former Under-17 World Cup winner concluded.
