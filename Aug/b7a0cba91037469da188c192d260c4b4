The convener of a group known as Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju has pointed out why he thinks the Peoples’ Democratic Party, PDP, 2019 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, cannot defeat President Muhammadu Buhari at the ongoing presidential election petitions tribunal.

Adeyanju claimed that Atiku cannot defeat Buhari because the president controls the three arms of government.

In a tweet on Wednesday, the activist stressed that the courts are in Buhari’s “pocket and Legislature under his feet”.

He tweeted: “Atiku is not coming anywhere. Buhari controls the 3 arms of government. The courts are in his pocket. The legislature is under his feet. Stop fooling yourself. Nigerians must have sense by force.”

Similarly, Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, had said the President would defeat Atiku at the ongoing tribunal.

Onochie had said Buhari’s defence should not take more than one hour because Atiku and his party “made it a walk in the park.”

According to Onochie: “PRESIDENTIAL TRIBUNAL: @MBuhari to open defence against @atiku on Tuesday. “Me: That shouldn’t take more than an hour or so. Atiku and @OfficialPDPNig. Team made it a walk in the park. For sure, #AtikuIsNotComing.”
