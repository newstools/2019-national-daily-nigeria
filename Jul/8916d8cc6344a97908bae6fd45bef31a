The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), says most of the ministerial nominees by President Muhammadu Buhari have corruption charges on them, advising the senate to send their names to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).

In a statement signed by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said the screening exercise would enabled the Senate to further confirm that many of the nominees include individuals, who as former governors and ministers, wrecked their states and ministries and have serious allegations of corruption, abuse of office and stealing of public funds hanging on their necks.

The party added: “This is particularly as President Buhari had asserted that he would only nominate persons he knows “personally”.

“It therefore speaks volumes that the persons Mr. President “personally” knows and has nominated as ministers include such individuals that have been publicly indicted and known to be answering questions as accomplices in on-going corruption cases in various courts.

“The Senate to note that some of the nominees have failed to defend their corruption allegations. This includes a particular former minister from the North Central, who had admitted to the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) of complicity in the N2.5 billion National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) fraud case, still pending in court.

“This is in addition to certain nominees who, as state governors, swindled their states, fleeced workers and committed several financial crimes for which they should rather be standing trial, instead of being rewarded with official protection as ministers.

“Our party notes that the gathering of corrupt persons as cabinet ministers is a clear pointer to a scheme by the cabal in the Presidency to further entrench corruption in our nation.”

Urging the Senate to take a cursory look into the allegations of “bribe-for-ministerial-slot,” making the rounds in the public space, the PDP said the Senate must “rise to the occasion and ensure that Nigerians are not totally let down.”

PDP also enjoined the Senate to note that “President Buhari has not demonstrated any commitment to the fight against corruption and for that reason, Nigerians now look up to the National Assembly to protect the nation from the excesses of the Buhari Presidency.

“The Senate is therefore urged to stand with the people in resisting the manipulations of the Buhari Presidency to ensure that only persons with clean records are cleared as ministers.”
