Tank farm owners operating within Oriade Local Government Development Area of Lagos State, have refuted claims by certain individuals who staged a protest saying that they were unprofessional in their conducts .
The Secretary of Ijegun-Egba Tank farm Owners and Operators Association, Barr. Eshiet E. Eshiet ,who spoke to newsmen in reaction to the protest highlighted efforts tank farms owners have put in place to ease the life of residents, contrary to the standpoint of the protesters.
 “Its out of place to say we are unprofessional , we do our job as a professional in the oil and gas sector, having participated in downstream sector of the oil and gas industry for several years with fantastic track records, in line with international best practices.
” We have worked assiduously to maintain and rehabilitate Marwa Road and reconstruct Pioneer Road, construct drainages, build culverts etc.
“Rehabilitation and reconstruction works are ongoing on Marwa Road and Pioneer Road respectively, including desilting of the gutters of Marwa Road for free flow of water to the Lagoon.
“We have also commenced the process of building a Central Fire Station with state of the art facilities to service the Tank farm and environs.
“The design, drawings and specifications of the projects are being handled by the Lagos State Government. We are awaiting necessary approval to commence work.”
The legal luminary Barr. Eshiet however, appealed to Oriade communities to exercise patience with them as work  is ongoing on the roads , drainages and culverts .
