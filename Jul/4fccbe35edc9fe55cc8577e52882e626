Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has taken fresh swipe on President Muhammadu Buhari over the controversial RUGA settlement policy that has been generating tension across the country. The former president ridicules President Buhari that in the midst of socio-economic crises where there are no refineries, electricity, employment, etc, President Buhari is disbursing $11 billion on Fulani Ruga.
Former President Obasanjo was cited to have declared: “no refineries, no electricity, no jobs, killings and poverty everywhere but Buhari’s major priority is to spend $11 billion on Fulani Ruga.
Dr. Obasanjo had at the Ninth Toyin Falola annual international conference at Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, decried that many Nigerians are unhappy and want to leave the country. The former President had warned that Nigeria might not move forward if the country continued to lose its identity to diversity.
“When you mismanage diversity with impunity, it is, particularly, annoying. It can lead to what we may not want it to lead to.
“I don’t know of any Nigerian who doesn’t wish Nigeria well, but I know many Nigerians who are unhappy and want to leave Nigeria. Our issue is so because what they expect from Nigeria they are not getting it,” had declared.
