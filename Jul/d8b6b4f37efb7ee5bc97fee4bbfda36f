A brother of the late Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of the Afenifere leader Reuben Fasoranti, has given his own account of the incident since his sister died in his hands at the hospital.
Kehinde’s report, however, was not assertive of the perpetrators—as the group spokesman Yinka Odumakin’s, which said Fulani herdsmen were the killers.
According to the younger Faturoti, the incident occurred hours after his sister visited their 93-year-old father, who had not fully recovered from the death of one of his daughters.
“Her [Funke] vehicle was ambushed around Ore town. The gunmen started shooting at them at the Ore expressway and the driver had to quickly turn back but unknown to him there are some of them in the bush along the other side of the road,’ he told newsmen in Akure Saturday.
“They shot at the tyres of the SUV she was travelling in along with other persons. There were five people in the car, a driver, herself, a cook and two of her nephews.
“Sadly, she was hit by a bullet and was rushed to a hospital but she lost too much blood and she died minutes after.”
He added that by the time the police would respond, about 30 minutes later, the gunmen had gone back into the bush. 
“They ran after hearing the sound of the patrol van. Nobody was kidnapped inside her own vehicle.
“Although, those who were wounded were rushed to a hospital and have been checked by doctors and they are fine.”
 President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the police to get down to the root of  the killing, which his media aide Femi Adesina said was carried out by armed robber, going b the Ondo police command report.
