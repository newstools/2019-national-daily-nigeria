Human rights lawyer Femi Falana has said that the Senate ad hoc committee probing Sen. Elisha Abbo was wrong to have questioned the lawmaker on Tuesday.
According to Falana, although the Senate had the right to discipline its members, Abbo could not be questioned because the matter was already in court and questioning him now would amount to sub judice.
  Abbo had already been arraigned before a magistrate court for assault at a sex-toy shop in Abuja days ago, he pleaded not guilty, and got bail.
The senior advocate told the Punch that the Senate rules clearly state that when a matter is before a court of law, the Senate cannot discuss it.
“It is, therefore, wrong for the Senate to sit and investigate a matter publicly while the matter is ongoing in court. That is sub judice.
“The Senate rules are clear that when a matter is in court, the Senate does not dabble into it,” he said.
The Senate ad hoc committee was headed by Senator Sam Egwu of Ebonyi, and has as its members Lagos Central lawmaker, Senator Tinubu, Senators Stella Oduah of Anambra North, Mathew Urhoghide, Dauda Aliu Jika,  Sani Musa, and Danladi Sankara.
The committee was asked to submit its report within two weeks.
Abbo is a first timer in the upper chamber.
Many saw the Senate pre-judicial action as trying to impress Nigerians the ninth assembly is proactive.
