Amid claims Barcelona will meet with Neymar’s representatives tomorrow, reports in Spain claim the Paris Saint-Germain forward will refuse to train in order to force a move.
The Brazilian winger is believed to want out of Paris after two years and Spanish newspaper Sport say Neymar has refused to join his PSG team-mates for pre-season training which gets underway next week ahead of their first friendly on July 16.
The 27-year-old joined the Ligue 1 champions from Barca in 2017 for a world-record £198m and is now thought to want to return, though Barca are also soon expected to confirm a big-money move for Antoine Griezmann.
Journalist Marcelo Bechler of Brazilian outlet Esporte Interativo says Neymar’s father and lawyer will touch down in Barcelona for talks with Barca’s South American director Andre Cury.
It’s said that a meeting will take place tomorrow and the player’s representatives are confident a deal can be struck.
Recent reports have suggested that Barcelona will use Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho as makeweights – however Esporte Interativo say PSG haven’t asked for either.
