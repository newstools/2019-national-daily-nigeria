Imo Gov Emeka Ihedioha has sent his list of 17 cabinet nominees to the state legislature for screening, and among the would-be commissioners are a former minister, a  deputy speaker, and professors.
The Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Collins Chiji, on Tuesday announced the names.
Among them a former Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Viola Onwuliri; a former Deputy Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Chuma Nnaji.
Others are Vincent Udokwu, Bon Unachukwu, Reginald Ihebuzor and Emeka Ebiliekwe; Benjamin Ekwueme, Prof Uchenna Uwaleke, Nicholas Amaefule, Chijioke Nzekwe, Ekezie Okeahialam, Meekam Mgbenwelu, Umez-Eronini Unaeze, Mrs Ibekwe Nkeiruka, Sly Enwerem, Emmanuel Nwaogu and Tony Okere.
The Speaker urged the screening committee to do a thorough job and report to the assembly.
He promised the House will support the governor all the way i his effort to develop the state.
Such cordial relationship between the executive and legislature in screening cabinet nominees mostly means rubber-stamping.
The Senate, for instance, has asked many of the federal executive nominees sent for screening to take a bow and go–in a demonstration of the Senate support for President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.
