Two witness for the ruling APC in the presidential Election Petition Tribunal told the court Wednesday that the Cambridge Assessment Education certified statement for President Muhammadu Buhari is not a certificate, and the name on the document is not exactly Buhari’s.
The document obtained from Cambridge university in London was part of the total documents presented as evidence to prove that Buhari is a true holder of WAEC.
Both  Oshideinde Henry Sunday Adewumi and Mohammed Sariki Abba denied the document as a certificate.
Also, Adewumi who is the Deputy Registrar in-charge of School examination in Nigeria said the document under cross-examination was a foundation for the issuance of a certificate.
But Adewumi, under cross-examination by the Buhari counsel, Wole Olanipekun, affirmed that University of Cambridge moderated the examination.
“That 18 students sat for the examination in 1961 and, that Buhari was listed as number 2,’ he said.
“Buhari sat for eight subjects and had five credits – Oral English (C5), History (A3), Geography (C6), Hausa (C5) and Health Science (C6).
“He came out with aggregate 32 and was awarded grade 2.
“I have been with WAEC for 30 years now”.
But when Livy Uzoukwu, lead counsel of the PDP and its candidate Atiku Abubakar asked Adewumi to spell the name of the candidate contained in the controversial result document, the deputy Registrar spelt MOHAMED, not MOHAMMADU as was expected.
Uzoukwu also found out that Buhari did not attach the relevant information expected of him before the election as a candidate in the INEC form CF001 which explicitly required information about the certificate(s) obtained and school (s) attended by the candidates.
The lawyer argued Buhari did not present his qualifying certificates to the electoral umpire as required by law.
