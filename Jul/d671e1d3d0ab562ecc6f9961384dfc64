Military sources have debunked reports of recent mass retirement in the Nigerian Army. They insisted that there has been no recent retirement of Army Officers in the Nigerian Army contrary to reports of mass retirement in the military last week.  National Daily inquiry and visit to the website of the Nigerian Army also found that there is no record of recent retirement in the Army. Dominant information on the Army website provides update on the efforts of the military to eradicate the Boko Haram insurgents in northeast Nigeria through several operations of troops in various locations of the troubled zone.
Apparently, the report on mass retirement, on investigation byNational Daily, could not be validated.
