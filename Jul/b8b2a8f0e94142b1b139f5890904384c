The national leadership, on behalf of the entire Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) family, condoled with the former Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee of the party, former Governor Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi of Kaduna State, over the death of his father, Malam Muhammad Makarfi.
Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary, in a statement in Abuja, indicated that the PDP is deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Malam Makarfi, a devoted statesman and devout Muslim, who dedicated his life to the service of God, stability and growth of the country nation and the good of humanity at large.
“Though we intensely mourn, the PDP draws solace in the fact that Malam Makarfi lived a fulfilled life and bequeathed to our nation an outstanding patriot in Senator Makarfi.
“Senator Makarfi’s commitment to national development as Governor of Kaduna State, Senator of the Federal Republic, as well as the sacrifices he made in stabilizing and repositioning our party during her trying time, speak volume of the lessons he must have received from his father.
“The PDP, therefore, condoles with the entire Makarfi family and prays the Almighty God to grant them and their loved ones the fortitude to bear this huge loss,” Ologbondiyan declared.
