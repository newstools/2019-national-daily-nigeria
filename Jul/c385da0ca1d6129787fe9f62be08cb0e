Borussia Dortmund have completed the signing of Barcelona talent Mateu Morey.
The teenage right-back, 19, has signed a five-year contract with the Bundesliga club after running down his deal at the Nou Camp.
“Borussia Dortmund are a fantastic club that places a lot of emphasis on youth. I’m confident that, with my individual qualities, I will have a lot to offer the club in the years to come,” Morey said.
“I want to integrate myself quickly, support my team and, above all, learn the language. Doing the latter will certainly make everything easier!”
