Inter coach Antonio Conte has stated that he remains confident in the club’s ability to conduct business as speculation continues to swirl over a move for Manchester United’s Romelu Lukaku.
The Serie A club have reportedly seen a €60m (£54m) bid for the Belgium international knocked back by the Red Devils, but their boss remains hopeful of bringing the forward to San Siro.
Also, Swansea hold key to £3.5m Chelsea youngster move.
Swansea City are hoping that the presence of head coach Steve Cooper will give them the edge in the race to sign Chelsea’s Kasey Palmer, reports the Daily Mail.
The Welsh outfit are up against fellow Championship side Bristol City in the battle for Palmer’s signature and they believe Cooper’s relationship with the midfielder will help.
Cooper worked together with Palmer during his time as England Under-17 manager and has strong links with the Blues.
