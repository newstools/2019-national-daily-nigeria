Super Eagles tactician,Gernot Rohr has faced intense criticism following the team unimposing outing in Egypt, but he remains unmoved as his side prepare for Cameroon, National Daily learnt.


Nigeria head coach  Rohr has attempted to quash rumours, he will be sacked after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

The German’s contract ends in 2020 and some rumours suggest he will be shown the exit door following the Super Eagles’ unimpressive recent results.

National Daily gathered that  the tactician side bowed out of the group phase of the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia, before losing to debutants Madagascar after unconvincing wins over Burundi and Guinea in Egypt.
