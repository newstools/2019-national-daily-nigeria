Antoine Griezmann has failed to return to Atletico Madrid’s pre-season preparations as he attempts to force through a Barcelona move. Griezmann announced his intention to leave Atletico Madrid at the start of the summer for the second season in a row, with Barcelona securing a deal for the forward this time around. Ernesto Valverde’s side are on hand to provide just that for the World Cup winner, but had been waiting for his release clause to drop from £190m to £107m on July 1.

A week later and Griezmann is still an Atletico player, and his frustrations at the delay have got the better of him when pre-season training began on Monday. Spanish outlet Marca have reported that Griezmann was absent as the Atletico squad set off on their trip to the nearby Los Angeles de San Rafael for training.
