Arsenal wide-man Alex Iwobi claims he may be forced to quit the club if they fulfill their ambition of signing Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace.

The Gunners have made no secret of their desire to sign the 26-year-old Ivory Coast international and have already had a bid of around £40 million ($50m) rejected for a player the Eagles value at closer to £80 million.

The presence of Zaha would limit Iwobi’s minutes at the Emirates and he says sitting on the sidelines would force hm to consider his position.


“Obviously my joy is to play football and not just sit out.

“If it comes to that I would have no choice but to leave. But I would always put up a fight to play – that is what I’ve done all my life.”
