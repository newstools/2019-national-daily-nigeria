The presidential candidate of Kowa Party in the 2019 election, Dr. Sina Fagbenro-Byron (SFB), has taken a bow from partisan politics as he has been appointed Adviser and Team Leader of the ACORN (Anti-Corruption In Nigeria) which is a UK government Department for International Development (DFID) supported program designed to strengthen the capacity and organizational coordination of enforcement agencies and the judiciary in Nigeria. The appointment was in June.

With this move, SFB who celebrated his 60th birthday on June 5, 2019 has returned to his primary constituency of international development, poverty eradication and governance consultancy.
Confirming his new appointment, he said that his first love and professional commitment was in development work and ensuring that Nigeria and its people enjoy good governance. “Whether in or out of politics, I would always be pursuing this,” he said.
Asked whether he was going to pursue his political ambitions further, he said his new appointment required strict non-partisanship and while he remains a member of KOWA party only as of right as a Nigerian citizen, he will exclude himself from all decision making processes within the party, neither will he be making any political statements or valued judgments about any political party.
