Neymar is desperate to re-join Barcelona and doesn’t want to step foot in Paris Saint-Germain’s training facility again. That’s the bold claim from Spanish newspaper Sport, who claim Neymar wants Barcelona to accelerate negotiations with the Ligue 1 champions. Sport say Neymar, 27, is growing restless with the slow pace of the transfer and has told both parties to ‘hurry up’.

The report also claims that Neymar has already agreed personal terms with the Catalan giants. The Brazilian earns a reported £635,000 per week with PSG but is prepared to accept £413,000 per week at Barcelona – close to his previous salary in 2017.

Also, in other news, French side Saint-Ettiene are keen on signing Barcelona outcast Malcom.

That’s according to Sport 24, who are reporting that Saint-Ettiene want the Brazilian winger on a season-long loan. The Ligue 1 outfit signed Sergi Palencia from Barcelona last week and used the opportunity to discuss Malcom. The 22-year-old scored one goal for the Catalan side in 15 appearances last term – and will be allowed to leave the Nou Camp for regular first-team action.
