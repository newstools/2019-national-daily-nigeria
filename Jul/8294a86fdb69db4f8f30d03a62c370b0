The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Sunday berated President Muhammadu Buhari for abandoning Nigerians to their fate and being more interested in appointing aides to serve his immediate personal comfort and necessities. The party was of the view that the president and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are not bothered about the welfare of Nigerians.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement in Abuja on Sunday sent to National Daily decried that it is highly unfortunate that at a time millions of Nigerians are hurting and suffering untold hardship due to lack of attention to critical sectors of the economy and national life, President Buhari is only concerned about his personal needs.
The PDP argued that such unpatriotic and self-centered acts, which is a direct slap on the sensitivity of the citizens, are only associated with leaders who do not have the mandate of the people but found themselves in office as beneficiaries of manipulated elections.
“That is why at the time Nigerians expect urgent interventions on critical issues of national insecurity and uncertainties; kidnapping and bloodletting; high costs of food and essential services; lack of affordable healthcare, decayed infrastructure and excruciating poverty in the land, President Buhari and his handlers are more interested in appointing house keepers and managers of social events that has only to do with him,” the Publicity Secretary declared.
The PDP, therefore, invited Nigerians to note that this development and the general lethargy in governance is a weighty effect of the validity challenge that confronts governance in the Nigeria today, following the rigging of the 2019 Presidential election.
The statement read in conclusion: “Moreover, such unseriousness further amplifies the insensitivity and incompetence of the Buhari Presidency as well as signposts the deplorable situation that might further befall the nation under the All Progressives Congress (APC).
“The PDP, however, urges Nigerians not to despair but remain resolute for the retrieval of our stolen Presidential mandate at the court, so that our dear nation will have the benefit of a serious, purposeful result-oriented administration and not an incompetent, flippant and confused government that attaches no seriousness or urgency to the exigencies of governance.”
