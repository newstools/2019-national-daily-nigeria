The U.S State Department has failed to disclose names of Nigerian politicians that will be affected by the visa restrictions imposed on politicians were involved in trying to undermine democracy in presidential and parliamentary elections this year.

The State Department had on Tuesday announced the restrictions, adding that the actions were specific to certain individuals and not directed at the Nigerian people or the newly elected government.

“These individuals have operated with impunity at the expense of the Nigerian people and undermined democratic principles and human rights,” spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

According to the statement, the decision reflects the Department of State’s commitment to working with the Nigerian government to realize its expressed commitment to end corruption and strengthen democracy, accountability, and respect for human rights.

“We commend all those Nigerians who participated peacefully in the February and March 2019 elections and have worked to strengthen Nigerian democratic institutions and processes.  As Nigeria marks the twentieth anniversary of a return to democratic rule this year, we remain committed to working together to continue to advance democracy and respect for human rights and achieve greater peace and prosperity for both our nations.  We condemn those whose acts of violence, intimidation, or corruption harmed Nigerians or undermined the democratic process.

President Muhammadu Buhari won a second term in February in an election marred by delays, logistical glitches and violence.
