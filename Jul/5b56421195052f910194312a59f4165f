There are insinuations that President Muhammadu Buhari could be compensating some All Progressives Congress (APC) members who worked as zonal presidential campaign coordinators but were defeated in their own elections with ministerial appointments.
A sources revealed that the president may have considered that gesture in order to make them remain in the politics of the country and also sustain their loyalty to strengthen his forte in the party.Â  The former Senator who represented Benue North-West senatorial zone in the National Assembly, George Akume, was identified to be top on the beneficiaries list of the president.
A Presidency source was gathered to have disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari has transmitted the ministerial nomination list to the senate for screening and confirmation. It was learned that the senate leadership received the ministerial nomination list on Tuesday but will make it public on Friday; reasons for the action was not ascertained.
It was also learned that about 40 per cent of former ministers made the list of the ministerial nomination for the new Federal Executive Council (FEC) to be constituted thereafter.
