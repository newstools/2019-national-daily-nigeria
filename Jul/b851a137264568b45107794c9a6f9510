The House Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila has announced the composition of the chairmanship of standing committees of the House, and his hardest working foot soldier got short-changed.
Hon. Abdulmummin Jibrin headed the Gbaja-Wase campaign group in the run-up to the House election in June. Many had thought the former appropriation committee chairman would be compensated for his effort with a chairmanship
But as Gbajabiamia named the chairmen of the committees during plenary on Thursday, Jibrin got zilch.
Other hopeful also got their hope shattered. And a protest broke out right after the Speaker announced the appointments.
The newly appointed committee chairmen include Muktar Betara Aliyu (APC, Borno)—for the appropriation committee; Tunji Ojo—for the NDDC committee; and James Faleke—for the Finance committee.
AbdulRasak Namdas was appointed new chairman of Committee on Army; Nicholas Mutu, for the committee on Gas Resources; Oluwole Oke, for Committee on Public Accounts; and Tajudeen Abbas, for the Land Transport Committee.
The list appears not to favour some lawmakers as several of them gathered in front of the Speaker in what appears like a protest.
