League Management Company’s hammer Dangles on Heartland Football club over Board’s interference  unless Governor  Emeka Ihedioha acts fast, Heartland football club of Owerri may likely be banned from the 2019/2020 Premier League season by the LMC following the reckless inteferences of PDP chairman board members of the club, National Daily learnt.

  This medium realiably gathered that the board was not giving the management led by the general manager  any breathing space to run the affairs of the club as recommended by LMC in its rules and regulations.

  Based  on the foregoing, the Imo State Football Association had written the LMC highlighting the unimaginable interference of the yet to be inaugurated interim board members led by the PDP chairman.  It’s public knowledge that the LMC and indeed all other football regulatory associations like NFF,  CAF and FIFA, abhor government interferance as well  politicians involvement in matters concerning football.

Indications are rife that Heartland football club of Owerri, are the worst hit in this regard following the excesses of the board members of the team who are poised to forcefully grabbing the powers of the General manager.

Insights into the activities of the board, according to this medium’s usual  checks,  stated that the yet to be inaugurated interim board would want to employ coaches, players, appoint management workers and other duties exclusively meant for the general manager. This is even as some members of the board had allegedly collected the sum of N500.000 from a coach who they pledged to employ when the board ultimately gains upper hand against the general manager.

As a matter of fact all these have put Heartland football club into a dangerous situation as the General manager cannot function adequately just as other teams elsewhere are on top of their preparations for the 2019/2020 league  season.  The league season kicks off soon and Heartland fc may not be a part of the show if LMC’s hammer falls on them based on the team’s board ill mannerd activities.
