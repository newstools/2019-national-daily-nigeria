There are indications that palpable tension has engulfed the Presidency, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal resumes on Wednesday, July 3 to deliver judgment on the application of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the party’s presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, seeking the setting aside of the June 11 judgment of the tribunal. Some stakeholders are of the view that, “hope rises for Atiku Abubakar to defeat the combined forces of darkness of Buhari, APC and INEC at the tribunal. Atiku’s evidences are watertight are too strong for Buhari and his team. It is practically impossible for Buhari to remain the president of Nigeria as all odds are against him.”
National Daily gathered that the Tribunal’s ruling this Wednesday on Atiku’s application seeking to set aside the ruling of June 11, will determine Atiku’s commencement of the presentation of the over 400 witnesses he invited to prove his petition at the tribunal.
National Daily further gathered that, “the credible witnesses include conscientious INEC staff who are battle ready to nail INEC on the Server issue; Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle experts.”
The witnesses were perceived by parties in the suit to be intimidating and equipped with technical information to expose all ill-deals perpetuated in the 2019 presidential election.
National Daily recalls that the combined legal team of President Buhari last Friday failed to scuttle the ruling on the application by the tribunal in their various arguments.
