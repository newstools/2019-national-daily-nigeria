The second term bid of Governor Yahaya Bello of kogi state got another knock on Monday as political group, Progressive Youth Alliance (PYA), says any attempt to present Bello as the APC candidate will spell doom for the party in the state.

The group which gave the warning on Monday at a press conference described the governor as “an impending danger if allowed to be the party’s flag bearer in the forthcoming Kogi gubernatorial election”.

The spokesperson of the group, Mr. Amos Alfa, told newsmen that Bello’s administration will go down in the history of Kogi State as the “most atrocious, given the backlog of debts, accrued pension, refusal to pay workers’ salary, absence of probity in the management of resources, and deficient public service management”.

He said the state currently needs is an altruistic, knowledgeable, well-rounded and an impeccable character to lead the affairs of the state.

He continued, “The present administration does not represent the yearning of the good people of Kogi State. Therefore, this negates the party principle and what the party stands for.

”It is instructive to note that he is daily depleting the goodwill of the party even beyond the borders of Kogi State.

“Contrary to public opinion that Governor Yahaya Bello set the stage for President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory during the 2019 presidential election, it was a lie peddled to undermine the effort of committed members of the party at the state and local government levels.

“It was the collective efforts of people who believed in the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari that worked assiduously to ensure the victory of the party in Kogi State,” Alfa stated.
