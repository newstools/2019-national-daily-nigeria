Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to fulfill his promise of ending banditry and killings across the country.

AYCF made the call against the backdrop of the brutal murder of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Pa Reuben Fasoranti, Afenifere leader.

In a statement on Sunday by their National President, Shettima Yerima, the Arewa youths called for the urgent arrest and prosecution of those behind Olakunrin’s death.

The statement reads in part, “The primary responsibility of a government is the preservation of lives and properties. Nigerians cannot continue to be killed with the government seemingly not making enough effort to curb armed banditry.

“It is now unfortunate that no Nigerian is safe in his own land. Travelling is now worse than a nightmare with the way lives are wasted daily on the road by bandits who also kidnap citizens at will.”

Yerima said no part of the country should be seen as more equal than others and as such, no crime should have any ethnic coloration.

“No ethnic group or part of the country is immune of criminal elements and perpetrators of crime. What we should all insist on is that government must play its part to ensure our general safety.

“We should always remind the government that Section 14 (2B) of the constitution states that ‘the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.’”
