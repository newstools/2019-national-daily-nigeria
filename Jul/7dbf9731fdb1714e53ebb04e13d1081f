Real Madrid star Marco Asensio has been stretchered from the field with a ‘worrisome’ knee injury during the penalty shootout win in the International Champions Cup against Arsenal in Maryland, National Daily learnt.

The attacking midfielder appeared to get his foot stuck in the turf during a tussle with Gunners star Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang around the hour mark, before falling to the pitch clutching his left knee.

Asensio was seen banging the turf in frustration after suffering the issue before covering his face to hide his emotion as he was removed from the pitch by medical staff – with Real coach Zinedine Zidane admitting the injury could be serious.

“It’s worrisome,” Zidane said in his post-match press conference.

“Hopefully not, but he’s gone directly to the hospital to test. It looks bad.”
