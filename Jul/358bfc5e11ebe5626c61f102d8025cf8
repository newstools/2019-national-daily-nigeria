Several stakeholders in the Nigerian project have since the public display of the ministerial nominees list President Muhammadu Buhari been questioning the anti-corruption war of the President in relation to some of the nominees on the list. There have been caustic criticisms across the country that the ministerial nominees list reflected the abandoning of anti-corruption war in Nigeria by President Buhari.
Apparently  the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on its social media platform made a metamorphic presentation of “Ministers and their corruption portfolios” wherein the party did spotlight on some of the ministerial nominees and the allegations against them.
However,National Dailyobserved that none of the state actors has been convicted by any court of law. The PDP spotlight on “Ministers and their corruption portfolios” reads as follows:
Timipre Sylva-N19bn
Lai Mohammed-N2.5bn
Babatunde Fashola-N78m
Rauf Aregbesola-N205bn
Rotimi Amaechi-N97bn
Hadi Sirika-N1.2bn
The also include some others.
The party, then, asked: “Is Corruption fighting back?”
However, the figures the party attacked to individual names are either sheer speculations or allegations that have not been investigated or prosecuted.
