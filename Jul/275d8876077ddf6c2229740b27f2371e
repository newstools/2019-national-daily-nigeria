Barcelona are relentlessly pursuing a transfer for Neymar, but Lionel Messi has asked them to think pragmatically and go for a cheaper alternative.
Barcelona are in the hunt for Neymar, who has conveyed to the Paris Saint-Germain directive that he wishes to leave the club during the summer. The Catalans have been asked to pay the Brazil international’s transfer fees in cash and that has put them in a tightrope. However, they are happy to hang on for another year or look at cheaper alternatives.
Diario GOL has reported that Lionel Messi has asked the Spanish giants to look at Bayern Munich superstar David Alaba as an option. The Austria international has been at the Allianz Arena since 2009 and with just one year left on his contract, he has told the club’s executives that he wishes to leave and has no intention of renewing.
Lionel Messi believes that Jordi Alba also needs a backup and David Alaba could be the perfect candidate. Moreover, the 27 year old is capable of playing as a left winger as well and in fact, he has been utilized in that role by Bayern Munich quite frequently by numerous coaches. He does well on free-kicks and being a left-footed left winger, Alaba can step outside and shoot on goal.
Junior Firpo was the player initially on Barcelona’s radar in their quest to sign a deputy for Jordi Alba. However, exposed tweets revealed that the Real Betis defender had insulted Messi several times on social media so the club will consider again before moving for him. Additionally, he is worth 50 million euros as opposed to Alaba- who is valued at 35 million euros.
Spain’s reigning champions have signed Frenkie de Jong and Luis Neto who are certainly going to be great additions, but their signing of Antoine Griezmann did cause a debate among the fans. The Frenchman is seen as a reactive signing to Real Madrid’s activities and one who may not fit into the squad immediately. Fans believe that those funds could be spent more frugally.
