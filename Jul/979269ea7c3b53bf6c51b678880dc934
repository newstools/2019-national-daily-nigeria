Lionel Messi could reportedly receive a two-year ban for his recent comments regarding South American footballing body CONMEBOL.

Messi, 32, was shown a controversial red card in the Copa America third-place play-off against Chile after clashing with former Cardiff star Gary Medel.

“There is no doubt, the whole thing is set up for Brazil,” Messi said. “I did not want to be part of this corruption, we shouldn’t have to be part of this disrespect we suffered during the Copa America.”

CONMEBOL rules state players cannot speak out against the football governing body.

The regulations prohibit ‘insulting in any means or manner CONMEBOL, its institutions or personnel’.

Punishment for failing to follow these rules can carry a ban of up to two years.
