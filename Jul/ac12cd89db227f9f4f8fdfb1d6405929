He confirmed that the medium of instruction “was English language and English language alone.”
He also confirmed that he and Buhari “passed the examinations in flying colours.”
On further cross-examination, retired General Tarfa identified some people in his set with whom he and Buhari were enlisted in the Army to include, Brigadier Generals Ola Oni, Duro Ajayi; Col. A.C. Ojukwu, the late Brig-Generals, Abdullahi Sellem and Shehu Musa Yar’Adua.
When asked by the counsel to INEC to confirm if “You and other course mates were asked to hand over your certificates to the Nigerian Army during your enlistment;” Tarfa responded: “There was nothing like that.”
National Daily also learned that Counsel to the petitioners, Livy Uzoukwu (SAN), after one question for the witness, thanked him “for being truthful.”
