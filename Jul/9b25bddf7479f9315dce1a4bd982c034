The Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Niger Delta, Anglican Communion, Most Reverend Tunde Adeleye has listed reasons why President Muhammadu should resign.

Speaking at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Calabar, Cross River State on Monday, the Archbishop said Buhari had failed in governance and been unable to galvanise good support from the larger majority of Nigerians for his government.

Adeleye who insisted that Adeleye insisted that as a result of poor advice and bad governance, said Nigeria had failed and could soon explode if the president remained without adhering to popular advice and yearnings.

The archbishop stated that the unity of the country must be renegotiated, stressing that restructuring was the best option.

“If I meet the president today, I will tell him in plain language that he has failed and must resign. This is because his advisers and aides have deceived him. So many things have gone wrong in this country in recent times. There is louder outcry.

“Nigeria is ripe enough for restructuring. The present structure is obsolete and carry us far. Restructuring will affect some old structures of Nigeria’s sociopolitical and economic policy.

“It will involve honest dialogue. There is now injustice, marginalisation, resulting to a failed state. We therefore, need to ‘redesign’ Nigeria,” he added.
