The management of Nationwide league one campaigners  Akure City FC of Ondo State have replied to a letter from the Chief Operating Officer of the NLO denying the match fixing allegation leveled against the Akure based team, National Daily learnt.


According to the letter earlier sent to Akure City by the NLO the team was alleged to have played a part in the scandalous matchday six result which ended 2-9 in favour of visiting Ajiroba Oni FC in Akure.



While denying the allegations Akure City FC responded that the aftermath of their matchday five fixture against Rising Stars in Akure  which saw them deducted of 3  points for encroachment despite winning the match by a lone goal resulted in the regular players of the team boycotting the match against Ajiroba Oni FC in Akure.

The reply further stated that the team resorted to using a makeshift squad  made up mainly of players of the Academy while the centre referee also issued two red cards to  Akure City players during the course of the game a situation which they said made it more difficult.


Head Coach of Akure City FC Banjo Adepoju  said his team will not descend so low to fix a match or involve in any act that will bring disrepute to the beautiful game but lamented that it was rather painful and sudden to lose three valuable points which the boys initially thought they had won.


Chairman of the team Kingsley Ossai said although the result was embarrassing there was practically nothing they could do to stop the scandalous scoreline while urging the league authorities to carry out their investigation to ascertain the truth of the matter.


It would be recalled that the week five match  between Akure City FC and Ajiroba Oni FC which was played behind closed doors ended 2-9 at the Ondo State sports complex and the NLO management had since started probing into the match.
