The Nigerian Air Force on Thursday announced its reward and appreciation for its aircraftman who returned a parcel of €37,000, about N15m, he found at theAminu Kano International Airport, Kano.
Bashir Umar, a member of the NAF Mobile Air Defence Team deployed at the airport on security duties, found the parcel during a routine patrol with some of his colleagues.
He discovered the parcel at the airport’s Hajj Camp Market on July 16, and with a telephone number he found on it, he reached the owner, one Alhaji Ahmad, and handed the parcel to him.
In recognition of his honesty, NAF then promoted Umar two levels, from aircraftman to the rank of corporal. This would have taken him ten years to achieve.
Speaking at a special event organised to honour the airman at Air Force Headquarters, Abuja, Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, said Umar displayed an uncommon act of integrity by returning the money to the owner.
He remarked that the officer also displayed the core values which the Air Force is known for.
“We hold Umar in high esteem in the Nigerian Air Force,” the air chief said.
Aside from decorating Umar with his new rank, Abubakar also gave him a letter of commendation.
In a remark earlier, the Commander, National Air Defence Corps, Ikeja, AVM Bashiru Mamman, had said that Umar displayed a rare show of honesty and integrity when he found and returned the money.
He thanked the CAS for considering Umar for an award, saying that it was gratifying and would encourage other airmen to exhibit such honesty.
Umar expressed appreciation to the Air Force authorities for honouring him with promotion and commendation.
The decision to return the money after he found, he said, was part of the discipline he got from home and in service.
