Barcelona are back in with a chance of signing Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt.
That’s according to Marca, who claim Juventus have been unable to agree a transfer fee with Eredivisie champions.
Marca claim Barcelona agreed a deal worth £67million plus performance-related add-ons – but couldn’t agree personal terms with the 19-year-old.
Juventus have the opposite problem. They have agreed personal terms with De Ligt but can’t agree a fee having offered £58m plus £9m in add-ons.
As a result, Barcelona could still bring De Ligt to the Nou Camp.
And for Arsenal deal agreed Nacho Monreal has signed a new one-year deal with Arsenal.
That’s according to the Sun who claim the 33-year-old will remain at the Emirates Stadium until June 2020.
Rumours had been circulating that the Spanish full-back was heading back to Spain but a seventh season in north London looks sorted.
Arsenal have yet to officially announce the deal but it is expected in the next few days.
