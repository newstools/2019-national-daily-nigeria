UEFA has confirmed this season’s Champions League will pay out an incredible £1.75billion. The eye-watering figure is sure to be music to the ears of all sides playing this term. There will be four Premier League sides competing for Europe’s top prize. And Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Spurs will automatically receive £14m each after reaching the group stage.

Also David Luiz has extra motivation to impress new boss and former Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard in a more united Blues set-up. In the defender’s first stint at the club, the pair won the Champions League and Europa League together – and the Brazilian reckons there could be more glory ahead. And the 32-year-old is ready to take on extra responsibility to aid his new boss.

Luiz told the club website: “It’s great to see him here.

“He’s someone who knows what it means to be at Chelsea and understands the DNA of this club. We are working well so far, everyone is getting along and the sessions have been great.

“Lamps, or should I say ‘Gaffer’, is now our leader and he’s going to try to do everything he can like he did when he was a player, and now it’s up to us to help him build the spirit and the philosophy around the club to be successful.”
