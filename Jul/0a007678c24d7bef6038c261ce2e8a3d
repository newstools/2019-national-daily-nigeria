As the murder of Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Afenifere leader, Reuben Fasoranti, continues to generate controversies and tension over the alleged involvement of Fulani herdsmen across the country, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has cautioned against hasty conclusions in accusing Fulani herdsmen of being responsible for the death.
National Daily learned that MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, in a statement called on Nigerians to exercise patience over linking any group to the murder until the conclusion of the police investigations, appealing that Nigerians should avoid ethnic stigmatization.
Prof. Akintla in the statement declared: “It is necessary at this point to warn Nigerians against spreading fake news or jumping to conclusions. We must not allow those who have a hidden agenda to destroy this country.
“Earlier reports had said that the killers were Fulani herdsmen.
“But the police who arrived at the scene early enough to rescue seven of the abducted victims said the identity could only be disclosed after the culprits have been apprehended.”
The MURIC Director remarked that the Benin-Ore road is notorious for kidnapping and armed robbery; noting that anybody can fall victim.
“Let us face the criminals and not any particular tribe.
“There are criminal elements in all tribes, just as there are good citizens all over this country. There is nothing like a siege by one tribe on another because kidnapping and armed robbery are crimes happening everywhere,” he said.
