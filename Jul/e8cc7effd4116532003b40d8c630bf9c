One thousand supporters drawn  from each of  the 44 local government in Kano state have been recruited to  cheer Kano Pillars to victory  at the finals of this year’s edition of Aiteo cup schedule to hold in Kaduna.

National Daily learnt that the chairman, Kano Pillars Fans club, Bashir Muazu(Jide) disclosed that preparations  to ferry the fans to Ahmadu Bello stadium venue of the final match have been completed.

According to him, aside the anticipated 44 thousand supporters  expected to be at the crucial game,  thousands of independent sympathizers would hit the road to Kaduna to give support to their darling side.

He though expressed fear over the presence of a huge crowd at the game,  he said the situation might be uncontrollable, “we had similar experience in Lagos, where those who were just sympathetic to our course, misbehaved and the football authorities tagged them to be members of our fans cub and punished us for their erring.

“we want to state categorically that, we are aware ABS is a 30, 000, seating facility, we have registered fans that are going to Kaduna and they are humble and law abiding, there are other thousands unregistered sympathizers, beware  some would even trek to Kaduna for the game, this we cannot control, but we are appealing to our sympathizers to always comport themselves in line with the spirit of fair play.” Bashir  appealed .


He further said “we lost  in the  final last year to Enugu Rangers, this time, we have worked hard, we must commend the players and coaches for a job well done, we have a continental ticket in our pocket and we will ice the cake with the Aiteo coveted trophy.”
