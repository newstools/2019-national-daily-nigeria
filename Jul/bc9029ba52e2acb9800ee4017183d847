Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will deliver the 70th Anniversary Lecture of the Lagos Country Club on July 30.
Club President Chief Tajudeen Akande said the Vice President will be supported by eminent personalities in government, the business community as well as diplomats.
He said: “The Vice President has graciously accepted to deliver our anniversary lecture holding in our Jubilee Hall on July 30. It is a great honour for us because apart from being the Vice President, he is eminently qualified as an erudite lawyer and intellectual of high repute. And I am happy that he will be speaking to Nigerians, considering that Lagos Country Club is a mini-Nigeria populated by Nigerians of diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds.”

“Our grand ball holds on August 3, which is our Founder’s Day, and it is billed to witness crème-de-la-crème of the society in Nigeria and across the world. This is the biggest event in the history of social/sporting clubbing in Nigeria and we are leaving no stone unturned, Akande added.’’
