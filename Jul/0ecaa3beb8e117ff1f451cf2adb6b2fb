An Ikeja Chief Magistrate Court on Monday ordered that a 28-year-old teacher, Idowu Daniel be remanded in Kirikiri Prisons for allegedly defiling a 17-year old secondary student.

The Chief Magistrate, Olufunke Sule-Amzat, who did not take the plea of the defendant, ordered the police to send the case file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice.

The defendant, who lives at Abule-Egba area of Lagos, is facing a charge of defilement.

Earlier, the Prosecutor, ASP Benson Emuerhi told the court that the defendant on June 27 at 9.25am unlawfully had carnal knowledge of his student in the Biology Laboratory at Anastasia Comprehensive College, Abule-Egba, Ikeja.

“The teacher lured the student into the school’s Biology lab and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her,” the prosecutor said.

According to him, the offence contravenes the provisions of Section 137 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015.


Sule-Amzat adjourned the case until Oct. 21.
