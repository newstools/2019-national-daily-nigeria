The Hammers have been looking to bring in a new frontman this summer, with Andy Carroll and Marko Arnautovic moving on.

They had been targeting Maxi Gomez but have been unable to agree a deal with Celta Vigo.

Now, according to The Mail, West Ham are close to securing the signature of Frankfurt’s Sebastien Haller.

Talks are said to have rapidly progressed this week over a £36m deal and the striker is ready to pen a four-year contract.
