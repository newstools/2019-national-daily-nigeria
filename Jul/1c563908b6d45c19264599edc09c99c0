The President of the United States,Donald Trump, at the weekend declared war against President Emmanuel Macron of France over America’s interest in global trade. President Trump protested imposition of digital tax on US technology, arguing that such tax can only be collected by the home government.
President Trump in his official twitter handle, @realDonaldTrump, wrote: France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly. I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine.”
