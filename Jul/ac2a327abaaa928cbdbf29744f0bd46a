Manchester United have anointed Saul Niguez as Paul Pogba’s replacement, according to Spanish publication AS.
The Madrid-based newspaper claims Old Trafford chiefs and Solskjaer have settled on Saul as their No 1 central midfield target and have already contacted Los Rojiblancos over a deal.
It will be a tough negotiating process, though, with the Wanda Metropolitano club already losing Diego Godin, Juanfran, Filipe Luís, Lucas Hernandez and Rodri, with Antoine Griezmann also expected to depart after £113m signing Joao Felix took the No 7 shirt.
Saul, 24, signed a stunning nine-year contract in July 2017, pinning him to the club until 2026.
