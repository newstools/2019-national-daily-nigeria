A High Court in Kaduna at the resumed sitting on Monday shifted judgment on application for overseas medical trip by the leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), Sheikh Ibrahim El Zakzaky, to August 5.
The court had last week adjourned sitting to Monday for judgment on the suit.
However, El Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, were not in court this Monday. Their lead counsel, Femi Falana, informed the court that their absence was due to poor health conditions.
The suit between the Kaduna State Government and the leader of the Shi’ite Muslims, Ibrahim El Zakzaky, has bee4n generating tension in the state, which further snowballed into violent protests in Abuja, gradually, extending to other parts of the country.
The Kaduna State Government had in the early hours of Monday   put up arrangements for pro-active security checks to forestall breakdown of law and order as the court resumed sitting this Monday.
