Liverpool legend Steve Nicol has urged his former club to re-sign Philippe Coutinho from Barcelona.
Liverpool sold Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona in January 2018 for a fee of £142.5million but the Brazilian has struggled at the Nou Camp and has received criticism from supporters for his performances.
Barca may be keen to sell Coutinho to help fund moves for Antoine Griezmann and Neymar.
“You’re always looking for more goalscorers,” Nicol told ESPN FC. “Somebody like a Coutinho I think would be ideal for Liverpool. You’ve got a front three right now in [Roberto] Firmino, [Sadio] Mane and [Mohamed] Salah who are fantastic.
“But they need a break, they need to be able to step off the field to keep themselves fresh for the challenge ahead.
“Now, I threw in Coutinho’s name there, the problem is could they afford him? Would they pay £100m for him?
“But I’ll tell you what, if they did, what an option that would be. I don’t believe he’s worth what Barcelona paid for him. I certainly believe he’s worth upwards of £90m.
“This is a guy who’s proven in the Premier League. This is a guy, right now, who’s being criticised but this guy who’s been criticised carries the hopes of Brazil in the Copa America right now.
“He’s the go-to guy for creation and for goals. So, when you buy Coutinho yes you’re buying a guy who’s been criticised at Barcelona recently, but you’re buying quality.
“Of course Liverpool need to strengthen, they need strength in depth and when I say depth, they need real quality. That’s what Coutinho would give them.”
