President Muhammadu Buhari has reappointed his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari and Boss Mustapha as Secretary to the Government of the Federation.
This was disclosed on Friday by the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu.
He said both appointments were effective from May 29, 2019.
There have been protests from within the first family how a cabal has been holding back Buhari’s performance.
First lady Aisha made a point of this many times during her husband first-term.
Many believe Kyari and Mamman Daura, Buhari’s cousin, are strong pillars of the Aso Rock cabal.
Series of protests ad counter-protests took place before the latest appointment.
