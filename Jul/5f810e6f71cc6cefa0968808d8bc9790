The Management of Bayelsa Queens FC have responded to the circular released by the Nigeria Women Football League that the postponement of the kick off scheduled for Wednesday 17th July was due to non compliance with registration of some team amongst them Bayelsa Queens, National Daily learnt.

Â  The Chairman of Bayelsa Queens Ebiki Timitimi in a statement issued said that the team is too big not to comply with registration modalities for a league they won last season.

The issue of non compliance is in relation with the cost of cautions for the 2017/18 season which Bayelsa Queens FC management requested for the breakdown of the #230,000 said to be debt of Bayelsa Queens since March 2019.

The Management of Bayelsa Queens still went ahead to pay the sum of #200,000 on the 29th of April,2019 even without proper breakdown from the Women League Board.
It was yesterday 15th of July a breakdown of 30,000 was sent to the club and immediately the money was paid to the women league board, so it was not the fault of Bayelsa Queens .
