Barcelona had planned to pay Antoine Griezmann’s release clause with the league over the next two days, while the French forward remains on holiday despite Atletico Madrid’s demand for him to return to training last week.

The Spanish champions will pay Griezmann’s release clause with the league, but it will be done differently: the player himself will deposit the money with La Liga.

That is the reason for the delay. Barça were weighing up the most appropriate option for Griezmann to pay his clause without being hit fiscally.

Logically, the French forward is the first person interested in not suffering at the hands of the tax office in the case that he has to personally pay the 120 million. Barça are also studying the most adequate way to comply with all the fiscal requirements (especially regarding the IVA payment) so that neither the club nor the player are damaged by the operation.

It’s a complicated operation and a costly one. Barça are making sure they take their time with each step. Meanwhile, there are two key dates to be considered.

Firstly, Ernesto Valverde has called his players back in for preseason on Sunday, July 14.

Secondly, Friday, July 12 is when Griezmann’s holiday ends, as he interprets the 30-day off rule. He is currently in Ibiza. Atletico called him back in on Sunday but the player believed he still had four more days due because of his involvement with France last month.
