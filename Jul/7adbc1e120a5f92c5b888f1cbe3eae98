The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the weekend berated Senate President Ahmad Lawan for his interference with the challenge of Senator Dino Melaye to Festus Keyamo to recite the national anthem during Senate’s ministerial screening on Friday. The PDP described Lawan as rubber stamp Senate President. The party noted that in the era of the PDP government, ministerial nominees who failed to recite the national anthem were not screened, adding that the case is different with the APC rubber stamped senate president.
“In the good old days when the Senate was not a rubber stamped Senate, ministerial nominees were not screened for their inabilities to recite Nigeria National Anthem but this is not so with Buhari rubber stamped Senate President,” PDP declared.
Senator Dino Melaye, representing Kogi West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, challenged Keyamo during the ministerial screening last Friday to prove his mobile intelligence and recite the national anthem. “I know you to be intellectually mobile, I want you to recite the national anthem,” Melaye had challenged Keyamo.
Noticing how the Melaye challenge destabilized Keyamo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan interjected and nullified the Melaye patriotism test, saying it is not a question.
The PDP was of the view that the ruling APC is far behind the PDP in handling governance.
