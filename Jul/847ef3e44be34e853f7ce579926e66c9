The Comptroller General of Customs, retired Colonel Hammed Ali, has denied reports of an attempted coup to overthrow him at the Customs Headquarters, Abuja, on Monday by an Assistant Superintendent of Customs.
An Assistant Superintendent of Customs, Nura Dalhatu, was alleged to have promoted himself to Customs GC and reported at the headquarters to take over from the Comptroller General, Col. Hameed Ali, but was picked up by the Service.
The Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian Customs, DC Joseph Attah, in a statement on Monday accessed by National Daily, refuted the report. He, however, admitted the presence of the officer in senior rank uniform.
The statement reads: “Today, an assistant superintendent of Customs came to the Nigeria Customs Service Headquarters wearing the rank of a Deputy Comptroller General of Customs.
“From questions and answers that followed, it was obvious that he was not in the right frame of mind, so a Doctor was immediately invited.
“He is presently undergoing medical examination at the medical unit of the service.
“His picture is unfortunately going viral in the social media with a wrong narrative that he came to take over office from the CGC.
“This is not correct as it is just a pure medical case.”
