The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Monday said it is not calling any witness in defence of the petition by the Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) and Atiku Abubakar.

Its lawyer, Yunus Usman (SAN) announced this at the resumption of proceedings at the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC).
By the court’s schedule, INEC was expected to open its defence today, but when the case was called, Usman said they have scrutinized the evidence by witnesses called by the petitioners and found that there was no need for INEC to call witnesses.
