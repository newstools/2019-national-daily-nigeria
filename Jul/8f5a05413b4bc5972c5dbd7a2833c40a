Eight persons were injured in an accident on the Enugu-Onitsha expressway, Awka, Anambra State, at the weekend.
The accident involved two Toyota Hiace buses which had an head-on collision by the two commercial vehicles.
Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Andrew Kumapayi said 29 persons – 13 males and 16 females – were involved in the accident. Nobody died in the crash.

He said: “There was a crash involving two vehicles at Amawbia, opposite NIPCO filling station this afternoon. Twenty-nine persons were involved, but eight persons, four males and four females, sustained injuries. The injured have been rushed to the hospital and obstructions cleared by FRSC rescue team who arrived accident scene early.”
Kumapayi, who attributed the crash to route violation, warned motorists to desist from driving against traffic on dual carriage roads.
“Route violation remains a traffic offence and culprits would be arrested and punished accordingly,” he warned.
