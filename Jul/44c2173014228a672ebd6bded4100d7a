Belgian side Anderlecht have confirmed the signing of former Arsenal, Manchester City and France midfielder Samir Nasri, reuniting him with his former City team-mate Vincent Kompany.
The 32-year-old hasn’t played since leaving West Ham at the end of last season, six months after signing a short-term deal with the Hammers in January.
He arrived at the London Stadium just as he completed an 18-month ban from football for doping offences, having tested positive for a banned substance in 2016 that he claimed had administered unknowingly.

And in a bizarre animated short which boasts that Nasri is “quicker than a horse”, the 34-time Belgian champions confirmed via their Twitter account that the former France international has joined them, linking up once again with his former skipper at City.
Kompany left the Premier League champions at the end of this past season having scored the most important goal of the team’s run-in, a 30-yard bullet to earn Pep Guardiola’s side a 1-0 win against Leicester City in their penultimate game.
