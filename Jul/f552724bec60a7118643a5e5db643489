The Germany midfielder has been linked with a move to Turkey, but Fener say they have ‘no intention’ of signing him. “Fenerbahce have no intention of transferring in Mesut Ozil,” a statement on the Super Lig club’s website read. “The transfer is not possible for either the club or Mesut Ozil under the current economic conditions.” Arsenal have made Ozil available for transfer this summer, according to reports.
According to The Telegraph, Derby County, West Bromwich Albion, Middlesbrough and Brentford are among the teams who are keen on signing the 21 year-old, who can play in central midfield or defence. Bielik starred on loan at Charlton Athletic last season, playing a key role as the Addicks clinched promotion in League One through the play-offs.

Arsenal boss Unai Emery, however, does not do not believe Bielik is ready for first-team action this season and he could go out on loan again or on a permanent basis if shows no interest in extending his contract. There is also reported interest in Bielik from Italian giants AC Milan and clubs in the Bundesliga.
