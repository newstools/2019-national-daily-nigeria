The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Saturday charged President Muhammadu Buhari to consider a National Dialogue Forum as a solution to the looming insecurity crisis in the country.

A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase revealed that the governor spoke when he received the President of Evangelical Church Winning All, ECWA, Reverend Stephen Panya Baba, at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi.

The statement reads, “The Governor urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call for a National Dialogue Forum where Nigerians would frankly speak on issues affecting the country, particularly insecurity and proffer solutions.

“As an interim measure to end the wave of threats and counter threats from different sections of the country, Governor Ortom recommended that security operatives should not ignore those beating drums of war.”

Akase maintained that Governor Ortom further condemned the latest order the Fulani herders association, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has given to its members to defend themselves, describing the order as capable of causing unimaginable violence.

“The Governor wondered why the group continuously makes inflammatory statements but its officials are not invited for questioning,” the statement added.

Governor Ortom, who pitched his tent with former President Olusegun Obasanjo on his letter to Buhari, however, called for national prayers for peace in all parts of the country, expressing the hope that the current security challenges would soon be overcome.

On his part, Reverend Panya Baba commended Governor Ortom who he said stood firmly with his people despite the security and political storm, saying it was an indication that the Governor is a leader who truly loves his people.

Recall that Obasanjo in his latest letter to Buhari had said: “Government should open up discussion, debate and dialogue as part of consultation at different levels and the outcome of such deliberations should be collated to form inputs into a national conference to come up with the solution that will effectively deal with the issues and lead to rapid development, growth and progress which will give us a wholesome society and enhanced living standard and livelihood in an inclusive and shared society.”
