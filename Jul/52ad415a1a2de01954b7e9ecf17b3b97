State lawmakers meet with Senate ad-hoc committee

Several members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and some other indigenes of the state, on Thursday took to the streets of Benin City protesting the directive by the House of Representatives, Abuja, on Wednesday to the Inspector General of Police and the Director of the Department of Security Service (DSS) to shut down the Edo State House of Assembly with immediate effect. The federal lawmakers had issued the directive in response to the intractable conflicts ravaging the state Assembly spring from the power tussle between Governor Godwin Obaseki and APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.
The constitution empowers the House of Representatives to oversee the House of Assembly of the 36 states of the federation. The House of Representatives has the constitutional powers to take over the duties of any House of Assembly that is involved in monumental conflicts that threatens democracy or the maintenance of law and order in the state.
Meanwhile, members of the Edo State House of Assembly are having a closed door meeting with the Senate adhoc committee set up to investigate the crisis in the State Assembly.
National Daily learned that the lawmakers have demanded Governor Obaseki to within one week issue a fresh proclamation for the inauguration of the Edo State House of Assembly.
