Fire on Sunday gutted a part of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) station on Sapele road, Benin City, forcing some parts of the city into darkness.
Some areas in Benin City and environs, used to having nine hours electricity daily, have not had power supply after the fire.
The cause of the fire could not be ascertained as at last night, but it was gathered that the fire started from a transformer
Officials of the Edo State Fire Service and other fire service stations battled to quell the fire.
Spokesman for Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) Tayo Adekunle could not be reached for comments but a worker, who pleaded for anonymity, said all areas connected to the Benin TCN were affected due to a partial system collapse. According to him, the TCN sub-station is interconnected to other TCN locations across the country.
The specific locations affected by the fire are still unknown, but major parts of Edo State would be affected by the outage, he added.
