On this day (July 6) in 2009, Cristiano Ronaldo’s presentation at Real Madrid set a benchmark for future transfers.
Starting with his presentation more than 80,000 fans attended it at the Santiago Bernabeu breaking the record of the most attendance for a new signing.
No one could surpass this record until now.
Ronaldo’s 9 years at Real Madrid was insane when you think about it, right from his “low-key” presentation. 451 goals in 438 games, 4 Champions Leagues, 4 Ballon d’Ors.
