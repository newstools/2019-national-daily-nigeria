Lionel Messi was blasted for being disrespectful by Brazil manager Tite after the Barcelona star complained of a conspiracy at the Copa America.

In an extraordinary outburst following his red card in the 2-1 victory over Chile, Messi claimed ’the whole thing was set up for Brazil’ to win the tournament.

Tite has since taken issue with his statement and told the five-time Ballon d’Or winner to show some grace in defeat.

“The one I treated as extraordinary, as extraterrestrial, needs to have more respect and accept when he is beaten,” he said.

“We were harmed [by referees] in several games. We played fair against Argentina the whole time. I am being honest. He put huge pressure [on] because of his reputation.”
