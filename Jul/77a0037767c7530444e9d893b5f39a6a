The seat of power, Aso Rock Presidential Villa has become engulfed in tension of the threat of revenge of the murder of Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Reuben Fasoranti, leader of Afenifere in southwest Nigeria, who was shot dead last Friday along Kajola-Ore Road, Ondo State, presidency source told National Daily. The source said that the presidency is worried over the magnitude and consequences of any outbreak of violence from the southwest.
The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yoruba land, Gani Adams, had at the weekend described the murder of Funke as “one killing too many”, vowing that the Yoruba ethnic nationality will respond to the killing. National Daily learned that Iba Adams had cautioned that they should not be blamed when that happens.
Adams in a statement by his media assistant, Kehinde Aderemi, accessed byNational Daily,affirmed that the Yoruba are not at a loss on what to do to end the “atrocities of Fulani herdsmen”, but had continuously issued statements to call the attention of the world to the development.
He had declared: “We only want the whole world to know what has been done and being done to our people.
“They should be aware of the actions that preceded our reaction when it eventually comes.
“We are not bereft of ideas of how to stop this criminality on our land.
“It is just so that we should not be blamed when the reaction comes.
“We are like the proverbial goat that is being chased.
“When it gets to the wall, it will certainly react. We are at that stage now.”
Iba Adams had indicated that the Yoruba had been meeting over a period of three weeks on the security threat to its people, urging the six southwest governors to speed up the conclusion of their security summit.
He commiserated with elder Fasoranti, assuring him that justice must prevail. “Papa, this is a very trying time, but it is certain justice will come,” Iba Adams stated.
