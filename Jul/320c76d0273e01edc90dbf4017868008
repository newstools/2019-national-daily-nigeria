Manchester United have been handed a double boost in their transfer pursuit of Nicolas Pepe.

The Lille striker is a Red Devils target, but is also strongly linked with a move to Napoli.

Napoli manager Carlo Ancelotti confirmed Pepe’s agent Samir Khiat was at the Italian club’s team hotel to thrash out deal for his client, seeing them steal a march on United.

“I’ve met with Pepe’s agents,” confirmed Ancelotti. “They were at our hotel.

“It is normal that we would meet to discuss eventual negotiations. It is pointless to hide it with his agents here: we are interested in Pepe.

“Pepe is a wide attacking player. We want to find someone who can play between the lines, without forgetting that Milik is a centre-forward, but also strong with his feet.”

But fresh reports suggest Napoli’s deal for Pepe isn’t a foregone conclusion.
