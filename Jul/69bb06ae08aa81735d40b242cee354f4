The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has accused the Federal Government of secretly planning to execute the Ruga settlement for herdsmen across the country despite the announcement that the idea has been suspended.

CAN which ventilated its plight in a statement by its Secretary representing the 17 southern states, Dr. Joseph Ajujungwa, also urged people of southern Nigeria to remain cautious even with the suspension of the controversial RUGA settlement for herdsmen.

The Christian group also queried the Federal Government to explain why it has given such an attention to the cattle rearers at the expense of other farmers in the country.

It said that the suspension of the programme by President Muhammadu Buhari may not be the end of the matter, adding that it suspected that underground work was still going on over the RUGA Project.

Ajujungwa in the statement, however, called on every southerner to be watchful, stressing that even as the churches pray, they don’t need to keep quiet on such matters.

His words: “We do not have land to give to anybody as a grazing field or colony and we call on the South-East governors to maintain their stand that they do not have such a place.

“Do you know what it means to give 10 hectares of land to herdsmen? We say no to that. “As CAN, we will preach it from our pulpit.

“Every Imam should preach from the mosque and the traditionalists should stand against it; nobody should relent; no land should be given. Any traditional ruler that does that should be dethroned.”
