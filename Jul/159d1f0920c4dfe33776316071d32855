Premier League winner Micah Richards has officially retired from professional football, and is set to return to Manchester City in an ‘ad hoc off-the-field role.
 
The defender has hung up his boots at the age of just 31 after losing his battle with a long-term knee injury.
 
Richards spent the majority of his career with City, where he came through their academy and ended up lifting the Premier League title and FA Cup.
 
He spent one year on loan at Fiorentina before joining Aston Villa on a free transfer in 2015, where he spent four injury-hampered seasons before he was released at the end of the 2018/19 campaign.
