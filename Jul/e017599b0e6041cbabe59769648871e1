Intending Hajj pilgrims have been warned against trafficking illegal and contraband drugs, such as cocaine, Tramadol, heroin and cannabis to Saudi Arabia.

The NDLEA official said: “The lives of indicted pilgrims will not only be terminated, but such acts will also strain Saudi/Nigerian ties and of course, damage the good reputation of Hajj Mabrur as one of the trusted Hajj and Umrah operators, as well as Nigerians…”
The seminar, held at the Islamic Centre at the University of Lagos Central Mosque in Lagos, had in attendance personnel from Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), lawyers, members and executives of The Muslim Congress (TMC) and spiritual leaders, among others.

TMC’s Naibul Amir, Cultural Affairs Ustadh Sheriffdeen Ibrahim noted that Hajj was a spiritual journey requiring preparation.
“One of the benefits ofHajj is to purify your soul. We must get prepared in terms of knowledge by reading books on Hajj, gathering money and arranging for food, which should not be in excess.
“Psychological preparation is also important. The mind must be ready for the various rites and obligations so as to maximise all rewards inherent in Hajj.
‘’Time management is also important. Know what to do, when to do and why doing them. This would aid us in having a Hajj Mabrur,” he said.
