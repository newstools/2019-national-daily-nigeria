Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce has sounded yet another warning to Manchester United over Sean Longstaff. The Red Devils have been monitoring the midfielder for a while, but the newly instated Magpies manager says “he’s not for sale.”
“You never want to lose your best young players, and I think we’ve made it pretty evident that we won’t,” Bruce said.
in other news, Newcastle want €15m-rated PSG defender. Newcastle United are interested in signing Stanley N’Soki from Paris Saint-Germain, but have not managed to convince the Ligue 1 side with their opening bid, reports Le Parisien.
The Magpies have reportedly made an offer of €8 million (£7m/$9m) for N’Soki, but that falls somewhat short of PSG’s valuation, which currently stands at €15m (£13.5m/$17m).
Serie A sides Lazio and Roma are also said to be interested, with the former making an offer to loan the defender.
