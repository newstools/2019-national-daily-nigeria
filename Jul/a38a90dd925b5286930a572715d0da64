Prof. Ben Nwabueze (SAN) appeared Thursday morning as the lead counsel for the Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, as they set to call their witnesses at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal in Abuja.
The Justice Mohammed Garba-led tribunal began sitting about 10.40am, and Nwabueze earlier wheeled into the courtroom appealed to the court for permission to be seated while addressing the bench.
His request was granted, and  feebly began announcing the names of other lawyers appearing with him.


The octogenarian had to hand over the role to Dr. Livy Uzoukwu (SAN), who had from the beginning, been leading the petitioners’ team.
For the defendants,  Yunus Usman (SAN) announced appearance as the lead counsel for the Independent National Electoral Commission; Mike Igbokwe (SAN) for President Muhammadu Buhari, and Yakubu Maikyau (SAN), for the APC.
After the bar closed the announcement of the appearance, Nwabueze expressed “gratitude” to the tribunal “for granting me my first request”.
In his “short remark” which he sought to be allowed to deliver, Nwabueze said, “The determination of the petition will certainly impact on future elections and constitutionalism in the country.”
According to him,  notwithstanding his age and attendant health challenges, he  attended the proceedings “to underscore the importance” of the case.
He then took permission to leave the courtroom, and he was wheeled out of the courtroom.
Meanwhile, Uzoukwu who took over the leadership of the petitioners’ legal team announced that they would be starting the case with Niger State.
No fewer than 50 boxes containing electoral materials from Niger, Jigawa, Kebbi, and Yobe states, have been brought into the court.
