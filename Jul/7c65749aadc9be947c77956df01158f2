European football expert Mark Langdon has been discussing Malcom’s future at Barcelona, with Arsenal keen on the Brazil forward.

The Gunners reportedly want to sign Malcom on loan this summer with an option to buy him outright at the end of the season, though Barca would prefer a permanent sale now

Langdon told talkSPORT: “Malcom is someone who has failed to deliver at Barcelona. He would say he doesn’t get many opportunities, while Barcelona would say that when he has been given the chance he hasn’t overly looked like a Barcelona player.

“They probably shouldn’t have bought him in the first place. He was on his way to Roma and was snatched by Barca with his mum already on the way to Roma airport to meet Malcom – but he ended up in Barcelona instead.

“I think Malcom is available, but it will be a congested list of teams after him.”
