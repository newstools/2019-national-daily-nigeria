Two former governors of Anambra State, former Governor Chris Ngige, and former Governor Peter Obi, at the sitting of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal on Friday turned the break session of the proceedings to party time to mark the 58th birth anniversary of Obi, Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections.
National Daily learned that Dr. Chris Ngige electrified the tribunal with humour in his jokes all over the court, telling Peter Obi that he will tell the Judges presiding in the suits to give him whatever he wants as birthday present.
“Onwa has truly energized the court with so much humour while we all wait for the judges to come back…,” Obi had acknowledged.
Meanwhile, the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja, on Friday congratulated Obi on his 58thbirthday. The party in a tweet,#PeterObiAt58, wrote: “Hurray! The Vice Presidential Candidate of the PDP and former Governor of Anambra State, H.E. @PeterObi is 58 years today.
“We wish him many more years of service to our nation Nigeria and pray for God’s abundant blessings upon his life.
“Once more, Happy birthday, Your Excellency.”
