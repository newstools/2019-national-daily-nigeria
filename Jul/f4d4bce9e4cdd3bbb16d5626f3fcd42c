A lecturer in the Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies, Kogi State University, Anyigba, died of High Blood Pressure (HBP) while waiting in hospital for test result.
Family sources said Dr Jamiu Abdullahi could not buy the drug prescribed to treat himself of the ailment that took his life because his salaries were being held for several months by the Kogi State Government.
Other lecturers in the university collected their salaries in February.
His corpse was taken to his country home in Iyamoye in Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State and has since been buried according to Islamic rites.
The Kogi State University Public Relations Officer, Mr Jacob Edegbo confirmed the death of the lecturer.
He, however, said his death has nothing to do with unpaid salaries.
According to him, the late lecturer has been sick for some time. When he went to the hospital for check-up, before the result came out, he gave up the ghost.
