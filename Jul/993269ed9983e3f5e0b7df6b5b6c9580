Antoine Griezmann is set to be fined for refusing to attend pre-season training on Sunday, according to ESPN FC. The Frenchman is expected to join Barcelona in a deal worth £107million – but the Catalan giants still haven’t made an official offer.

Atletico Madrid publicly called on Griezmann to join up with his team-mates on Sunday but the 28-year-old didn’t attend. ESPN FC now claim Atletico have opened disciplinary proceedings against Griezmann, who could be subject to a £190k fine.

Paris Saint-Germain have released an official statement reprimanding Brazilian superstar Neymar. The 27-year-old was supposed to report for pre-season training today with the Ligue 1 champions but failed to show ‘at the agreed time and place’.

A PSG statement read: “This Monday, July 8, Neymar da Silva Santos Junior was summoned for the resumption of activities of the professional group of Paris Saint-Germain.

“Paris Saint-Germain found that the player Neymar Jr did not show up at the agreed time and place, without having been authorised by the Club in advance.

“Paris Saint-Germain deplores this situation and will take the appropriate measures resulting from it.”

Neymar’s absence is likely due to Brazil’s Copa America victory and further fuels speculation of the forward re-joining Barcelona in a mega-money move.
