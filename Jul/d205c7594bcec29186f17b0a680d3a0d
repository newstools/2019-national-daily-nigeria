According to Akiolu, Tinubu knew full well that he is not a rubber stamp to him, saying that the former governor of Lagos State did not always reject his advice and requests.

Akiolu said Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat should not grant his request if he made unworthy demands from them.
