National Chairperson of Nigeria Eagles Supporters Club Kemi Ogunfuwa has described the experience in Egypt as worthwhile, fruithful and results oriented adventure which culminated into the bronze medal for Nigeria Super Eagles

The national media officer of the group, Sunday Agunbiad told National Daily that the Lagos based football enthusiast said her group travelled from Nigeria to cheer Super Eagles to victory even though not without a slight delay from Egyptian embassy which I would not like to put in print” . We were later swelled up with our registered members based in Egypt and other neighbouring African countries who always join us in every part of the world”


Ogunfuwa said, “We experienced little hiccups from Egyptian Embassy where some members were denied visas but as a leader, I waited behind to stay with my members to ensure that they all got their visas before we took off. I think the issue of delay cuts across and just like I said I don’t want to say more on this because I have a good relationship with them as I speak.”

She added  that a lot of our members would enjoy a good jolly ride traveling arrangements in our subsequent matches as  executives have learnt a great deal of lesson from the experience and we shall always improve on the previous” .

 “These players worth celebrating considering the fact that they do give their all to the nation. I think they deserve our pat and encouragements even though there are bounds to be mistakes on the field of play”
