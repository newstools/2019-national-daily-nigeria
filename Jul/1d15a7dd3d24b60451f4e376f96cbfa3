Juventus have secured the signing of Adrien Rabiot.
The 24-year-old completed his medical in Turin earlier today and has put pen to paper on a contract with the Serie A champions.
Juve didn’t disclose the details of the transfer – although it’s thought the French midfielder signed a five-year-deal worth £6.2million per-year.
Rabiot had been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Barcelona.
