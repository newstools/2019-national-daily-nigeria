Barcelona star Lionel Messi is still looking for his first major international title with Argentina.
His nation face Brazil tonight in the Copa America semi-final but Messi admits the tournament has been a struggle.
“The truth is I’m not having my best Copa America,” said Messi.
“It’s always very difficult for us because we want to do something different and attack and teams pack out the middle of the pitch.”
In other news, Lionel Messi contract negotiations with Barcelona may be troubled if they fail to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain, according to La Liga expert Graham Hunter.
Messi wants Barcelona to sign Neymar this summer, with the Brazil international eager to leave PSG behind.
But Hunter believes the club risk losing their star asset if they fail to agree to his demands.
“Let’s not ignore the dilemma of club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, either, after he explicitly stated that one of his legacies, before his mandate ends in 2021, should be renewing Messi’s contract once again,” Hunter wrote for ESPN India.
“If, as I believe, Messi has made it clear to Bartomeu that he must try to bring Neymar ‘home’ then how does the president slap that request down, or ignore it, but then start what he hopes will be fruitful, effective negotiations with team Messi?”
