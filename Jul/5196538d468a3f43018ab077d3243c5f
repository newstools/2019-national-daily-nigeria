Manchester United will look to sign former Celtic and Fulham striker Moussa Dembele if Romelu Lukaku leaves for Inter Milan.
 
United are willing to sell Lukaku but rejected a bid of £54m from Inter last week, with the Premier League club valuing him at more than £79m.
 
But the Italian side could still complete the move and, with only two weeks of the English window remaining, United are already planning for his departure.
 
And, according to Sky Sports News, Dembele – now at Lyon – is on the Red Devils’ shortlist as they prepare for Lukaku’s possible exit.
 
In other news, Interested clubs will now have to pay a lot more to sign Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld, after a clause in his contract expired on Thursday night.
 
The Belgian centre-back could have been landed for a cut-price £25m due to a detail in his Spurs deal, but that expired yesterday with no clubs triggering it.
 
It now means the 30-year-old’s value has increased to closer to £40m, claim The Sun.
 
Alderweireld was widely tipped to leave Tottenham this summer, with Manchester United a long-term target, but the defender hinted earlier in the window he could remain at White Hart Lane.
 
Asked if he expects to be at Spurs for the start of the new campaign, Alderweireld replied: “Yes, that’s my focus. The manager knows I am committed to the club and the team but you never know in football.
 
“My focus is on Spurs and I try to deliver the job I need to do – I’m happy and that’s it. In my head I will be playing for Spurs.”
