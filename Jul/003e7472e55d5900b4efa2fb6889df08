13-year old pupil, Egbadon Overcome, has been killed by flood while going to school.
The late Overcome was a Primary 3 pupil of Idumu Ague Primary School in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State.
Eyewitnesses said the flood water must have been diverted to the area due to the construction of the new Agbor road. The body was removed by officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC).
Chairman of the Edo State Universal Basic Education Board Dr. Joan Oviaw said  field officers have been deployed to unravel the cause of the death.
Dr. Oviawe, who described the death as unfortunate, said the government would unravel the circumstances which led to Overcome’s death and prevent a recurrence.
She said: “The Edo State Universal Basic Education Board regrets to announce the unfortunate death of Egbadon Overcome, a 13-year-old primary 3 pupil of Idumu Ague Primary School, in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area. The Board has sent field officers to gather information on what transpired and the circumstances that led to the death of the pupil.
“We commiserate with the child’s parents, the management of Idumu Ague Primary School and the community. We will investigate the death and work towards preventing a recurrence.”
