Frank Lampard was pleased with Chelsea’s performance despite a 1-1 draw against Bohemians in his first game in charge recently, National Daily learnt.

The Premier League side took an early lead through Michy Batshuayi, but Eric Molloy scored an 89th-minute equaliser for Bohemians in Dublin.

Despite the result, Lampard â€“ in his first game as head coach of Chelsea â€“ was satisfied with his side.

“It was a tough game for us. We haven’t been back for long and this was our first game after just a few days so there was a bit of pressure on the lads to work today,” he told Chelsea TV.

“We’ve been working them very hard and we did the same this morning as well. I want to stretch them because that’s what pre-season is all about.

“We wanted to win obviously because you always do but it’s not about that at this point â€“ it’s about individuals getting fit and pushing themselves to the limit.
