Rio Ferdinand doesn’t think Manchester United should allow Mason Greenwood to leave the club on loan next season.

The 17-year-old has scored two goals in three appearances during United’s pre-season tour of Australia and Southeast Asia, including Saturday’s winner against Inter Milan.

His performance off the bench against the Nerazzurri led to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer comparing his career trajectory to that of Ryan Giggs.

Solskjaer himself has said he doesn’t envisage Greenwood leaving the club on loan and Ferdinand agrees with United’s manager that the teenager is ready for more opportunities next season.

In other news, Nicolas Pepe’s future is almost decided, Lille’s president has confirmed.

It was reported by The Sunday Times over the weekend that United are pushing to sign the Ivory Coast international.

And Lille president Gerard Lopez has now confirmed he is close to leaving the club

“For Nico, it is almost done and he could have left last summer,” Lopez said.

“It is true that there are big offers and big clubs in for him, so I think [he will leave].”
