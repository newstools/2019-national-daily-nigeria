The Forum of APC Chairmen, a coterie of party’s paperweights that fear being left o the shelf till 2023, has joined the long list of fora in Nigeria’s political arena, but unfortunately its effort to get a job at the Senate fell flat out Monday.
Sen. President Ahmed Lawan was done with the appointment of his staff and aides weeks ago.
So refused to accept the chairmen’s offer to become his mediator and issue manager when, they hope, he has crisis either with his colleagues or the executive.
According to Lawan, when he and others campaigned for elections into the offices of the President of the Senate and Deputy President of the Senate, the party must have seen how loyal and committed senators were.
“This was clearly different from what happened in 2015,” he noted.
“Therefore, Mr Chairman of chairmen,” said Lawan to Abba Dalori who led the opportunists to the Sentae, “I don’t think I will ever invite you to come and intervene on my behalf when I will have any issue with any senator.”
The No 3 citizen said he owes his colleagues a lot.
“Should I disagree with someone, the matter would be resolved among us. The Executive and the Legislature in this respect with the dominance of the APC in the Senate and the APC administration, we have one course, one focus and one direction.”
