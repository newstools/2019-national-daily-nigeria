The controversy over the RUGA settlement policy of President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to generate inter-ethnic tension and latent hostilities across Nigeria. Ironically, the controversies have begun to go beyond the bounds of public policy analysis to frontal attacks on the primordial values of leaders in the country. Accordingly, a former minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has taken President Muhammadu Buhari to the sublime, challenging the president to be prepared to exchange cattle rearing in the south with pig rearing in the north.
Fani-Kayode in a tweet on Wednesday stated that if the president insists on RUGA, then, he will be sent PUGA in exchange for the animal husbandry business.
Femi Fani-Kayode on his official twitter handle, @realFFK, posted: “If you insist on sending your cow-loving terrorist herdsmen to the south with their accursed charmed cows in the name of RUGA, we shall insist on sending millions of pig-loving militants and maggot-infested plagued pigs to the North. You do me, I do you! You RUGA me, I PUGA you.”
