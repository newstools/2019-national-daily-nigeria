The Ondo State House of Assembly was disrupted Thursday by snakes as a plenary session was underway.
The serpentine visitors descended from the roof of the chamber Wednesday and Thursday.
One that fell during the Thursday sitting nearly landed on the Speaker Bamidele Oloyeloogun while presiding over the session.
The Assembly had to adjourn its sittingÂ until certain repairs were carried out on the Assembly complex.
