The Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, said on Monday that the Tier II N30 billion subordinated unsecured bond  issued by the bank to strengthen its funding base was oversubscribed.

Wigwe said: “We are a bank with a rigorous and disciplined capital plan and the action taken today is in line with our five -year strategic plan.
 
“This is to ensure a strong capital buffer at all times and support our low-risk appetite. Following the merger, we identified some synergies and combined with this issue, we are confident of our capacity to attain the next level of being a more efficient bank.”
 
The issuing houses are Chapel Hill Denham Advisory Limited, Lead Issuing House, Coronation Merchant Bank Limited and First-Ally Capital Limited.

A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. A bond has an end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually includes the terms for variable or fixed interest payments that will be made by the borrower.
 
Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debt-holders or creditors of the issuer.
