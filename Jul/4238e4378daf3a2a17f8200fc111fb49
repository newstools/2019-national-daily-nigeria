Joao Felix has been officially unveiled as an Atletico Madrid player. The Portuguese talent, who was signed for an astonishing £114million, was presented at the Wanda Metropolitano on Monday.
Felix scored 20 goals and contributed 11 assists in 43 games for Benfica last season. The 19-year-old has a £225m release clause in his contract and is set to earn £15million across the next five seasons. He has been referred to as the new Ronaldo. But the humble Portugal lad as insisted he doesn’t want an unnecessary comparison with Cristiano Ronaldo. He plans to chart his own course.

Also, in other news, Barcelona have won the battle to sign West Brom teenager Louie Barry. The Sun claim Barry has rejected a contract offer from the Baggies, who will be owed a modest £235,000 in compensation.

Paris Saint-Germain were thought to be leading the hunt for the 16-year-old having undergone a medical with the French side. However, Barcelona’s late swoop appears decisive with Barry happy to accept a smaller wage packet to join the club’s famous La Masia academy for the 2019-20 season.
