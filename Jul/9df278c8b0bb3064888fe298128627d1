Juventus are reportedly willing to sell Paulo Dybala this summer and will let the Argentine join United for between £70million and £90m.

Mail Online say Cristiano Ronaldo is the only player Juve deem indispensable, and that Dybala will be allowed to go if their valuation of the player is met.

It is added that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a huge fan of Dybala and will press for United to sign him if Romelu Lukaku or Paul Pogba leave.


In other news, Manchester United still plan on installing a technical director despite promoting Nicky Butt to the head of first-team development.

Nick Cox has occupied the head of academy role Butt vacated as part of their restructuring but the club’s search for a technical director is still ongoing.

Senior United sources indicated in March they hoped to hire a technical director before the start of the season, but United’s Premier League opener against Chelsea is on August 11 and they have just 16 more days to complete signings in the transfer window.

United want a technical director who is a cultural fit that ‘shares their holistic view’. The MEN understands the inaugural technical director would chair a committee, likely made up of former players, who would recommend transfer targets and take decisions on current players’ futures.
