Freshmen Festus Keyamo and Timi Slva may have a rough ride when it is their turn s nominees for screening by the Senate.
They have corruption questions to answer.
Sen. President Ahmed Lawan has been asking many of the ministerial nominees resident Muhammadu Buhari sent to the Senate to take a bow, and go—no screening because they were ex-lawmakers or former ministers.
But Keyamo and the former governor have corruption questions to answer—the cop and robber kind of question.
Reno Omokri, an ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, has made some claims against the duo.
According to Omokri, Sylva was under investigation for N19 billion fraud. And, as it happened, Keyamo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, investigated him. The case has yet to be concluded.
“Do you know that one of General @MBuhari’s ministerial nominees, Timipre Sylva, was prosecuted by another of General Buhari’s ministerial nominees, Festus @FKeyamo, when Sylva was facing a ₦19 billion fraud case?” he tweeted.
How both men, now minister wannabes, will regard each other in the fight against corruption their boss always trumpets about is now the question.
