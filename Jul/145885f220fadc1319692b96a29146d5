Wolverhampton Wanderers are hopeful of adding two new faces to their squad before their Premier League curtain-raiser with Leicester City, reports the Express & Star.
Milan and Italy striker Patrick Cutrone and Benfica defender Ruben Dias are the players on Wolves’ radar, with talks with the former said to be “at an advanced stage”.
A move for Dias, however, could turn out to be more complicated, with Benfica keen to hang on to the Portugal international. West Ham move to snap up French teen Hassaini. West Ham United have opened talks in an effort to sign out-of-contract teenager Bilel Hassaini, according to Get French Football News.
The French attacking midfielder, 18, is without a club following the expiration of his youth deal with Ligue 2 side AS Nancy last month.
