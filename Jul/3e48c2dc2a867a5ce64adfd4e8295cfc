Chelsea are likely to sell Tiemoue Bakayoko amid interest from Arsenal, talkSPORT has been told.

European football expert Mark Langdon says the Blues could cash in on the midfielder as they are well stocked in the centre of the park. Bakayoko is reportedly being tracked by the Gunners, as well as their Premier League rivals Man United.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if he left Chelsea,” said Langdon. “I don’t think they’ll sell many [with their transfer ban], but there is no point keeping all those midfielders; they are well stocked there with Mateo Kovacic, N’Golo Kante, Jorginho, Ross Barkley, and Ruben Loftus-Cheek to come back from injury.

“If you want to make room for someone like Mason Mount you can’t have too many players in that position, so that might be one they are prepared to do.”
