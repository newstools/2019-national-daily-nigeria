Ryan Kent has deleted all Instagram posts related to Liverpool and unfollowed the team. The 22-year-old had featured regularly for The Reds in pre-season, but now seems headed for the exit at Anfield. Kent spent last season on loan at Rangers and has been linked with a move back north of the border.
Also, Gerrard wants Morelos to answer questions himself. Rangers boss Steven Gerrard is frustrated by repeated questions about the future of striker Alfredo Morelos. The Colombian has been linked with a move away from Ibrox, with a host of clubs including AC Milan and West Ham named as interested in him.
“I’m going to do everything I can to put Alfredo in front of you guys,” Gerrard told a press conference, “then you can ask hin the question whether he wants to be a part of this going forward.”
