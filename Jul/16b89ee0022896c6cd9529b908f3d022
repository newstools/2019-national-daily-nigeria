Paul Pogba appears to have clashed with Jesse Lingard just hours after Manchester United touched down in Australia for pre-season training. In a video shared on the official United Twitter feed, Pogba and the England international seem to get into some sort of dispute.

And that sees Victor Lindelof get involved as he looks to diffuse the situation. Pogba takes a step towards Lingard with the winger looking less than impressed with the World Cup winner.

Everton are set to make an offer of £31million for Barcelona winger Malcom. Arsenal were reportedly lining Malcom up as a cheaper alternative to first-choice target Wilfried Zaha.

But RMC journalist Mohamed Bouhafsi says Marco Silva’s Toffees have made the Brazilian their top priority. He said: “Everton will pass on an offer in excess of €35m for Malcom. Marco Silva has made the former Bordeaux player his priority. Arsenal is on the lookout. The Gunners are in discussions with the player’s entourage but have yet to make an offer.”
