A 65-metre Galactica Star super yacht worth $42m (N15.1bn) belonging to oil magnate Kola Aluko, has been sold by Nigeria and the US.
Aluko , an ally of former oil minister Diezani Allison-Madueke, was accused ripped off almost $1.8bn (N648bn) from Nigeria’s crude oil sales.
He has been on the run since 2015.
The customized yacht, by Dutch yard Heesen in 2013, is the second largest ever built by Heesen, according to Yatch Harbour.
The big boy’s toy, which was sold July25, features exterior styling by Omega Architects, engineering by Van Oossanen & Associates, finished by interiors from the boards of Bannenberg & Rowell.
Galactica Star accommodates up to 12 guests overnight in six cabins, comprising a master suite, one VIP stateroom, and four double cabins.
It is also capable of carrying up to 13 crew members onboard to ensure a relaxed luxury yacht experience.
The yacht was in demand for charter among US celebs, including  Jay Z and Beyonce who hired it for a holiday cruise.
Yatch Harbour report stated that in April , the vessel was offered for sale in a sealed bid arrangement proposed by the US Department of Justice and the Federal Republic of Nigeria and approved by US federal court.
The US government had accused Aluko and another oil businessman, Jide Omokore, of laundering money in the US and using it to acquire the yacht, among other assets.
“The US and Nigerian governments received Federal Court approval to sell the arrested super yacht due to high maintenance and dockage fees, estimating the combined cost at around $170,000 per month. Managed by Fraser, the vessel was listed at $42m,” the report added.
