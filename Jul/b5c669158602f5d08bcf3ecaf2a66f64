Tottenham are reportedly ready to turn to Ajax star David Neres if they fail to land top targets Giovani Lo Celso or Paulo Dybala this summer, according to Calciomercato. The north London club have reportedly been quoted a fee of a £54m (€60m) for the 22-year-old Brazilian winger.
Also, Forest and Birmingham keen on Wolves forward loan. Championship clubs Nottingham Forest and Birmingham City are reportedly in the running to take Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Rafa Mir on loan, according to Nottinghamshire Live. Mir spent the 2018-19 campaign on loan in Spain’s Segunda Division with Las Palmas, and found the net seven times in 30 league appearances.
