The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, on Monday subtly disputed the open letter former President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari on the rising insecurity in the Nigeria and the associated threats to national integration.
National Daily learned that Buratai, visiting troops at 1 Division Super Camp in Kuyello, Birnin Gwari Local Government Area, Kaduna State on Monday, stated that the military has reduced insecurity in the country; affirming that the military recorded “great success” in the fight against insecurity.
However, the statement is widely conceived to be contrary to the realities in the country where versions of violent uprisings have been springing up in the north where one violent group tends to overthrow the other in destruction intensity and capability.
Some stakeholders in the Nigerian polity who spoke to National Daily on the condition of anonymity were opf the view that the Chief of Army Staff lied in the claim that the military have reduced insecurity at a time the situation is getting worse in northwest after the ravages in northeast and north central which have not yet ended.
The Chief of Army Chief was, however, of the view that some Nigerians are playing politics with the security situation in the country, threatening that that the army would not hesitate to take action against them.
National Dailygathered that Buratai had declared:
“Apart from some isolated remote areas as a result of some other factors, the attacks have drastically reduced,
“That means we are winning and it is a great success which people should be assured. All these cries of insecurity which some groups and individuals are taking it as a political game, I think they should have a rethink because it is no longer the case.
“Insecurity has been tamed right now in the northeast and in the northwest and even in other areas, we are doing so well. Our troops are deployed in support of the government, civil police and indeed the civil authorities.”
