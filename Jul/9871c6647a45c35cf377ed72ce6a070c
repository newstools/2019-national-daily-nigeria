Rafinha, the Barcelona midfielder, 26, made just five La Lia appearances last season having suffered a cruciate ligament injury.
But he’s returned to fitness now and feature in Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in Japan.
ESPN FC claim Fiorentina are showing interest in the Brazilian star – whose contract is set to expire in June 2020.
It’s said that with less than 12 months on his contract Barcelona want a paltry £13million for his services.
Also, Barcelona are close to signing Real Betis star Junior Firpo.
The Catalan giants are in the market for versatile left-sided defender to provide cover/competition for 30-year-old Jordi Alba.
And Italian reporter Gianluca Di Marzio claims Firpo is ‘on his way’ to the Nou Camp.
It’s said the two clubs are close to agreeing a £24million deal.
In other news, Atletico Madrid want to block Antoine Griezmann’s registration at Barcelona.
The Spanish champions signed Griezmann, 28, for £107million when his previous £180m release clause dropped on July 1.
“Atletico wrote to us and placed in doubt whether or not we should grant Griezmann’s licence at Barcelona,” La Liga president Tebas told radio station Onda Cero.
“There is a mechanism that has been put in place and it will be the organisations that must resolve the situation. We don’t have the element of judgement.”
