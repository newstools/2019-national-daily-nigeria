Kogi’s former Gov Ibrahim Idris has been accused of seeking a third term by proxy through his son Abubakar who has indicated interest in contesting the forth coming guber election on the platform of the PDP.
Idris accuser is his own son Suleiman, also a PDP member in the Dekina LGA of the state.
Suleiman said his father knows that Abubakar is a no-no when it comes to leadership.
“My father knows Abubakar doesn’t have the capacity to be a class prefect—not to talk of being a governor,” he told a group of delegates.
According to Suleiman, press releases are not enough to promote a candidate, daring his brother to come and address the media.
He boasted he is a kingmaker in Kogi, citing another former Gov. Wada whom he helped into office.
Wada’s brother Musa is also seeking the party’s ticket, and Ibrahim said he is supporting him against his own brother he described as incompetent.
“My father can’t afford to support a candidate like Musa. He needs somebody he can control for his personal gains,” he said.
Musa is also a son-in-law to the Idris.
Suleiman also told the delegates that the Wadas are not exactly the same, so they should not compare the former governor with his brother Musa.
Also contesting the state governorship is PDP’s Sen Dino Melaye, who then will have to do battle with the Wadas and the Idris for the party’s ticket.
