No fewer than 59,306 candidates are expected to sit for the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN) post Universal Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME).
The four-day screening exercise for the 2019/2020 academic session, which commenced on Monday will end on Thursday spokesperson of the institution Kunle Akogun has said.
Speaking on the conduct of the exercise, Akogun said that the exercise commenced on Monday simultaneously at the university main campus and Lagos centre.
He said that the breakdown of the figure showed that 51,868 are UTME candidates while the remaining 7,438 are Direct Entry candidates.
The vice chancellor of the university, Prof Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, had put the carrying capacity of the university for the 2019/2020 admission at about 10,000 students
He said that the screening exercise, which commenced at 7am was very peaceful, adding that the candidates had comported themselves in orderly manner.
However, some parents had complained that requirements to sit for the CBT test should be spelt out to candidates in the future, saying that so many candidates were disturbed when asked to produce certain documents before they could sit for the test.
The people urged the institutionâ€™s management to provide adequate transportation into and outside the university campus, saying that large population of candidates and their guardians had compounded transportation challenge.
