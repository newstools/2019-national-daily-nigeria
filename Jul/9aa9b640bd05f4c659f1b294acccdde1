The Human Rights Committee of the United Nations (UN) has asked the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari critical questions about killing, corruptions, human rights violations, and same-sex marriage in Nigeria.
This was contained in a report released at the conclusion of its review of the implementation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in Nigeria.
The UN body met the Nigerian federal delegation led by the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations Office at Geneva, Amb. Audu Ayinla Kadiri.
Questions were also raised on the killings of members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) known as Shiites.
The Committee Experts, Chaired by Ahmed Amin Fathalla, explained that the purpose of the meeting was to find common ground so that the committee may formulate recommendations aiming to help the government to move forward.
They pointed out that corruption remained rampant and that implementation of the legislation was weak. 
The experts asked if there was a law that prohibited discrimination that would cover direct and intersected forms of discrimination. 
“Was the Government considering repealing article 214 of the criminal code which criminalized sexual acts between persons of the same sex? What measures were in place to address the discriminatory effects of legislation on polygamy and repudiation?” They asked.
Kadiri, in concluding remarks, said that the dialogue had been interesting and illuminating and the delegation had done its best to answer the Experts’ questions. 
“All is well that ends well,” he said, stressing that the delegation and the Committee shared a common purpose. The delegation looked forward to cooperating further with the Committee,’ he sad.
