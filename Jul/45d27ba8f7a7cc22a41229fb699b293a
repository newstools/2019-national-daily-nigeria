The Minority Leader of the ninth House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, and six other lawmakers in the lower chamber of the National Assembly has cautioned the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over their hasty suspension from the party. National Daily learned that the lawmakers further admonished the party leadership to respect the constitution and adhere to due process.
The suspension of the lawmakers is the consequence of their disloyalty to the PDP leadership on the appointment of the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives which Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila approved a member contrary to the PDP recommendation.
The House Minority Leader, Elumelu, had in a statement by the seven suspended lawmakers chided the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) over their suspension.
The lawmakers had argued that they did not ignore the party’s invitation to appear before the NWC but that they received the letter of invitation very late and at a time they were out of Abuja.
Wole Oke was said to have decried that his suspension was unfortunate; noting that PDP leaders have suspended the most loyal member. He counseled the party leaders to adhere to the Constitution.
Other members who include Lynda Ikpeazu from Anambra State, Anayo Edwin from Ebonyi State, Gideon Gwani from Kaduna State, Toby Okechukwu from Enugu State and Serious Abdulmajid from Ogun State were parties to the protest statement at the weekend.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, had announced the suspension of the lawmakers at media briefing in Abuja on Friday.
