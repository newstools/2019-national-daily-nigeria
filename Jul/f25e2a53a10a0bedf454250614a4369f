A group in the social mobilization structure of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) directly under the aegis of the presidential movement at the weekend ridiculed the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari to find solutions to the rising insecurity in Nigeria. The group took up one page of a daily newspaper to recall political killings in the country in the past years as reason President Buhari should fail or be justified to fail to contain the banditry in the north west and the Fulani herdsmen killings across the country.
Several stakeholders of goodwill in the Nigerian project were of the view that at a time President Buhari is in dire need of intelligent people around who can help him proffer solutions to the teething problems confronting Nigeria under his leadership, all he could get are demagogues singing praises on the mounting failure, and perhaps, encouraging the failures. The stakeholders maintained that at the end, President Buhari’s name would be in the news and not the demagogues.
The stakeholders were thrown into consternation sighting an advertorial in the Punch newspaper on Sunday, July 21, 2019, P. 36, with the heading: Obasanjo administration’s Law and Order: Murders between 29 May 1999 to 29 May, 2007.
The one-page advertorial listed High profile cases of assassinated state and political actors who include Bola Ige, former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice 2001; Chief (Mrs.) Barnabas Igwe 2002; Marshal Harry 2003.
The group further reeled out catalogue of other killings identified as List of Assassinations.
The advertorial put up weak defence for President Buhari over the inability to contain the insecurity crisis in the country.
The advertorial was, thereafter signed by Buhari Media Organization.  Nigerians wondered why that should be the best advice of the presidential group to their principal at the time Nigeria’s national integration is under siege.
