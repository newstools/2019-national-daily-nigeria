After drawing public fire for parrying the quesions on the ethnic identity of the killers of Funke Olakunrin, daughter of the Afenifere leader Reuben Fasoranti, the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, was a little careful at the commemoration service for the dead.
Tinubu praised Olakunrin, said she extended her goodwill to all when she lived.
“All who encountered Funke attests to her goodness, nobleness, decency. She meant no harm to no one, extended goodwill and empathy to all.
He then called on lovers of peace to unite and put an end to the crimes in Nigeria.
“In the spirit of Funke, let those who love peace, regardless of religion, tribe or political affiliation, come together so that we do all we can to put an end to such criminality in our society,” the former Lagos Governor said.
The event took place at The Harbour Point in Victoria Island, Lagos on Saturday.
 
Olakunri was shot dead by suspected armed bandits along the Benin-Ore expressway, while heading to Lagos from Akure, the Ondo state capital.
