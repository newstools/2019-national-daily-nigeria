Report reaching National Daily has it that Harry Maguire is prepared to talk to Manchester United about a move from Leicester City.
But the transfer can only happen if the Foxes and the Red Devils are able to agree on a transfer fee first.
Leicester who have rejected two previoys offers from United are demanding a massive Â£90million to let their star player go.
Meanwhile, United are reluctant to pay that with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer already insisting his side would not overspend in the market.
But whether they change their mind before the August 8 deadline remains to be seen
