President Muhammadu Buhari has reassured of the release of victims of Boko Haram kidnapping in north east Nigeria. The President disclosed that contacts are being made with the Boko Haram fighters for the release of those in their captivity, maintaining that negotiations are still going on for the freedom of the kidnapped humanitarian aid workers and other victims.
The President acknowledged a video of where Grace Taku, one of the aid workers in captivity, was begging for urgent intervention of the federal government and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to save her life and that of others.
President Buhari in a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Assistant on Media and Publicity, reaffirmed the commitment of the government to secure the freedom of the captives.
Shehu Garba had on his facebook page written: “The Presidency has been briefed by the responsible government agency about the disturbing video showing our citizens, the humanitarian aid workers held captive. “The Presidency has been given assurances that contact is being made and the captors are being talked to.
“Beside these aid workers, there are some others about whom this engagement is about-Leah Sharibu, a religious leader and all the others. These discussions have been ongoing even before this time and what this latest incident has done is to bring urgency to the efforts that the secret service is making.
“Government is making contacts, in the hope that the captors will see reason to not visit hardship or even harm on these innocent individuals.”
