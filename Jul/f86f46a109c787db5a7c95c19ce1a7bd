The national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) visited the leader of the Afenifere cultural group in the southwest Nigeria, Chief Rueben Fasoranti, over the murder his daughter, Funke Olakunrin,last Friday at Ore, Ondo State, in a show of solidarity. The APC national leader resisted pressure to admit that the deceased was killed by Fulani herdsmen, an issue that has been generating tension across the country since the Friday murder. Report of the visit showed that the former Lagos State Governor subtly shielded the Fulani herdsmen from the murder of Funke and skillfully pushed the incident to the broader national insecurity challenges in Nigeria or the many years of insecurity in the country.
National Dailylearned that Tinubu in a media interaction during the condolence visit to Fasoranti in Ondo State, accompanied by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, declined acknowledging the Fulani herdsmen as killers of Funke as being reported by the media. Tinubu was cited to have said: “Excuse me, I am extremely concerned about security and I don’t want a stigma.
“How many years ago have we faced insecurity in this country and cases of kidnapping; is Evans who was arrested and his disclosure then, a herdsman?
“I don’t want to be political. The question is where are the cows?”
