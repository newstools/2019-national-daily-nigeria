The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has issued Senator-elect for Imo North, Benjamin Uwajumogu, his Certificate of Return.
Uwajumogu contested the election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
INEC issued the certificate about 4pm on Thursday at its headquarters in Abuja.
Uwajumogu, who addressed reporters after collecting the certificate, praised the judiciary for standing by the truth. He also hailed INEC for obeying court order, pledging to rededicate himself to serving Imo North better than he did in the eight senate.
The Senator-elect thanked his constituents for not taking laws into their hands during the trying times.
