The National Leader of the APC has reacted to the publicity by a bunch of eager-beavers that already began mobilising for him against the presidency in 2023.
Bola Tinubu stated months ago he was under pressure to contest the residency in 20123, since it is going to the southwestern zone.
And political juggernauts like Senator Ogunlewe and others have been volunteering to work for him if he decides to run for the office.
A group, Asiwaju Reloaded Ambassadors, just sprang up, and its members, in caps, T-shirts were distributing handbills  tagged Tinubu 2023.
Tinubu, however, has distanced himself from the group.
He denied the group and its materials in circulation in a series of tweets signed by his Media Office and posted on his official Twitter handle.
“We have seen pictures of face caps, T shirts, shirts and even leaflets with Bola Tinubu 2023 embossed on them purportedly by a faceless group which christened itself ‘Asiwaju Reloaded Ambassadors’ Nigeria’.
“Neither the group nor its souvenirs are known to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.
“We hereby, through this medium, categorically deny any knowledge of the group and dissociates Asiwaju Tinubu from the group’s unsolicited and unwarranted materials,” the tweet reads.
