President Muhammadu Buhari has boosted the Nigerian textile manufacturers.
According to Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, Buhari has ordered all Federal Government agencies, using uniforms to henceforth buy only Nigerian textile and garment industries.
The order will affect the army, navy, air force, police, civil defence and National Youth Service Corps, which have distinguishing uniforms.
The Central Bank governor recently unveiled a credit programme to resuscitate Nigeriaâ€™s textile industry, to help reduce unemployment in the country.
