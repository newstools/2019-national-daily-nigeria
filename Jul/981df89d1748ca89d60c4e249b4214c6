Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila has cleared the air on the relationship between him and his campaign director Abdulmulmin Jibrin after the House leadership election.
There had been reports the Speaker disappointed Jibrin, among others that worked for him, by giving them no committee to head.
But Gbajabiamila explained that Jibrin declined the chairmanship of any committee, though he was involved in their composition.
According to him, the lawmaker from Kano wanted to leave the legislative arm for fresh challenge, but was persuaded to wait a bit longer.
“Jubrin is now fully ready to perform his legislative duty. Let me clarify that he was not excluded from the leadership composition. He was involved in the composition process and declined accepting any committee leadership,” he tweeted on Friday.
“Jubrin had, repeatedly, made clear his intention to leave. My persuasions and that of some other leaders convinced him, reluctantly, to stay a bit longer.
“He wants a fresh challenge and his preference will be to return to the university and pursue his professorial ambition, face his private business or serve in the executive arm of public service.
“I have no doubt, whatever he decides, he will be of immense value. He has had a meritorious career in NASS over the last decade.”
Jibrin also hinted in March this will be his last tenure as a rep.
