Former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, on Monday asked Nigerians to remember he warned them against voting Muhammadu Buhari as President.

This was as he prayed that God should save the country from heightened issues of killings, kidnappings, joblessness, poverty and alleged cluelessness of President Buhari’s administration.

The former governor was reacting to the killing of Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, who was allegedly killed in Ondo State on Friday by suspected herdsmen.

He wrote, “Nigerians, may God save us in this ‘Next Level’ of killings, kidnappings, joblessness, poverty, cluelessness and recession…Fasten your Seat Belts. Remember I warned against Sai Buhari! Mo ke to o!

“Baba Fasoranti, I sympathise with you and other Nigerians. God will console you.”

The former Ekiti State governor and a chieftain of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who is currently being prosecuted for corruption by the Federal Government, remains one of Buhari’s fiercest critics.
