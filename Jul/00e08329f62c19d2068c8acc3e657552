Christian and Muslim Communities in Igbaye, Odo-Otin Local Government Area of Osun State have come against crimes and social vices like drug abuse, cultism and hooliganism associated with the youth in the town.
The coalition spearheaded by community elders and religious leaders in collaboration with the security agencies at the instance of some town’s elites under the umbrella of Igbaye Development Vanguard (ICV).
The concerned elders floated the coalition to enlighten the youth and elders  about the implication of crimes, drug abuse and acts of brigandage.

Speaking after the joint interdenominational prayers at the town’s market square, the Chief Missioner of the Muslim Community, Sheikh Abdur-Razaq Odewale and the Local Chairman of the Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN), Ven Benjamin Adegoke admitted that the coalition was formed to foster unity among the residents as well as to curb the rate of social vices among the youth.
According to Odewale, who is also the Founder and Proprietor of Darus-Salam Arabic and Islamic Studies in the town, the prayers and sensitisation efforts were aimed at letting the youth turn a new leaf from bad behaviours with a view to making them good leaders of tomorrow and good ambassadors of the town.
Ven Adegoke, who also doubles as the Pastor of the All Saints Church, added that the youth have been made to realise that any act of social vices has tendencies of spoiling family name just as it has the potential of turning the town a pariah.
The cleric, who was once the Principal of Igbaye Community High School (ICHS), informed that, the coalition has gone round all the schools, both public and private to warn the students and pupils alike against social vices like stealing, drug abuse and cultism and their adverse effect on their persons as well as on their parents and the society at large.
