APC’s National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole and his godson Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki might have buried the hatchet.
The two feuding politicians met at Aso Rock Thursday for the first time in about a year
They were asked bysome photojournalists to pose for a shot. They did, shakig hands.
Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi also joined them.
“We are not quarreling here,” Fayemi said, joking.
The two might have found mutual benefits in kissing and making up.
For one, Obaseki stands to lose a re-election ticket if the fights continues. Oshiomhole , too, has corruption allegation baggage the governor is willing to probe in Edo.
