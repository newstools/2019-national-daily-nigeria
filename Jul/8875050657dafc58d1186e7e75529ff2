Following the unfortunate airside incursion at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos today, July 19, 2019, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has suspended indefinitely the Aviation Security unit heads who were on duty when the incident occurred, pending completion of ongoing investigation into the regrettable security infringement.

Recall that earlier today, passengers onboard Asman Air aircraft panicked when an unidentified man, carrying a bag disrupted flight operations at Murtala Muhammed Airport II, after climbing on wings of the aircraft a few minutes to take-off.

A viral video showed a man who looked ‘insane’ climbing the wing of the aircraft with a bag and tried to access the aircraft.

Henriatta Yakubu, general manager, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) who confirmed the developments said the man has been apprehended and the authority is carrying out investigations into the incident.

In a released signed by Henrietta Yakubu, pending outcome of the investigation, the Airport Chief of Security, Mamman Mohammed Sadiku, International Terminal Security Officer, Oni Adedamola Abiodun, Head of Department Domestic Terminal 2, Owotor Kenneth Okezie and Head of Department Domestic Terminal 1, Badejo Adebowale Ayodele would remained suspended.

She said in the interim, a General Manager of the Authority, Dr. Anne Enyinnaya-Egbadon, has been detailed to take charge of security at the airport. Other affected officers have also been replaced.

According to her, the current arrangement is aimed at ensuring an efficient and thorough investigation towards the recovery and sustenance of the airport’s proactive security integrity.

“FAAN views this breach as a serious security concern and has commenced investigation to ascertain the remote and immediate causes of this incident to forestall future occurrence,” she added.
