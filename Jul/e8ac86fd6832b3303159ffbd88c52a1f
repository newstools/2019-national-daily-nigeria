President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sorrow over the passage of veteran sports journalist, Akinloye Oyebanji, aged 62.

He condoled with Oyebanji’s family, friends and colleagues particularly at the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), where he worked for 35 years, making his mark as a sportscaster.

Buhari recalled that the deceased was very good at his art, and would be sorely missed by the sporting community.

A statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, prayed that Oyebanji’s soul finds eternal rest and that God would comfort all those that mourn him.

Oyebanji served the NTA for 35 years in different capacities, including being a sports broadcaster, and later as General Manager (Sports).

He retired as Managing Director of NTA Properties at the authority’s headquarters in Abuja.

Oyebanji, who hailed from Kwara State, is survived by four children and a wife.
