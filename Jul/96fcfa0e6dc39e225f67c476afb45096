Femi Fani-Kayode at the weekend blasted Dele Momodu, Publisher of Ovation Magazine, over the latter’s claim of exclusive power to solve Nigeria’s problems he ascribed to President Muhammadu Buhari, as the father of the nation. But Fani-Kayode refuted Momodu’s claim, saying President Buhari is father of the Fulani, not the nation.
National Daily learned that Dele Momodu in a tweet indicated that only President Buhari can stop the killings in the country because he is ‘the father of the nation’.
“Only one man can stop the imminent explosion and that is the father of the nation, President Muhammadu Buhari” he tweeted.
Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister and PDP Chieftain blasted Momodu over his illusion, arguing that that President Buhari cannot stop the ‘explosion’ because he started it. Fani-Kayode reiterated that President Buhari is the ‘father of the fulanis’.
“Buhari cannot stop the imminent explosion because he is the cause of it!
“Buhari is not the father of the nation: he is the father of the Fulani!” Fani-Kayode declared.
