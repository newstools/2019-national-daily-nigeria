Manchester United have announced young goalkeeper Dean Henderson has signed a new contract before joining Sheffield United in another season loan.
 
The 22-year-old was instrumental in the Blades’ promotion to the Premier League , winning the Golden Glove for the most clean sheets in the Championship.
 
And he will now return to Bramall Lane for another year, after extending his deal with the Red Devils until June 2022.
 
Ole Gunner Solskjaer said of the Man United’s academy graduate: “Dean had a fantastic season at Sheffield United and has a big future ahead of him so I am delighted that he has signed this contract.
 
“He is another top-level talent that has come through the Academy to continue the proud tradition of producing players capable of playing in the first team.
 
“We have great faith in Dean’s ability; he has huge potential and his spirit and passion will stand him in good stead this year. We wish Dean the best of luck with his loan move. The opportunity to play a full season of Premier League football is perfect for his development.”
 
In other news, Sheffield United have announced their sixth summer signing – Nottingham Forest midfielder Ben Osborn.
 
The 24-year-old has signed a three-year contract with the Premier League new boys for an undisclosed fee.
 
Osborn made over 200 appearances for Forest, scoring 15 goals, and Blades manager Chris Wilder has said the club beat competition from three other clubs for his signature.
 
“Ben is an intelligent footballer, and we are delighted he is a Sheffield United player,” said boss Wilder.
