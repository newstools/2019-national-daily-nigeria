Manchester United have been open to letting Alexis Sanchez go this transfer window despite his goalscoring form for Chile, reports say.
Sanchez has been in stunning form for Chile at the Copa America, helping his side reach the semi-finals of the competition.
Yet despite his form, the Manchester Evening News say that United have been open to offloading the forward for much of the summer.
But finding a buyer has proven tricky.
Sanchez is on gargantuan wages of £500,000-a-week at United and has been the club’s highest earner ever since arriving from Arsenal in January 2018.
