“We are happy because it was in this wonderful stadium. We know that Egypt is a little bit sad and disappointed but I hope that we can give them good football to play and in a spectacular way.”

Rohr expressed caution regarding the feeling back home in Nigeria that the Eagles are now good for the title after they muscled their way into the last four.

“I hope so but we must win the semi-final first before dreaming of winning the cup. It will be a tough game either Algeria or Cote ‘d’ Ivoire.

“Our target was to go get to the semi-final stage because we are number three in Africa so we have to be in this position also to be on that level. But it was so difficult because the game was very close.


We are looking forward to the next game and are very happy about this victory. We can watch the game between Algeria and Cote d’Ivoire with relaxed minds.
