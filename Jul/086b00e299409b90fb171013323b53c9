The National Working Committee the ruling APC has upheld the expulsion of the party’s National Vice Chairman (North West), Malam Inuwa Abdulkadir over anti-party activities by the party’s organs in Sokoto State.
A statement signed by the party National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, confirmed this in Abuja on Thursday.
The disciplinary actions were taken by Magajin Gari “A” Ward, Sokoto North Local Government, and the Party’s Sokoto State Executive Committee.
“The party organs in Sokoto State have earlier expelled Abdulkadir and passed on their recommendation to the NWC for ratification,” Issa Onilu said in the statement.
“The decision to uphold the action of the Sokoto APC organs was taken at a meeting of the NWC held at the party’s national secretariat on Thursday,” the party spokesman said in the statement.
“Abdulkadir failed to utilise the opportunity to defend himself before the disciplinary committee set up by the NWC to look into the various petitions received against certain members of the party.
“Following the suspension of Abdulkadir, the NWC will subsequently forward the decision of the Sokoto State organs to the Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) for further actions.”
The first national vice chairman that tasted rudtication was Lawali Shuaibu from Zamfara.
He, for personal reason, mounted a campaign against his boss in May, and he didn’t survive the blowback.
