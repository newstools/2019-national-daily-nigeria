President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday warned sectional leaders across the country against making provocative statements over the gruesome murder of Mrs. Funke Olakunri, daughter of Afenifere leader, Reuben Fasoranti, by gunmen at Ore, Ondo State, on her way to Lagos last Friday.
President Buhari in a statement on Monday by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant, on Media and Publicity, acknowledged public concerns on the unfortunate attack leading to the death of the daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti.
The statement recalled that President Buhari has already issued a statement expressing his heartfelt condolences to the family of Funke Olakunri and followed up with a telephone call.
It added that the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, has in addition, paid a visit to the grieving family in Akure, Ondo State.
“Her death is a tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family,” Buhari declared.
The President, however, cautioned: “It is incumbent on all leaders across the country to consider their language and its potential consequences.”
Buhari, accordingly, declared: “Insecurity is an issue that Nigeria must face together as one nation – united.
“Times of tragedy like these are not the time for politics. It reveals only disrespect for the departed and her family. “And we hope that those who stand in positions of influence recognise and understand this.”
