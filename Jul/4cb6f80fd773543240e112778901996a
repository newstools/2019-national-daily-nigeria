Manchester United will accelerate deals for Bruno Fernandes and Sean Longstaff this week.
Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are already through the door for a combined £65million – but the spending doesn’t stop there.
The Manchester Evening News claim Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants Newcastle’s Longstaff, 21, signed before their pre-season tour starts next week.
A fee in the region of £25million could be enough to convince Mike Ashley to sell.
Meanwhile The Sun say Fernandes’ agent is set for talks with Ed Woodward, who believes he can barter Sporting Lisbon down from £62m to £50m.
