Tottenham have become the more attractive club to sign for over north London rivals Arsenal, according to Ian Holloway.
 
And the former Premier League boss says that’s down to one man – Mauricio Pochettino.
 
Both clubs have been active in the transfer window recently, with the Gunners confirming deals for Dani Ceballos and William Saliba yesterday while Spurs, finally, have signed Jack Clarke and Tanguy Ndombele and have been linked with further deals for Paulo Dybala and Giovani Lo Celso.
 
Ollie said on Friday’s Sports Breakfast: “If I was a young player right now I would probably go to Spurs, because of their manager.
 
“Mr Emery has a fantastic record and is a brilliant manager, but for me there’s something about Pochettino that would make me want to die for him.”
 
 
In other news, Neil Lennon insists Celtic will not be caught cold if Arsenal make a late move for Kieran Tierney.
 
The £25million-rated left-back has been the subject of two failed bids from the Gunners but Lennon confirmed he has already drawn up contingency plans in case the 22-year-old is praised away from his boyhood club.
 
Unai Emery is understood to be ready to revive his interest in the Scotland international but the Spaniard has just 13 days to make his move before the Premier League transfer deadline on August 8.
