The Barcelona dressing room and the club’s supporters would be thrilled to see Neymar return.
That’s according to new Celta Vigo signing and former Barcelona midfielder Denis Suarez.
Suarez, who spent a miserable six-months at Arsenal, also thinks Neymar made the wrong decision to leave the Nou Camp in 2017.
“For me it was a wrong decision he made, but I think that the dressing room and all the fans, in my opinion, would be delighted with his return, he is a great player and he has to go back to Barcelona.”
Also, in same vein, Chelsea have opened talks with England Under-21 midfielder Mason Mount over a new contract at Stamford Bridge.
Mount, 20, impressed on loan with Derby last season – netting 11 goals and providing six assists in 44 appearances.
And now, with Frank Lampard at the helm, Mount will receive a new long-term deal.
Goal claim talks have already begun despite Mount on holiday after England’s disastrous Under-21 European Championships campaign.
