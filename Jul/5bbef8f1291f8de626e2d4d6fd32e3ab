THE Senator-elect for Imo North Benjamin Uwajumogu on Monday protested at the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) demanding the release of his Certificate of Return.

Uwajumogu had secured an order of a Abuja Federal High Court, directing INEC to release the Certificate of Return, but three weeks after the judgment, INEC is yet to comply.
INEC had refused to give the Senator his Certificate of Return on the excuse that he was wrongly declared winner of the election. It said it has set up a committee to investigate the veracity or otherwise of claims of misconduct during the election, a decision he challenged in court.

Director-General of Benjamin Uwajumogu Campaign Organisation Matthew Omegara said INEC should be held responsible for any break down of law and order. He gave the commission 24 hours to release the certificate.
Uwajumogu said he approached the Federal High Court as a law abiding citizen, and got a judgment instructing INEC to release his Certificate of Return, adding that till date, INEC is yet to obey the judgment.
“I am here today to collect my Certificate of Return, but INEC has refused to issue me the certificate. I am asking it to do that to forestall a breakdown of law and order. I am prepared to do whatever it will take to get my Certificate of Return,” he added.
