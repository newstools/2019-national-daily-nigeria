The Taraba State Government has enacted a death sentence law for kidnappers.
Governor Darius Ishaku, on Wednesday, signed into law a bill that prescribes death sentence as penalty for kidnapping and abduction.
The bill was sponsored by the Speaker of the Taraba State House of Assembly Peter Abel Diah and passed with overwhelming support by members of the state House of Assembly.
“The law is a product of government’s concern about insecurity in the state, particularly, kidnapping for money which is rampant in the state and other parts of the country,” the governor said.
No fewer than a hundred Taraba residents and visitors have been kidnapped, in recent times, sometimes from their homes. Many of the kidnapped were killed by the criminals.
