Tottenham left-back Danny Rose’s wage demands have scared off Newcastle United, according to The Sun.

The Magpies were prepared to offer the England international around £50,000 per week, but he’s unwilling to take a pay cut from the £60,000 a week he’s earning in North London.

The 29-year-old is for sale and has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus, with PSG in pole position owing to the salary they’re prepared to offer, according to the report.
Also, Hodgson unhappy with Palace transfer business.
Roy Hodgson has said he thought he and the Crystal Palace board were on the same page regarding transfers, but that he’s unhappy more significant additions haven’t been made to the Eagles squad.

Palace lost Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United for £50m ($62m), and have only brought in Andre Ayew.

Talking to Sky Sports Hodgson said the club needed bodies, but backed sporting director Dougie Freedman and chairman Steve Parrish to bring players in.
