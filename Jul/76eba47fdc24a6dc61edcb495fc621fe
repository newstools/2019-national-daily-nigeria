Ed Woodward will not fly out to China for the last leg of Manchester United’s pre-season tour as the club continues to work on two transfers.

Woodward has been present on every pre-season tour since he assumed the executive vice-chairman role in 2013 but will not travel to Shanghai, where United are preparing to play Tottenham on Thursday. United managing director Richard Arnold was in Singapore and has flown onto China.

United want two more signings amid interest in Leicester defender Harry Maguire and Newcastle midfielder Sean Longstaff. United have prioritised a deal for Maguire, having had a £70million bid rejected by Leicester, but are still in for Longstaff. A tweet on Monday claiming United were agreeing an £80m move for Maguire was false.
