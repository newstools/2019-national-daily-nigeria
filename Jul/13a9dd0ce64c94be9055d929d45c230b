The Senator who represented Kaduna Central at the 8th Senate, Shehu Sani, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari of the dangers of setting up the proposed Ruga settlement for herdsmen without the approval of the host communities.

The outspoken Senator said such action could be likened to one throwing “butter into a pan of hot oil”.

According to him, the practicability of Ruga is reliant on its acceptance by the host communities and not by Federal Government’s unilateralism or by its approval or objections by the state governors.

Sani stated this in a post on his Twitter handle on Monday in response to the ongoing argument on Buhari’s government proposal to establish Ruga settlement in the 36 states of the country.

“To establish Ruga in a hostile environment is like throwing butter into a pan of hot oil. The viability of Ruga is dependent on its acceptance by the host communities and not by FG’s unilateralism or by its approval or objections by the state governors,” Sani wrote.


According the Presidency, Ruga settlement “simply means rural settlement in which animal farmers, not just cattle herders, will be settled in an organized place with provision of necessary and adequate basic amenities such as schools, hospitals, road networks, vetinary clinics, markets and manufacturing entities that will process and add value to meats and animal products.”
