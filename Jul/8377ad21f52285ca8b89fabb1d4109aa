Anyanwu explained that Immediately we won the trophy, i wished he was still alive.  Maybe we would have played this match together”.

“I saw his wife on the stands during  the match with Abdulrazaq Aliyu who was my former team mate at Enyimba. The victory comes with mixed feelings for me.

  Here I am celebrating knowing  that I am part of history with Kano Pillars winning this Cup for the first time after 39 years of the club’s existence and at the same time being emotional, wishing my friend was still alive so we would have celebrated together. It would  have been a double blessing but God knows.” He added.
