The Amnesty International has demanded the Nigeria Police to investigate Senator Elisha Abbo, representing Adamawa North, whose assault video has gone viral on the social media in the 38 hours. The senator was caught in the video assaulting a staff of an adult shop he patronizes in Abuja.
National Dailygathered that in a series of posts on its verified twitter handle, @AmnestyNigeria, the global human rights watchdog condemned the lawmaker’s behavior, noting that the video of the senator assaulting women is widely available for the Police to carry out investigation.
Also, Festus Keyamo, Director of Strategic Communications and Spokesperson of the Buhari Presidential Campaign Organisation, had condemned the Senator’s public misconduct, demanding Police arrest of the lawmaker.
The APC stalwart, in a post on his verified twitter handle, @fkeyamo, declared that the case of Senator Elisha Abbo is very straightforward which requires no formal complaint.
More so, Amnesty International further advocated that the Police must immediately take three steps: 1. Arrest him (no formal complaint is needed with the evidence on tape) 2. Obtain his statement (if he’s willing to make one) and that of the victim and 3. Arraign him in court.
A video showing the senator beating up a woman in a sex toy shop in Abuja has generated wide condemnation with many calling for his prosecution and ouster as a lawmaker.
National Dailygathered that protesters have spread across several streets of Abuja demanding the sanctioning of the Senator by appropriate authorities, including the Senate.
Meanwhile, the Senate has set up an ad-hoc committee chaired by Senator Sam Egwu to investigate the Abbo over the assault of the female shop attendant.
