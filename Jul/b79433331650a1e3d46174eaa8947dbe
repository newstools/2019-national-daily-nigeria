A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri on Thursday, says he has incontrovertible document that document that showed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) deployed the use of computer server for electronic transmission of the 2019 election results.
Recall that INEC had stated before the presidential elections petitions tribunal that it had no server for election results in contrast to the claims by the presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar.
However, Omokri claimed in a post on his verified Twitter handle on Thursday that the supposed document in his possession has the URL address of INEC Nigeria’s server.
He added that the document contained state-by-state breakdown of compliance with returning of presidential elections data to the server.
“I am now in possession of INCONTROVERTIBLE PROOF that INEC has and had a server, in form of a SIGNED ADMISSION by INEC’s spokesperson.
“In fact the document has the URL address of INEC’s server, plus state by state breakdown of compliance with returning of Presidential elections data to the server, and warning to those states who refuse to comply,” he wrote.
