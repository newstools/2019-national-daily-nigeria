Fresh tension rises in Kaduna State as the High Court in the state on Thursday turned down the request by Sheikh Ibrahim Elzakzaky, leader of the Shi’ites Muslim, to be granted leave for an overseas medical trip.
National Daily gathered that in the early hours of Thursday members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), took over major roads to the High Court in Kaduna, as the court resumed hearing in the suit by their leader seeking leave to travel to India for medical attention.
IMN members were said to have blocked all roads leading to the court, compelling security operatives to be on red alert against any act of violence or threat to breakdown of law and order in the state.
Residents of Kaduna were said to be stranded on the road and had to trek several kilometers to their offices and business locations because commercial vehicles were forced off the road by the Shi’ites Muslims who converged to express solidarity to their leader.
The High Court, however, failed to deliver judgment on the suit, the court rather adjourned hearing in Ibrahim El Zakzaky’s suit, seeking permission to travel to India for medical attention to July 29.
