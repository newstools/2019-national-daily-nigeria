The national Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has waged a counter war against the APC National Vice Chairman north west, Inuwa Abdulkadir, who wrote the party chairman to resign citing leadership failure that caused the party’s loss of Zamfara State and others in the 2019 general elections.
Relying on the party’s political machine, the APC  National Working Committee (NWC) declared the expulsion of Inuwa Abdulkadir from the party citing anti-party activities. The committee, accordingly, upheld the disciplinaryactions of Magajin Gari “A” Ward, Sokoto North Local Government, and the Party’s Sokoto State Executive Committee on the party’s National Vice Chairman, North West, Inuwa Abdulkadir over anti-party activities.
National Daily learned that the State APC in Sokoto had earlier expelled Inuwa Abdulkadir and passed on their recommendation to the NWC for ratification.
APC National publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement in Abuja at the weekend, explained that the decision to uphold the resolutions of the Sokoto APC was taken at a meeting of the NWC at the Party’s National Secretariat Saturday.
