Commends Shi’ites Muslim protesters




 
The fugitive leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari to release the long-detained leader of the Shi’ite Muslims in Nigeria, Sheikh Ibrahim El Zakzaky, which he said is in compliance with the rule of law. Kanu told the President that disobedience to the rule of law is invitation anarchy.
The IPOB leader commended members of the Islamic Movement of Nigerian (IMN), the Shi’ite Muslims for their persistent protest and agitation for the release of their leader.
Kanu in a tweet, wrote: “Fulani agents of hate in Aso Rock MUST release Sheikh El Zakzaky. Rule of law demands it, disobedience of it invites anarchy.
“IMN protesters should be commended for their exceptional bravery and steadfastness in the face of unprecedented tyranny. Our support and prayers are with them.”
