The former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Godswill Akpabio, is still relishing in the colossal defeat he suffered in the 2019 general elections in Akwa Ibom State after he had exalted himself to a political colossus in the state.
National Daily learned that the former Minority Leader of the Senate had after the elections visited the Catholic high command in Italy with his wife on religious tourism.
However, National Daily gathered that the General overseer of the Christ Deliverance Ministries Inc (CDM), Prophet Ekpong Ituen, may be coming to the spiritual assistance of the former senator when he predicted that Senator Akpabio will regain his seat in the Senate.
The prophet did not specify how Akpabio will regain his seat in the National Assembly but simply predicted that the former Akwa Ibom State governor will return to the Senate in Abuja. He was said to have maintained that, “Akpabio will reclaim his mandate, though, it may take a while.” Perhaps, Prophet Ituen may be relying on the petition at the tribunal.
There were indications that Prophet Ituen may have been expressing his solidarity for Akpabio. The prophet was reported to have admitted that certain recent events made him develop love for Senator Akpabio. He is, therefore, perceived to be providing spiritual support for the former senator.
