United don’t want Gareth Bale but that hasn’t stopped pundits from discussing the possibility of him joining the club.

This morning, it was the turn of Danny Mills, a League Cup winner with Middlesbrough in 2004, to explain why Bale would be wrong to join United.

“People keep saying he’s got to come back to the Premier League and win something here, and then they’re saying he should sign for Manchester United,” Mills said.

“How long is this contract he’s going to sign? Eight years? When are Manchester United going to win the Champions League or Premier League? It’s not going to be within the next three years is it?

“He currently has three choices on the table…

“One: Stay at Real Madrid for around £500,000-a-week, stay there for three years, fight for his place and maybe not play an awful lot of football.

“Two: Go to China, double his wages for the next three seasons and play for a bit of fun, do whatever he wants to do.

“Or Three: Come back to the Premier League and take at least half [what he’s earning now at Real Madrid]. What, £300,000-a-week? Maybe not even that. What clubs are going to pay that?

“He’s not going to Liverpool or Manchester City, Chelsea can’t sign anybody, he’s certainly not going to go to Tottenham or Arsenal for that sort of money.

“So he’s left with Manchester United, and they are not going to win something in the next three seasons that is significant enough for Gareth Bale.”
