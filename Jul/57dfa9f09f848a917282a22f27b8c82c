Hours to the planned mass action against the Ruga Settlement Projects, President Muhammadu Buhari has suspended the policy implementation till further notice.
The scheme, according to presidency, was an idea designed to stem the tide of herdsmen/farmers clashes across the country.
But many states affected and members of the public have understood it as another form of the proposed cattle colony by the federal government.
Some members of the public and civil society groups had also planned mass action in Abuja against the scheme, on Friday, 5th July, 2019.
But a source close to the presidency hinted newsmen on Wednesday, that President Buhari may have resolved to suspend the scheme till further consultations.
After consultations with stakeholders, Buhari was said to have resolved to put away the idea for a thorough review and well-accepted approach to end the constant clashes between herdsmen and farmers.
The suspension would be announced any moment from now, with detailed explanations.
