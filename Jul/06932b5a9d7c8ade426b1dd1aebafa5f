Former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, at the screening of ministerial nominees on Monday in Abuja, mocked the former Governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, who was Minister of Power, Works and Housing, in the first tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari, of carrying heavy load that is speeding up his aging. Okorocha ridiculed Fashola that he was so overwhelmed by the three ministries assigned to him by President Buhari which, he noted, made Fashola began to have grey hair at 56 years.
Okorocha was of the view that the former power, works and housing minister has grown grey hair because of the tremendous work of supervising three ministries.
“The three ministries are too large for one person. Look at my friend; he now has grey hair,” Okorocha had said.
Meanwhile, other nominees to be screened by the Senate on Monday include former Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State, Geoffrey Onyema (Enugu), Gbemisola Saraki (Kwara), Maryam Katagum (Bauchi), Muhammadu Mahmoud (Kaduna State), Clement Agba (Edo) and Suleiman Adamu (Jigawa).
The other three of the remaining 12 nominees who include Sabo Nanunu (Kano), Saleh Mamman (Taraba) and Lai Mohammed (Kwara), will be screened on Tuesday.
