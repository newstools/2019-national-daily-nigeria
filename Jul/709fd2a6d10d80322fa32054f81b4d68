Defender Lovren, 29, has been heavily linked with a switch to AC Milan but Sky Sports say an approach is yet to be made and that they have no plans to sell.
Lovren was firmly behind Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip in the Liverpool pecking order last season and made only 11 Premier League starts.
But selling the Croatian would leave Liverpool needing to replace him and Klopp has already said he does not expect to be busy in the summer transfer window.
In other transfer news, Unai Emery wants the left-back at the Emirates Stadium next season but Napoli are believed to be showing interest.
However, CalcioNapoli24 report that an insider has revealed Tierney is more likely to join the Gunners than move to Serie A this summer.
But the same source also confirmed Napoliâ€™s interest was genuine and talks have been held.
