The Inspector General of Police (IGP) M.A Adamu, has promised that the Nigeria Police will apprehend killers of Reuben Fasoranti’s daughter, Funke. The IG, accordingly, assured Nigerians that the killers of Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, daughter of the leader of Afenifere, Chief Reuben Fasorantin, will certainly be found and made to face the full weight of the law.
National Daily learned that the IGP disclosed that the Ondo State Police Command, supported by the Special Forces and seasoned investigators from the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) and the Technical Intelligence Unit (TIU) deployed from the Force Headquarters, Abuja, on his directives, have already commenced a massive manhunt for the killers with a view to tracking, arresting and bringing them to justice.
Condemning the heinous and barbaric crime, the IG of Police, was said to have ordered the total overhaul of security architecture on the highways straddling the Southern part of the country in his new measures to prevent re-occurrence of such incidence.
The IG had also ordered the Commissioners of Police in the affected States to ensure adequate security arrangement in their areas of jurisdiction (AOR). IG Adamu assured that the Force Headquarters has perfected plans to replicate the special security arrangement powered by “Operation Puff Adder” currently ongoing in Kaduna- Abuja expressway in key highways in the Southern part of the country.
Adamu reassured that the Force will not rest on its oars until sanity is restored in every nook and cranny of the country. He appealed for calm and support from all Nigerians, especially, residents of Ondo State, in assisting the current investigation.
