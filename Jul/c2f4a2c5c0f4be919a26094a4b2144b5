In the lead-up to the November guber election, Kogi will get attention. But the Wadas, an elite family in the north-central state, are sure to get more eyeballs.
Why?
Father and former Gov Idris Wada, his brother Musa Wada, and their brother-in-law Abubakar Ibrahim Idris are fighting it out for the PDP primary ticket, a quarry Sen. Dino Melaye is also gunning for.
While it looks like a family affair, it’s on the main going to end up a dog fight.
Abubakar is already facing opposition from his own brother who sees him as a stooge for their father Idris, a two-term ex-governor, too, itching to come back to power by proxy.
According to Suleman Idris, Abubkar is a political misfit.
“My father knows Abubakar doesn’t have the capacity to be a class prefect—not to talk of being a governor,”Sueman told a group of delegates in June.
He, however, supports Musa of the Wadas.
The man who boasted he helped former Gov Wada to power then warned the Wadas are not exactly the same, so they should not compare the former governor with his brother Musa.
The older Wada bought his nomination form and that of expression of interest on Monday, and he addressed newsmen on the need for him to snap out of retirement.
He said the November election is critical to the survival of Kogi which he said was on a path  of progress as of the time he left office.
“With the kind of money that’s coming into the hands of this present governor, Kogi would have become a state that all of us would have been proud of,” he said.
So if you bring a greenhorn, who has no proper knowledge of the workings of Kogi State, he will spend the first two years trying to find his feet.”
Sure among the greenhorns are his brother Musa, and his brother-in-law Aubakar.
