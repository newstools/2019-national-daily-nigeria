The Channels Television Reporter, Precious Owolabi hit by a stray bullet while covering the Shi’ites Muslims clash with the Police in Abuja on Monday, is dead.
The members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) have been protesting the continued detention of their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El Zakzaky, since 2016.
The Shi’ites Muslims have a fortnight ago invaded the national Assembly during the protest, obstructing the plenary of both chambers of the federal legislature.
The intervention of the Police and other security operatives to forestall the breakdown of law and order sparked off violence with the IMN protesters which led to the death of two Shi’ites Muslims and the injuring of some policemen.
The IMN members were restrained from extending their Monday protest into the heart of the Federal capital territory (FCT), the Federal Secretariat and its environs during the Monday protest but they turned violent to undermine the Police.
