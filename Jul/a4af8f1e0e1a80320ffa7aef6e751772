Newly signed Omonia Nicosia of Cyprus goalkeeper Francis Uzoho says he is ready to prove himself if he is called upon by coach Gernot Rohr to man the post for the Super Eagles in the round of 16 game against Cameroon, National Daily learnt.
Uzoho has lost his spot as first choice to Daniel Akpeyi and Rohr even confirmed that the 20 year old is also behind Ikechukwu Ezenwa in the pecking order in the Super Eagles, no thanks to the lack of game time he suffered last season at club level.

Rohr has already used the duo of Akpeyi and Ezenwa at the ongoing 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and Uzoho says he is ready to play his role if he is given the chance to play by the technical crew of the team.
” This is the biggest tournament in Africa so I definitely want to play in it but it’s not my decision to make and I will back whoever is selected to be in goal by the coach. That said I’m ready to give my best if given the chance against Cameroon. It would be a dream come true for me”, Uzoho said.
