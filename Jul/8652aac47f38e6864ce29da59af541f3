Juventus are hoping new Italian tax laws that are set to be introduced will help them sign Paul Pogba from Manchester United.

Spanish publication Marca claim the Italian government are set to cut tax rates for foreign football players.

The report says Italy will cut tax for foreign footballers from 47 per cent to 20 per cent in the north and from 40 per cent to 15 per cent in the south of the country.

Turin-based Juve would fall into the northern category.

Spain did something similar in 2005 when they passed what was dubbed ‘The Beckham Law’, which gave wealthy players from abroad significant tax advantages following David Beckham’s move from Manchester United to Real Madrid.

Marca add that Juventus are now doing all they can to re-sign a player they sold to United for what was then a world-record £89million in 2016.
