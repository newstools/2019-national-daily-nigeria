There are mixed reactions from Akwa Ibom State over the nomination of former Governor of the state, Godswill Akpabio, for ministerial appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari.
While in some parts of the state, there were wild celebrations, in some others, people expressed skepticism over the nominees credential.
A stakeholder in Akwa Ibom State threw up the riddle over the petition of the former governor at the election tribunal over the senatorial election won by Chris Ekpeyong. The former governor was said to have repeatedly boasted that he will reclaim the mandate, which he said was stolen. The stakeholder in Kawa Ibom polity, therefore challenged Akpabio: “If my big brother, Senator Akpabio, is so sure of reclaiming his stolen mandate, let him reject the ministerial appointment.”
However, APC national youth caucus chairman in Akwa Ibom State, Uyo, congratulated Apkabio on his nomination for ministerial appointment by the president.
Obong Iniobong John, Akwa Ibom State Chairman APC National Youth Caucus, in a statement declared: “His Excellency, Distinguished Senator Godswill Akpabio (CON),
Your Excellency, CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE. Your nomination as a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is well deserved.
On behalf of the entire membership and leadership of the Youth Caucus of our great party, I congratulate you and hope that you’ll use the position to attract federal government presence to the state. Once again, congratulations.”
