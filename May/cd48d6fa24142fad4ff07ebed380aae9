On Sunday evening, Baba Fryo, of the Denge Pose fame made a post on his Facebook page detailing his encounter with some Ojo Cantonment Barrack’s soldiers.
 
He said, “I was humiliated by unknown soldiers. I tried to force them to the barrack. But a female soldier interfered and allowed them to escape. The case is under investigation. Thanks to Ojo Army Barrack who took the case on their shoulder. I pray they will surely be caught and brought to book”.
 
 
Baba Fryo represents music stars from Ajegunle in the 90s. During his time, Ghetto music was a thing and his likes and Daddy Showkey dished out tunes that aired across the nation.

His hit single Denge Pose became widely accepted and played at all parties and public functions. While some of the Ajegunle super stars like Daddy Showkey have changed their base. As some now leave in places like Ikeja, Lekki, Ajah, Ikorodu and Ogba. The Denge Pose crooner still remained in the Ajegunele environs.
