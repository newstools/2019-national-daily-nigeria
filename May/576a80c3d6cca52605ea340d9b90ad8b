Okolie told our reporter on the ‘Super-Six’ playoff scheduled for Agege stadium, Lagos, Wednesday, his team is going to the spirit of champions to win the league
“I will continue to work hard to justify my inclusion whenever am called upon by the coach to serve and to be back to my peak again,” he said.
