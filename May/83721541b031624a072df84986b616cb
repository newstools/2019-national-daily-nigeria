The President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to conduct a psychiatric examination on the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, and other members of his cabinet.
 
Prof. Ogunyemi who said the examination was necessary to ascertain their mental stability, made the call in Abuja on Monday as members of organised Labour continued their protest and grounded activities at the Federal Secretariat, Abuja, for hours.
 
The university don made the comments after the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC)-led by its president, Ayuba Wabba, had taken to the streets to protest “unwarranted attack” on workers who went to picket Dr. Ngige’s Asokoro residence last week.
 
According to Prof. Ogunyemi, it is necessary to conduct the mental test due to the ongoing fracas between workers and the minister who ordinarily should understand the workings of labour.
 
“ASUU, as a union, condemn this attack on workers by a man who should protect and defence them. To say the least, we lost confidence in him.
 
“We are also calling on President Buhari to conduct a psychiatric test on each of his cabinet members to ascertain their mental stability to save the country an embarrassment as this,” he added.
