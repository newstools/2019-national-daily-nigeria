The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has alleged that the police and governors from the South East are both of covering up the atrocities of their “Fulani masters against our people”.
 
According to IPOB in a statement issued on Friday by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, the South-East was under attacks from Fulani terrorists, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, and some governors.
 
The statement issued by Emma Powerful highlighted three groups attacking innocent citizens in the South-East.

It said the the Southeast is under immense attack on the 3 notable fronts.“After a careful and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the demise of Anthony Nwoko, it became apparent that he was not murdered. The journalist that reported that he was found in a pool of blood was a police-sponsored writer who was paid to present fantasy as fact.
 
“No police autopsy report till date as to the cause of death. Enugu police said they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Nwoko’s death. No single photographic evidence or proof that blood was anywhere present on Nwoko’s body or apartment. These brown envelope journalists based in Lagos merely accepted money from the police to seek to incriminate IPOB without any single shred of evidence because they want to damage the squeaky clean image of IPOB in the hope of endearing themselves to their Fulani masters.
 
“All those that peddled this fake story or sought to extract a non-existent capital out of the lies that Nwoko was murdered, especially DSS established mushroom groups will never be forgiven. We shall find them and hold them accountable. The hunt is on for them across Biafraland. No traitor will go unpunished.”
