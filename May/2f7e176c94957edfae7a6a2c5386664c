It’s not every day we see thread of comments that are all positive about the Nigeria Police Force.

National Daily spotted a Facebook post of the Rapid Respond Squad. It was a post that had pictures of the policemen eating and drinking in their uniform together.

It had this caption:

“Today we broke our fast and had iftar together as a house. We pray that the Almighty Allah continues to accept our supplication as an act of Ibadah.#TheGoodGuys”.
 
And what followed as comments were quite positive. Christians and Muslims wished them well. And prayed for them
