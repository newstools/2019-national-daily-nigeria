The star goalkeeper at this year’s WAFU Nations Cup Chiamaka Nnadozie has declared that the Super Falcons No 1 jersey at next month’s World Cup is open for grabs.

The former Falconets shot stopper caught the eye in Abidjan when she stood in for her more experienced Rivers Angels rival Tochukwu Oluehi, who was injured.

“It will be a competition between the goalkeepers because we are all good and so anyone of us can do the job,” Nnadozie

“So, I believe anyone of us can be called upon (at the World Cup).”
