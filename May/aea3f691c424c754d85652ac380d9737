The petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PEGASSAN) has condemned the high rate of insurgency leading to spate of  killings of innocent citizens in some parts of the country especially areas predominantly occupied by Muslims.
The body, made the official reaction today in Lagos through its General secretary Comrade Lumumba Okugbawa while felicitating with Muslims across the country in this holy month of Ramadan.
According to him Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam. He therefore urged all Muslims to imbibe the true essence of this Holy period which teaches perseverance, tolerance, purity, love and refrain from all negativity of life such as anger and hatred which are not attribute of a true Muslim.
The Association therefore call on all Muslim faithful to use this period pray against all obstacles and challenges militating against the growth and development of the country, as well as newly elected public office holders.
He call on Nigerians to eschew things that can hamper the peaceful        co-existence of the nation as time has come for all citizens to rise against any form of terrorism and other acts of violence.
“Negative issues such as ethnic and religious chauvinism, often wrapped around religious cover to justify evil and un-islamic positions and this must be discourage” he added.
