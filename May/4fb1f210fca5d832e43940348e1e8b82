The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, has enjoined Nigerians, particularly Muslims, to use  the Ramadan period to pray that peace and love to continually reign in Nigeria.

According to Obasa,“The Ramadan period calls for sober reflection for all of us. It is a period that calls for us to move closer to God and we should not relent in our prayers for peace and love to reign in Nigeria,”

The Lagos Assembly Speaker, who is also the Chairman of Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, gave this advice in his message and greetings to Muslims for the commencement of the holy Ramadan (fasting).

As expressly stated in the Speaker’s salutory message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Musbau Rasak, Muslims the world over and especially Nigeria need to pray fervently to avert any breach of peace in the nation in the holy month of Ramadan.

“It is a period for us to be tolerant of each other. Ramadan goes beyond abstinence from food, drinks and sexual intercourse alone.  It is also the period for us to be reinvigorated and reinvest ourselves spiritually. We should continue to pray for continued peace and love in the country,” he said.

Rt. Hon. Obasa urged Nigerians to remain security conscious by being vigilant at all time.

“We have to assist security agencies in combating crimes by being vigilant at all time.

” We should refrain from utterances and actions that can cause breach of peace in the society. We should also endeavor to be watchful of our environment by promptly reporting to the security agencies any suspicious action, of person or group of people,” he said.

“On behalf of my colleagues in the Lagos State House of Assembly, I wish all Nigerian Muslims  a fulfilling and rewarding Ramadan. I pray that Almighty Allah accept it as an act of ‘Ibadah from all of us,” Obasa affirms.
