An Australian man who scored a $700,000 lottery jackpot said his numbers came to him in a dream 13 years earlier.
The East Devonport, Tasmania, man won a total $709,842.97 from the May 8 Wednesday Lotto drawing, and the winner said his numbers came from an unusual place.



“I’ve been playing these numbers for 13 years. I dreamt them one night — they appeared in my dream,” the man told TattsLotto officials. “I woke up and wrote them down, and I’ve been playing them ever since.”

“I thought one day I would see them all there. I hadn’t given up on them!” he said.

“They’ve won other prizes over the years, but this is the biggest prize so far.”
