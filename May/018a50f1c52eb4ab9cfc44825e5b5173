Barely days after the Deputy National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, (North), Senator Lawan Shuaibu, demanded for the resignation of the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, from office, another APC chieftain has backed the call.
 
Recall that Senator Shuaibu in a letter addressed to Oshiomhole entitled: “APC: It’s fortune and misfortune, time to act!” accused Oshiomhole of failing to improve on what he met at the party, hence the need for him to step down as APC’s leader.
 
Former Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, on Thursday, backed the call of Senator Shuaibu for Oshiomhole to resign, adding that if he was allowed to remain, APC would go down when President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term was over.

He said, “The truth is with Oshiomhole this party would go down by the time President Muhammadu Buhari finishes his 2nd term.
 
“Oshiomhole is full of himself and he has an ego problem and wants to dominate every environment and democracy is not like that.
 
“I know that many of us who are conscionable members of the party who think of the future of this party and the fact that this party should continue to be relevant even after President Muhammad Buhari has left office would stand by this call. We are concerned and everything that we can do to force him out, we will do it.”
