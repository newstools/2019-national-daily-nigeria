No fewer than seven bandits walked into an ambush laid by angry residents of Birnin Magaji Local Government Area of Zamfara State on Wednesday.
The armed bandits went to the emir’s palace to seek release of their cattle seized following an earlier airstrike on their base in Birnin Magaji forest.
On April 4, many residents followed the soldiers into the forest where they found over 200 rustled cows. The bandits abandoned them in the wake of an air strike.
The cows were herded to the emir’s palace in Birnin Magaji, ad later taken to Gusau
According to residents, on Wednesday, some suspected bandits and a person suspected to be an official of the State Security Service (SSS) came to the emir’s palace—to plead for the release of their cattle, resi.
The Emir of Birnin Magaji, Husseini Dan-Ali, was, however, not around, but his secretary hosted them inside the palace.
The community however learnt about the mission of the visitors, and then moved to burn down the palace. The soldiers on guard pleaded with them.
Not done yet, the residents decided to wait outside until the suspected bandits came out—straight into an ambush. All of them except the SSS officer were killed by the angry community.
Zamfara has been boiling lately owing to invasion by bandits and cattle rustlers killing hundreds of people.
The federal government has responded by sending ground and aerial troops.
