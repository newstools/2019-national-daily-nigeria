A Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday, further adjourned until June 10, the trial of former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, who is facing N6.9 billion fraud charges.
The case which was slated for continuation of trial, was further adjourned, as Justice Mojisola Olatoregun was said to be away on official assignment.
Trial will resume on next adjourned date.
Fayose was arraigned on 11 counts by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on October 22, 2018, alongside a company, Spotless Investment Ltd.
He pleaded not guilty and was granted bail in the sum of N50 million with one surety in like sum.

The EFCC opened its case on November 19, 2018, and had so far called 13 witnesses.
At the last adjourned date, on May 10, the prosecution had sought an adjournment of the case, after it informed the court that its 13th witness, Adewale Aladegbola, seemed to be hostile.
The court had consequently adjourned the case to enable prosecution to decide on its next line of action.
