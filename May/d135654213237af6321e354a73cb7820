As Kano State government launched a fresh probe into the expenses of the Kano Emirate Council from 2013 to 2019, Emir Mohammed Sanusi, many believe, might, again, be the target.
The Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, according to a letter dated May 2, and signed by the commission’s head of operations, Suleiman Gusau, initiated the probe.
The commission invited certain staff of the council for an alleged violation of section 26 of its law in the management of the emirate’s funds.
Amongst officials expected to honour the invitation are Mohammad Kwaru (accountant of the council); Mannir Sanusi (chief of staff to the emir); Isa Sanusi (former principal private secretary and half-brother to the emir) and Mujittaba Falakin Kano (private secretary to the emir).
They will be reckoning for spending from 2013 to 2019.
According to the letter, the probe derives its authority form the power conferred on the government under “Section 9 and 15 of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-corruption Commission Law 2008 (as amended).”
The first attempt at probing the emirate was initiated by the state legislative of the APC state—and that was about the tie Emir Sanusi was hitting the APC-led federal government for its inefficiency in handling the economy.
During the forex crisis that greeted the administration’s first term, Sanusi, an ex-governor of the CBN, once revealed how many bureau-de-change operators fronting for those in the corridor of power are making billions from forex trading without doing anything.
