Nasarawa United have protested to the LMC that forward Sunusi Ibrahim scored 10 goals in the regular NPFL season and as such should be tied with Mfon Udoh as Goal King of the season, National Daily gathered.

The LMC has thus shifted announcement of the top scorer award till the Super 6 in Lagos next month as they plan to double check their records.

Tasiu Lawal of Katsina United scored nine goals.
