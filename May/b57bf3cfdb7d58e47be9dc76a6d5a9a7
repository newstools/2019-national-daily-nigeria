Fashion enthusiast came together recently to celebrate the launch of the Abioye Spring/Summer collection by House of Irawo. This took place at their store Ocean Bay Mall, 24 Idejo Street, off Adeola Odeku, VI.



Culturally inspired by the West African heritage and values; the collection showcased woman in the light of royalty, glory and elegance.



The collection Abioye speaks volume as it reminds every woman of her invisible crown.



You will admire a woman in Abioye, by the spirals and ruffles that follow through every piece in the collection; as they connote the curves and sensual yet authoritarian strides with which the woman moves; the ways she flows while she walks, the way she holds her head high; never forgetting where she is from. Never forgetting her place as a priced jewel, an esteemed piece to be adorned and revered.



The Abioye collection embodies women as elegant, strong, daring, vibrant and boundless.
