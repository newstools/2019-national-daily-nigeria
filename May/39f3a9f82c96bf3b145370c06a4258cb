The United |Kingdom (UK) has raised security alert of planned attack on Nigeria by a fundamentalist Muslim group, the Islamic State (IS).
The UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Jeremy Hunt, on Wednesday had cautioned against an impending attack on Nigeria by Islamic State (IS), adding that the rise of the group needed to be “nipped in the bud.”
Hunt was said to have identified the zone around the north east, Nigeria, as an “outpost of Daesh (Islamic State).” He admonished that the violence could “escalate quickly and… get out of control”, the Press Association (PA) news agency reports.
BBC reported that Hunt made the comments when visiting the regional city of Maiduguri, Borno State, as part of his five-nation tour of the continent.

The foreign secretary also pledged to help tackle climate change, saying that could help prevent the escalation of the conflict.
He is due to travel on to Ethiopia and Kenya.
