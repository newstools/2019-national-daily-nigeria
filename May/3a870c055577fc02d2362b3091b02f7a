A former governor of Abia State and Senator-elect, Orji Kalu, has said he is optimistic that Nigerians will fare better in Buhari’s next four years leadership of the country.
Kalu, who will be representing Abia North in the 9th National Assembly, has therefore called on Nigerians not to relent in their support for the Buhari-led government.
In a statement on Tuesday through his Special Adviser, Mr. Kunle Oyewunmi, he said, “As Nigeria records another feat with the swearing in of President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in office as Nigeria’s President, I am optimistic that this historic milestone will translate into a better life for Nigerians”.
The governor also called on the incoming governors to know that the elections are over and get ready for “serious governance.”
He added, “The political class must live up to expectations at all levels of government. Nigerians deserve a quality life and as such policies and programmes that will have meaningful impacts on the society must be formulated and executed.
“The time is now for politicians and other stakeholders to work harmoniously to build a decent society. Let us forget our political, ethnic and religious differences for the sake of nation building”.
According to Kalu, Nigerians should be steadfast, law-abiding and patriotic.
Kalu is among members of the opposition, who upon defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), seems to have had corruption allegations levelled against them treated with levity.
