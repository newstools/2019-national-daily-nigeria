The Abia State Commissioner of Police, Ene Okon, in an interview on Channels Television, monitored from Lagos by National Daily, had declared that anyone or group of persons associated with IPOB will be termed as a terrorist and dealt with severely.
“The Nigeria Police Force in Abia will treat any person associated with IPOB as a terrorist and such a person or group of persons will be dealt with according to the law,” the CP had declared.
The CP warned those behind the sit-at-home-order issued by IPOB, effective May 30, 2019. He told the people to disregard the order, assuring that adequate security will be provided to protect citizens.
“I am assuring the good people of Abia to disregard the illegal order and go about their normal businesses as there is every assurance of protection of lives and properties,” the CP said.
