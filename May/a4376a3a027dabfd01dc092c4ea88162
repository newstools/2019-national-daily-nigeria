“This could be an early warning sign that fraudsters are shifting focus to mobile attacks and testing the waters in different types of mobile and online banking fraud in 2019.

“The truth is that you do not need to go to a bank’s branch to carry out a transaction. Most people are carrying their cards in their phones. The money is not on the phone but is a channel through which you can assess your bank account and the money in it.

“It is because the attention of the cyber attackers has moved to the mobile platforms. They are one of us, so they know where the interest is going. One of the things we are doing is to create awareness for both the users and the operators so that they can tighten the security around the mobile device.”

Fraudulent activities carried out through internet banking declined from N143, 144 million in 2017 to N92, 770 million.
