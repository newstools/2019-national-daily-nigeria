President Muhammadu Buhari has declared his assets after his first tenure in office in preparation for his second term inauguration which holds on Wednesday, May 29. Accordingly, the president has complied with the constitution which required him to declare his assets on assumption of office and the end of the tenure; President Buhari, therefore, submitted his assets declaration forms to the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), before his oath-taking for second term on May 29th.

However, National Daily learned that the 2019 assets declaration of the president is not remarkably different from what he declared in 2015. This is, however, coming after the President had earned salaries and various forms of allowances, including other perquisites of office in the past four years, which ought to have added to his accumulated wealth.

The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Household and Domestic Affairs, Sarki Abba, was said to have submitted the duly completed forms to the Chairman of the CCB, Professor Mohammed Isa, on behalf of President Buhari.
It was highlighted that the forms signed by the President and sworn to before a Judge of Abuja High Court, showed no significant changes in assets acquisition as the President declared in 2015.
There are no new houses, no new bank accounts at home and abroad and there are no new shares acquired. Thus, President Buhari made conservative assets declaration before his inauguration this Wednesday.
The Chairman of the CCB commended the President for leading by example in declaring his assets in accordance with the law.
