The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has re-arraigned the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, Yemi Akinwonmi and two INEC officials for alleged N179.8 million fraud.

The two INEC officials whose names were given as Dickson Atiba and Ogunmodede were dragged before a Federal High Court sitting Lagos on Monday.

EFCC first arraigned them before Justice Muslim Hassan last July 30. They were accused of conspiring to take possession of the money in March 2015 ahead of the general elections.

According to the commission, they handled the cash without going through a financial institution, thereby violating the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011.

The case was re-assigned to Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke, who withdrew after trial had begun following an application by the defence. It was again re-assigned to Justice Chuka Obiozor, hence the re-arraignment.

The prosecution said the defendants received the money from Adeyinka Ayo-Aina when they “reasonably ought to have known that the money formed part of proceeds of fraud.”

It also said Akinwonmi, a former INEC staff, and Atiba, on or about April 7, 2015, made and accepted a cash payment of N69million.

Akinwonmi, Atiba and Oladayo pleaded not guilty to the eight-count charge filed by prosecuting Counsel Rotimi Oyedepo.

Justice Obiozor adjourned until May 27 for trial.
