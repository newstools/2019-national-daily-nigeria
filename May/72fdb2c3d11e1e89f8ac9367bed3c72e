The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, in its judgment on Thursday on an appeal filed by Senator Ademola Adeleke, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Osun State governorship election, upholds his eligibility to contest governorship election.
A High Court in Abuja had in April nullified the candidature of Adeleke over certificate scandal.
In spite of the fact that the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) had confirmed that Adeleke sat for its examination in 1981, the presiding judge, Othman Musa, still held that the result Adeleke attached to his form CF001 which he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was fake.

The judge had argued that while the court’s findings showed that Adeleke entered secondary school in 1976, there was no record to show that he actually graduated as his name was no longer seen in the school’s register from 1980.
National Daily learned that Nathaniel Oke, counsel to Adeleke, had protested that it was unfair that the judge ignored the evidence tendered by WAEC.
Adeleke appealed the judgment of the High Court in Abuja, and the Appeal Court on Thursday cleared the Senator from the certificate scandal.
