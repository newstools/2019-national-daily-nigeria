A doctor has confessed to murdering and dismembering a woman he dated when he discovered she was transsexual.
Mikhail Tikhonov, 27, roast parts of the flesh in an oven and flushed the remains down the toilet.
The culprit had been on a night out with Nina Surgutskaya, 25, in Kursk, Russia, before going back to her flat. They were having sex when he realised that she was ‘transsexual’ and had undergone surgery.
Tikhonov immediately strangled her before dismembering the body to hide the crime, according to Daily Mail UK.
The 27-year-old was detained and questioned after the lady went missing and her mother called in police to investigate.
According to the police, Nina invited him to her flat where they continued to drink alcohol and began to have sex. He noticed his partner had been previously a man.
“She tried to continue the sex but at that moment he grabbed her by neck and squeezed tight.
“He stopped only when she had no more signs of life.”
Tikhonov then ‘decided to get rid of the body’ and took the corpse to the bathroom where he ‘cut out her internal organs’ and chopped them into small pieces which he flushed down the toilet.
He chopped the woman’s flesh, and ‘put into the oven’, roasting them ‘to evaporate excess liquid’.
He then put the head and limbs into a suitcase and took them to his flat, according to the crime report.
Tikhonov faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted of murder and mutilating the corpse.
