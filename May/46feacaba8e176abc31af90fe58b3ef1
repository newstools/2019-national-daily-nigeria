A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) who is standing trial over an alleged N450m fraud, Dele Belgore has revealed that he gave the sum of N10million to the former Kwara state Commissioner of Police shortly before the 2015 presidential election.

While being cross examined at a Lagos Federal High Court on Monday, Belgore, admitted that the money was given to the commissioner of police.

Belgore is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) who had been slammed with a 9-count charge alongside a former Minister of Planning, Professor Abubakar Sulaiman.

At the court proceedings on Monday, Belgore who was the campaign coordinator of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Kwara State acknowledged delivering N10 million to Commissioner of Police, Garba Salihu on March 27, 2015.

The defendant had earlier denied the allegation in his defence but admitted under cross-examination by the prosecutor, Rotimi Oyedepo.

He said the N10 million delivered to the police commissioner was part of the N450 million he was said to have collected from a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke.

Belgore while denying the nine-count charges against him, said he had never met Alison Madueke in his life, adding that he was not aware that the N450m was from her.

“I delivered N10 million to the then Kwara State Commissioner of Police, Garba Salihu on March 27, 2015. And the money was part of N450 million sent to Kwara State.

He however said “I went to the bank on the 26th of March; the election was on the 28th of March, 2015. It was humanly impossible for the two of us (himself and Suleiman) to have successfully distributed the money across the state in two days”.
