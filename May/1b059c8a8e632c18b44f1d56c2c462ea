West Ham star Felipe Anderson is among the creative influences being considered by Liverpool, claims the Daily Mail. The Reds are expected to move for another playmaker this summer, and it could be that they launch a raid on a Premier League rival.
Romelu Lukaku is not the only player Antonio Conte will have his eye on if the former Chelsea boss takes the reins at Inter, claims Sky Sports. The Italian is also said to be keen on taking Victor Moses to San Siro, having previously worked with the Nigeria international at Stamford Bridge.
Manchester United will promote back-up goalkeeper Sergio Romero to first choice if David de Gea leaves the club, claims the Mail. De Gea’s contract talks have stalled with the Spain international demanding wages of £350,000 per week, leaving him with just one year left on his deal.  And Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reportedly ready to put his faith in Argentine Romero if the club decides to cash in on De Gea this summer.
