The birth of a royal baby boy to Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has changed the line of succession. The baby’s name has not been released yet but here are the first 10 people in line for the throne:
1. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales
2. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge
3. Prince George of Cambridge
4. Princess Charlotte of Cambridge
5. Prince Louis of Cambridge
6. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex
7. Baby boy of Prince Harry and Meghan
8. Prince Andrew, Duke of York
9. Princess Beatrice of York
10. Princess Eugenie of York
Harry’s baby won’t turn a prince automatically. It’s really up to the queen to decide, although Harry and Meghan may also have a say.
A decree issued by King George V in 1917 limits the number of grand royal titles in a way that would make Harry and Meghan’s son known as a “Lord” rather than as a prince. He wouldn’t become “his royal highness” under the current rules.
The queen has the authority, however, to intervene as she did when William and his wife Kate started having children. The queen decreed that all of their children would be princes and princesses.
She could do the same for Harry and Meghan’s offspring, but the queen’s feelings on that subject haven’t been made public. She did not make any immediate announcement after the baby’s birth.
It is also possible that Harry and Meghan could decide they don’t want the special designation for the baby, in order to give their child a more normal upbringing.
