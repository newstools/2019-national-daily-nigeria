The newly elected Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has made a post-election promise to pay ₦100,000 monthly salary, N70,000 higher than the National Minimum Wage, to graduates who he intends to employ as BRT drivers in the state.
National Dailylearned that Sanwo-Olu at an interactive session with his classmates at the Executive Master of Business Administration class, University of Lagos, 1998/2000, at the weekend, was of the view that recruiting educated and responsible people would instill discipline and end the recklessness of BRT bus drivers.

“The BRT issue is something that has to do with culture. When we take over, by the Grace of God, we will advertise and see if we can employ some of our graduates as drivers.
“What I realised is that apart from the money we will be paying them, which is more than what they are paying an average graduate, we need to very quickly tell our people and encourage ourselves that there is dignity in work. We are going to be paying (them) between N80,000 and N100,000 to come and drive these buses because we expect a lot more decency.
 “By the time we get the culture of the drivers’ right, the routes are coming up, by the time we finish the Abule-Egba/Iyana Ipaja/Ikeja route, it will boost the number of BRT (buses),” Sanwo-Olu had declared.
