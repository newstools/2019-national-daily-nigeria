The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) may have initiated another fresh charges against outgoing Senate President Bukola Saraki, National Daily has learnt.

In a fresh letter by the EFCC in which it claimed it was probing an alleged case of conspiracy, abuse of office, misappropriation of public funds, theft, and money laundering involving Saraki, suggests that the current administration is not yet done with its effort to nail the former Kwara State governor.

According to the anti-graft agency, its fresh investigation seeks to look into all salaries, allowances, estacodes, and payments Saraki received as governor from 2003 to 2011.

The EFCC notice disclosing its moves against Saraki was contained in a letter to the state government, through the Permanent Secretary, Government House, dated April 26, and entitled, ‘Investigation Activities: Dr. Bukola Saraki.’

The move came few days after the International Human Rights Commission (IHRC) announced the appointment of Saraki, as its “Ambassador-at-Large”.

The letter signed by EFCC Zonal Head, Isyaku Sharu, read in part, “In view of the above, you are kindly requested to furnish us with the full details of all his entitlements to include but not limited to emoluments, allowances, estacodes, other fringe benefits and severance package while he held sway as the Executive Governor of Kwara State between 2003 and 2011.

“This request is made pursuant to Section 38 (1) & (2) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004 and Section 21 of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act.”

Recall that Saraki had soon after emerging the 8th National Assembly Senate President suffered different prosecutions under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government. He, however, came out unhurt in all of them.
