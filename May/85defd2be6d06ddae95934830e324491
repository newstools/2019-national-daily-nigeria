Mesut Ozil does not “have it in him to be a leader”, says Cesc Fabregas, with a former Arsenal star suggesting that one in the present team requires someone like Cristiano Ronaldo alongside him in order to thrive.
A move to England was intended to make him a talisman in his own right, but the World Cup winner has struggled to become a go-to man for the Gunners.
His inability to dictate proceedings was highlighted once again during a forgettable showing from both him and those around him in the Europa League final on Wednesday.
Arsenal slumped to a 4-1 defeat at the hands of domestic rivals Chelsea in a European showpiece, with Fabregas among those to question Ozil’s input on a game which raised familiar questions.
“I’m not taking anything away from Mesut, he played top football there, but once you step down a little bit, because we can all agree Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich they are top three, you have to show yourself a little bit more because you don’t have the same quality around you.
