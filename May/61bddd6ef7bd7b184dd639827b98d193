…Court Orders Arrest of Sanusi’s Chief of Staff, other Palace Aides
The plots against His Highness, Muhammad Sanusi II, Emir of Kano, have been intensified by the Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Umar Ganduje. The Emir has been placed under investigation since the royal throne was converted to partisan politicking and patronage arena by the Kano governor.
National Daily gathered that a Magistrate Court in Kano State on Tuesday ordered the arrest of Munir Bayero, Chief of Staff to Muhammadu Sanusi, Emir of Kano.
The court also gave an order for the arrest of Mujitaba Abba and Sani Kwaru who are also aides of the royal father.
It was explained that Magistrate Muhammad Idris issued the order in endorsing a request by the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti- Corruption Commission which was said to be probing alleged misappropriation of funds belonging to the Kano Emirate Council.

National Daily also gathered that Muhuyi Gado, Chairman of the anti-graft agency, wrote a letter on Tuesday, to Ahmed Iliyasu, Commissioner of Police in Kano, requesting the reinforcement of security personnel ahead of the arrest of the Palace Aides in complaint with the court order.
The commission was said to have acknowledged in the letter that with the powers vested on it under the provision of section 38 of its establishment act, it is empowered to investigate the “misappropriation” at the Palace.
The investigation was a followup tyo the controversial creation of new emirates in Kano and appointment of new Emirs by Governor Ganduje. However, the court nullified the new emirates.
There are fears that the chances that Emir Sanusi will get justice in the investigation is very remote. Governor Ganduje may be on his way to dethrone the Kano Emir.
