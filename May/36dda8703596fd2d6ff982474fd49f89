President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday warned the Code of Conduct Bureau to keep his asset declaration forms very well because of his his enemies.
The CCB presented the forms to him, and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the presidential villa in Abuja.
Buhari said a lot of people who have “tested the bitter pill” of his anti-corruption war will seek to fight back by 2023 when his second term will end.
“So, please, make sure you keep it safely because there are people who believe they shouldn’t be questioned and some of them are already in trouble. I expect them to fight back and this is one of the instruments,” said the president.
He also commended Muhammad Isa, CCB chairman, for accepting to serve.
“I think we cannot over emphasise the importance of your office because Nigerians are notorious for cutting short and not giving account of their public responsibilities and we are trying to impress it on our nation and the world that this administration is based on accountability.
“It is only institutions like yours that will bail us out from the efforts that we have been making to make sure that people in public offices do not abuse that public office and that those who come in and those that are leaving in certain positions make sure that they hold the integrity of the office and of the country generally in high esteem.”
Isah was accompanied by Murtala Kankia, Emmanuel Attah and other board members
