The presiding Judge of the Federal High Court, Minna, Niger State, Justice A B Aliyu, on Thursday, revoked the bail granted the former Governor of Niger State, Aliyu Babangida, and the former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Alhaji Umar Gado Nasko, for abuse of the bail conditions.
National Daily learned that the judge was furious over the absence of former Governor Aliyu and Nasir Nasko in court, in spite of issuance of hearing notice, and accordingly, issued a bench warrant against the two persons standing trial over N2 billion money laundering allegations for disrespecting the court.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been prosecuting Babangida Aliyu and Nasko over allegations of N2 billion money laundering and other financial crimes.
National Daily also learned that the accused persons were formerly arraigned before Justice Bogoro Yelin where they pleaded not guilty to the alleged offence.
However, Justice Yelin had been transferred to another court while he is part of the judges handling cases at the Elections Petitions Tribunals.
The case was re-assigned to Justice Aliyu now handling the suit de novo (afresh) while the hearing notices were issued to the parties over the fresh arraignment of Babangida Aliyu and Nasko.
National Daily learned that when the matter came up on Thursday, none of the accused persons was present in court just as their lawyers were absent.
Lawyer to one of the accused persons, Osuman Mamma (SAN), was said to have written to the court that he was before an election petitions tribunal. Though, he did send a lawyer to represent him in court.
The presiding Judge furiously revoked their bail and issued warrant of arrest against the accused persons. The judge, thereafter, adjourned the case to May 27, 2019.
