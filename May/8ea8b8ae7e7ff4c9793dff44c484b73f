Akwa United  goal stopper Ojo Olorunleke says  he is happy over  the winning side in his comeback game for Akwa United at Go-Round FC.
Akwa United pipped Go Round FC 1-0 Wednesday to consolidate their leadership in Group B.
The 2017 Aiteo Cup Champion was in between the sticks during match day 18 fixture between Akwa United and Go Round FC in Omoku which ended one goal to nothing in favour of the promise keepers.
Its my comeback game after i lost the No 1 shirt for several weeks on the back of a highly-publicised mistake Olorunleke explained.
“I am happy I posted a clean sheet and we also won maximum points at Go Round,” the former Nigeria U20 shot stopper told National Daily.
Olorunleke produced a man-of-the-match performance that earned his team maximum points with his fantastic saves in Omoku.
