A former Niger Delta militant leader, Asari Dokubo, has said he would not hesitate to kill the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, should he dare him.

Dokubo made the vow in a video he shared on Facebook on Wednesday morning, insisting that the struggle for the actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra has been compromised by the IPOB leader.

The former militant leader, who had earlier accused Kanu of being behind the recent murder of an Enugu State prophet, Anthony Nwoko, who had always made prophesies on issues of Biafra, alleged that the IPOB leader would turn the Biafra struggle into bloodshed.

He said, “Our fellow Biafrans, in this period of darkness, a few people have decided to thrash our struggle in the blood of our own people. So that they will become Supreme leaders, saviours and messiahs.

“We didn’t see the red flag, the signals were always there but some people saw it before us. But because we believed that Biafra must be achieved with any means possible, we did not see these dangerous signals early enough.”

Insisting that Kanu masterminded the assassination Prophet Nwoko, Asari said would do everything to kill Nnamdi Kanu should he dare him.

“I’ll smoke you out. I’m not boasting. I’ll smoke you out from every hole, every corner. They know me. If one idiot threatens to attack me and makes good his words to attack me, I’ll kill him,” he boasted.
