The National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the Joint Admission Matriculation Board, JAMB, to refund N50 Short Message Service, SMS, charges back to UTME candidates.
 
NANS made this demand while accusing JAMB of exploiting Nigerian students through the SMS charge of N50 to get their results.
 
In a statement by its national Senate President, Comrade Abdulmajeed Oladimeji Oyeniyi, NANS called on the board to send the examination results directly to candidates’ phone since it has their database.
 
NANS warned that the board would face the wrath of students nationwide if the money was not refunded in 48 hours.

According to Oyeniyi: “We are never an accident of history; we are part and parcel of the struggle so far. The Nigerian students no longer have confidence in the board’s leadership and decision making.
 
“In a sane community, Computer Based Test (CBT) should be well planned before execution to cater for the purposes it was invented for.
 
“The sanity in the system should ensure appropriate immediate release of results of examinations done by students but it was unfortunate that the board took almost a month to release results across the nation with unprofessional, unethical, non-ideological and non-technological excuses which is nothing but a disgrace to us as giant of Africa.”
