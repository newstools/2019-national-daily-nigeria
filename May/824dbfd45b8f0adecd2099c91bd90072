While Kaduna Gov Nasir el-Rufai has been waxing lyrical about how to defeat Lagos politics godfather Ahmed Tinubu, he too might be losing his grip on Kaduna APC federal lawmakers.
All the APC federal reps in the state are supporting Majority Leader Femi Gbajabiamila, a candidate of Tinubu, who is perceived to be nursing a 2023 agenda like el-Rufai.
The lawmakers are even working hard to recruit the three PDP in the run-up to the June 10 election in the lower chamber.
In a statement signed by nine of the 12 members-elect and read to newsmen by Rep. Tajudeen Abass at the end of their caucus meeting, the incoming legislators also pledged support for Rep Ahmed Wase (APC-Plateau) for Deputy Speaker of the Lower chamber.
“The meeting was a huge success as all the members-elect not only reiterated their unflinching support for the project but also tried to convince other four members-elect of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to join the APC. 9th Assembly
“The caucus meeting was chaired by a 4th term member of the house, Rep. Garba Datti Mohammad,” the statement quoted the Rep. members-elect as saying.
The ruling party has zone the chamber’s topmost position to the southwest, and Gbajabiamila, from Lagos, is the party’s choice.
The fifth timer is currently the Majority Leader of the house, while Wase is the current Deputy Majority Leader.
Other contenders for the office of speaker include; Rep. Nkiruka Onyejeocha (APC-Abia) Rep. John Dyegh (APC-Benue) Rep. Umaru Bago (APC-Niger) Rep. Abdulrazak Namdas (APC-Adamawa) among others.
Some campaign against Tinubu has kick-started in Kaduna, as el-Rufai himself takes the war across Nigeria, especially Lagos where he recently delivered a speech indicting godfatherism in Lagos
