The Federal Government says it has plans to review the privatization process of the power sector over the poor performances of the Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) since 2013

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo disclosed this while addressing workers’ at the workers’ day celebration in Abuja.

Representing President Muhammadu Buhari at the event which held at the Eagle Square, Osinbajo said the relevant companies had been unable to provide effective power supply to meet domestic and industrial needs of Nigerians.

He added that this had become a major concern to the government, hence, the need to reposition the sector.

He said: “Today, that sector, after it was privatised, still remains stalled in delivering power to many Nigerian homes and businesses.

“We must act as a matter of national importance and we are committed to doing so, to work and re-engineer the sector for much more effective performance. Workers shall be called upon to play a greater role in supporting the government to attain all these goals.”

While reinstating the commitment of the government to workers welfare, the Vice President cautioned workers on using industrial action as a tool to always drive home their grievances.

He lamented the loss Nigeria’s economy suffers when the workers declare strike.

The vice president said: “Industrial peace is central to economic stability. Every industrial disruption cost the national economy very dearly in terms of money and manpower that are lost.

“It is for this reason that I urged all actors in the industrial relations system to be circumspect and ethical in the use of industrial action as tools for resolving work place crisis. Industrial actions, because of the huge economic and social cost, should be the last and not the first option for resolving disputes.”
