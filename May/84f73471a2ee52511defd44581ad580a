Nigerian singer Davido has responded to a social media user who accused him of supporting fraud following his tweet directed at Governor Gboyega Oyetola. Recall that Legit.ng earlier reported that the super star singer took to the micro blogging platform with a cry for the incumbent governor to accept defeat and vacate office for his uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke.
In the post, he described the continued stay of the governor as ‘embarrassing and ridiculous’. His choice of words, however, caught the attention of a user on the platform, who fired back at the singer.
According to the Twitter user identified as Macfillan, the singer supports fraud and as such does not have the high moral ground to come after the governor. “You support fraud; you have no moral high ground to talk about what is ridiculous or embarrassing.” he said.
