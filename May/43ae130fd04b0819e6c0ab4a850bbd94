The Anambra State House of Assembly has outlawed marriages involving people living with sickle cell anaemia, a law that might not go well with those who believe in miracles.
The bill was sponsored by the member representing Anaocha II state constituency, Charles Ezeani and 15 others.
To be cited as Sickle Cell Disease Control and Eradication Repeal, the law seeks eradicate sickle cell anaemia in Anambra State and set those living with it free from all kinds of oppression, abuse and exploitation.
The law compels parents, guardians or group of persons giving out their children/wards in marriage to ensure verification of a qualified sickle cell disease prevention certificate.
It also provides that no religious body or marriage registry “shall perform solemnisation of Holy Matrimony” without first demanding and obtaining a sickle cell disease prevention certificate from intending couples.”
Nigerians, many believe, take faith in the supernatural seriously, and it’s their rights to personal faith.
The law however cares less for matters of faith here.
“Anybody who contravenes the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of N200,000 or three years imprisonment or both.”
There will be a monitoring committee to ensure compliance.
The co-sponsor of the bill,  Charles Ezeani, described the law as    life-saving.
He said the development would put a stop to the notion “that love is blind” by ensuring that intending couples must present their genotype test certificate before marriage.
Ezeani commended the Speaker of the Assembly, Mrs Rita Maduagwu and other members for being the first to pass such  health enhancement bill into law in the country.
The National Coordinator of People Living with Sickle Cell Anaemia, Aisha Edwards, thanked the lawmakers for enacting a law that would protect the sickle cell patients from all forms of discrimination and marginalisation in the state.
