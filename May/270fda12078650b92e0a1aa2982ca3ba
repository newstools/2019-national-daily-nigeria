It was earlier reported that a social media user who appeared to be a loyal fan of Marley, called out PPRO Dolapo Badmus and veteran rapper Ruggedman over allegations that they were both involved in his arrest.

In a long post shared online, the aggrieved Marley fan noted that it even if it takes him days, weeks, months or years, he would make it his life’s mission to personally take the life of the two. Badmus has now reacted to the death threat after a concerned follower quizzed in the comment section of her post on Instagram.

According to her, the man is just a noise maker that is simply seeking attention. She dared him to come over to her office if he wants to live by his words. She said: “Really? He must be a noise maker seeking attention. He knows my office address let him show!”
