Less than 24 hours to the inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari for second term, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is in the storm of fresh internal war over the quality of leadership in the party. Northern APC leaders have demanded immediate resignation of the national Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.
Leading the war from the north, APC Deputy National Chairman, North, Senator Lawali Shuaibu, on Tuesday demanded the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to resign from office immediately.

The northern APC leaders are protesting the loss of Zamfara State by the APC to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the judgment of the Supreme Court.
National Daily gathered that in a letter dated May 27th, 2019, addressed to Adams Oshiomhole, Shuaibu remarked that in advanced democracies, people who fail to add value or build over and above what they met on assumption of duty, show some civilised examples, “they honourably resign.”
The six-page letter titled ‘APC: Its fortune and misfortune, time to act!’ added: “It is my honest opinion that your ability to ensure this party flourishes is deficient as you lack the necessary composure and you also don’t posses the capabilities and the requisite experience to run a political party.”
