The CPI measures the average change over time in prices of goods and services consumed by people for day-to-day living.


The construction of the CPI combines economic theory, sampling and other statistical techniques using data from other surveys to produce a weighted measure of average price changes in the Nigerian economy.


The weighting occurs to capture the importance of the selected commodities in the entire index.
