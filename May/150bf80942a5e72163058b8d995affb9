Residents of Enugu metropolis on Thursday went about their normal activities and disregarded the sit-at-home order given by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).
The outlawed group had on May 28 in a statement directed the residents to observe a sit-at-home order in memory of those who lost their lives in the Nigeria-Biafra war from 1967 to 1970.
There was no sign of compliance as the roads were busy with vehicular traffic and many people were going about their activities.
At Agbani Road axis, there was heavy traffic as many people including school children and workers were boarding commercial buses to their different destinations.
Public and private schools in the metropolis were opened for normal academic activities for the day.
Kenyatta, Garki and Akwata markets in the metropolis, as well as banks, were opened for business, while traders were busy displaying their goods as usual.
Traders said that previous sit-at-home orders by IPOB had never favoured anyone; rather people counted losses in their businesses for staying at home.
Some vowed they would be the last person to observe such an order again, describing the IPOB members as jobless people.
A Federal High Court in Abuja on September 21, 2017, gave judicial backing to the Executive Order of President Muhammadu Buhari, outlawing the IPOB and declared its activities as acts of terrorism and illegality.
