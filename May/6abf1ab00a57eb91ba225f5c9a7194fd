The Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, on Tuesday honoured the invitation by the Senate and appeared before the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly to provide information on the rising wave of violent crimes in the country, essentially, the banditry, kidnapping, and terrorism in northern Nigeria.
Ag. IGP Adamu got the invitation of the Senate on April 25, 2019.
The senators had invited the IG of Police to brief the Upper Chamber at Plenary on the security situation in the country, particularly, what the police is doing to contain the rampant kidnappings and banditry across the country.
The northern part of Nigeria has become a war zone where bandits overrun communities, steal, kill, kidnap and destroy property.
