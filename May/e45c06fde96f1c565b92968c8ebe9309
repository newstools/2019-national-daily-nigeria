Those who called President Muhammadu Buhari ‘baba go slow’ during his first administration should buckle up for the next four years. Head will roll.
Buhari said this during a media chat aired on the Nigerian Television Authority.
According to him,  he would ensure police and judicial reform in his second term in office.

“Those who call me ‘baba go slow’ will see whether I am slow or fast.”

Clarifying that,  he said, “It means I will persuade the police and the judiciary to be hard and where I uncover that they are not hard, I will find out who is responsible for the slowness in terms of command from the DPO upwards.

“The IG cannot do it alone; he needs to depend on commissioners who in turn depend on DPOs.”
