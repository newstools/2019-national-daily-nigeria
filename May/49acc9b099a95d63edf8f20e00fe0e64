The Republic of Iran has dared the United States in a manner that could provoke further actions by US. Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, was said to have insisted on Wednesday that Tehran will continue to sell its oil in the international market despite U.S. sanctions and rest5ricitons on the country in the Arab World. He vowed that Washington’s policy of putting pressure on Iran would fail in practice.
Rouhani called the U.S. decision to try to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero a “baseless” policy. He remarked that “the Americans’ power is not as much as they say.”
The United States demanded on April 22 that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, ending six months of waivers that had allowed Iran’s eight biggest customers, most of them in Asia, to import limited volumes.
Iran and the US have been at loggerhead over the development of nuclear capacity or nuclear armament by the Iranian authorities. Iran has continued to resist US threats and sanctions over the years.  Iran is perceived as an emerging superpower in the gulf in the character of North Korea who the US has been battling to contain and frustrate the development of nuclear capability by the Middle East country.
