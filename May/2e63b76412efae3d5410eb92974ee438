Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has revoked the operating licences of Mercov Securities Limited, Resano Securities Limited and Transafrica Financial Services Limited.
With this, the three affected companies are no longer allowed to deal with the trading of stocks in the country.
A circular dated May 17, 2019 and signed by Mr Olufemi Shobanjo, head of Broker Dealer Regulation at the NSE, explained that the three companies failed to “comply with the requirements of the Minimum Operation Standards of The Exchange.”
As a result, the National Council of the Exchange on January 31, 2019, approved the “expulsion and revocation” of the licences of the dealing member companies.
