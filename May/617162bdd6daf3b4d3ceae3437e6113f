A new innovation in the history of Nigeria football league will be deployed to power live games in 2019 Nationwide League One (NLO) season through the application of MYCUJOO App on phones, tablets and laptops on the platform of Deebeetee Projects Limited, an indigenous ICT firm in Abuja.

The partnership deal was signed between the board of NLO and the team of Deebeetee Projects few weeks ago during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the third tier league in Nigeria.

Everything has been perfected to run the live streaming of games beginning with the star match on match day one of the 2019 season between Oyah Sports and FC Solid of Plateau at Anwal Ibrahim stadium, Suleja this Thursday.

Mohammed Alkali, the Independent Chairman of the league told National Daily that live streaming of league games in NLO is a welcome development that will help to improve the quality of football in the NLO and also help to project the young talents to global audience.

“It is a welcome development that NLO games will be shown to the world through live streaming of the league games. We have very good players in the league and having their games on live streaming will definately help to improve the quality of games in the league and the players will have the opportunity of being watched around the world.” Alkali said.

“It is a win-win situation for football stakeholders in the NLO, NFF and our partners in this noble project. We are particularly grateful to the leadership of the platform for their kind support towards the growth of the game in NLO, which is the cradle of football in Nigeria,” he added.

2019 NLO match day one fixtures will be played across all league venues this Thursday.
