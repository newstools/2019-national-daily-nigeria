In the event President Muhammadu Buhari appoints former minority leader Godswill Akpabio, there might be a fresh round of crisis in the APC, especially the Akwa Ibom chapter where the formr governor defected to the ruling party last year.
The National Daily gathered that some elders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom are protesting already, two days to Buhari’s inauguration for a second term.
Speaking under the aegis of Ibom Integrity & Servant Leadership Culture Initiative, the elders in a letter to President Buhari, argued that appointing Akpabio would be an invitation to crisis in the state.
They believe Akpabio is not a genuine APC member.
In a letter entitled Ministerial Appointment: Why Appointing Akpabio May be Counter Productive, the elders argued that the state is peopled with men of integrity who fit into ministerial positions to help actualise the APC-led government’s next level agenda.
“APC’s poor outing in Akwa Ibom in the last general election was, to a large extent, due Akpabio’s destabilising and authoritarian tendencies, as he only believes that it is either his way or nobody’s.
“Akpabio’s actions left many party members bruised, trampled and disgruntled, which affected the chances of our governorship candidate, Obong Nsima Ekere at the polls,” they stated.
The letter was signed by the group’s Executive Vice President, Dr. Asuquo Edidem Etim, a copy of which was sent to APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomole, Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha and Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari.
Akpabio suddenly bolted out of his PDP last year, and joined the ruling APC which gave a ticket contest the Senate election for the second term.
He, however, lost.
And many have speculated Buhari might compensate him by appointing the former senator into his cabinet.
