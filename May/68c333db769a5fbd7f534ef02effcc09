The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has described the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as a national tragedy that has brought miseries upon Nigerians since coming to power four years ago.

The party stated this in reaction to the increase in the rate of suicide, youths’ desperation to travel abroad and other social vice since the conclusion of the 2019 presidential election.

In a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, the former ruling party charged Nigerians to “uphold and support one another in love, at this trying time to check the rising social degeneration in our nation, particularly acts of suicide.”

“It is saddening that at the time Nigerians ought to be celebrating, they are rather forlorn, committing suicide and exiting the country in droves.

“Most Nigerians have become downhearted in the face of an administration that wrecked our once robust economy and divided our people; in the face of worsening joblessness, piling bills, hunger and diseases; in the face of incompetence, lies, and unfulfilled promises of free homes, monthly allowance to unemployed youth and the poor, bringing the naira to the same value as the US Dollar, creating of 5 million new jobs, ending of insurgency in three months and myriad of other false promises.

“Instead, what our nation has witnessed is an official entrenchment and elevation of incompetence, deceit, propaganda, failure and cabal mentality on the corridors of power; a situation where the only achievement is the foisting of economic recession and mortgaging of the future of our nation with the accumulation of N24.39 trillion debt, with no tangible project to show.

“It is instructive to state that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration has obstinately refused to allow any scrutiny of its books, knowing that they are catalogues of corruption, treasury looting, violations, impunity and acts that have brought our nation to its knees.”

The PDP however called on Nigerians not to despair but “stand firm in their collective determination to retrieve the stolen Presidential mandate at the tribunal, so they can have an administration that truly cares for them and which has the competence to return our nation on her deserved path of peace, national cohesion and economic prosperity.”
