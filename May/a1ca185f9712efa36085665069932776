Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun on Thursday joined jubilating crowd, party faithful and supporters in Osogbo, to celebrate the judgment of the Court of Appeal which upheld his election in the 2018 governorship poll.
Oyetola who joined the crowd at about 12:25am, at the popular Olaiya junction, moved in his convoy through Alekuwodo street and Workers Drive.
The celebration slowed down traffic around the Olaiya junction as the jubilating crowd and the governorâ€™s convoy moved on.
Security personnel were around to ensure the procession was not hijacked by hoodlums.
The PDP has vowed to appeal the judgment.
March 22, the Election Tribunal in Abuja overturned the election victory of Gov. Oyetola and declared Sen. Ademola Adeleke as the winner of the Osun Sept. 22, 2018 governorship election.
Oyetola and his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), then approached the Appellate Court, which today upheld his victory and overturned the ruling of the Tribunal.
