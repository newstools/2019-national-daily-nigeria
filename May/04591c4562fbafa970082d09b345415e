The Nigeria Police have placed their officers on red alert over plots of violent disruption of the inauguration of the new government that emerged from the 2019 general elections on May 29, 2019.
The Ogun State Police Command in a statement by the Police Public Relations, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in Abeokuta,  on Tuesday raised alarm over the intelligence report that some individuals plan to instigate violence to disrupt the May 29 inauguration of the newly elected governor in the state.
National Daily learned that the PPRO noted that rallies, processions, and assemblies in public places instigated by the enemies of peace to resolve chieftaincy and land disputes rather than approaching the Court to seek justice.
The Ogun Police Command, however, assured that adequate security measures have been put in place to contain any outburst of violence in the state during the inauguration and, thereafter.

“All of these are aimed at heating up the State before the inauguration.
“In view of this, the Command has put in place a robust security arrangement aimed at checkmating such trouble makers and other criminally-minded persons, including miscreants and disgruntled elements.
“The special units of the Command namely SARS, PMF, STS, anti-kidnapping as well as DPOs and Area Commanders have been placed on red alert with specific instruction to closely monitor these misguided elements and respond swiftly to any distress calls and disturbance of public peace,” Oyeyemi declared.
The PPRO maintained that the Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, has ordered 24-hour surveillance patrols across Ogun State.
