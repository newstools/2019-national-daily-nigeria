Youths in Lagos under the aegis of Yoruba Youth Assembly has demanded for an indigene as the head of the Lagos state assembly since the governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his Deputy, Dr. Femi Hamzat are not of Lagos state origin.

In a statement released by the publicity secretary of the group, Ola Gold, it expressed its concerned with the unfolding political antithesis in the state which has degenerated to indigene elimination in top political hierarchy which must be handle with the best of statesmanship kits.

The group which is coalition of pan Yoruba social cultural organization in Lagos state said the call for an indigenous speaker is a call for equal justice since the governor-elect and his deputy are non-indigene.


“The call is inevitable as both the Governor and deputy Governor elects are from OGUN STATE, though, we are fully conscious of the historical truism that under a constitutional democracy irrespective of religion or tribe once you have leaved in a state for more than ten years you are eligible to claim indigineship of such state but not without recourse to owners of the land and that’s why, we as an aborigin within Yoruba Youth Assembly are calling on all the stakeholders in the state and our dear party ‘APC’ to see reasons and logic in making aborigin the speaker of the State house of Assembly instead of second fiddle in our dear state.

“We have tested, trusted, capable men and women with high level of intellectual modicum to lead the nineth assembly as speaker of the parliament.

The group advocated for a more robust development and people’s participatory government in delivery good governance to the citizenry, the executive and legislative arms of government must seamlessly work in harmony as both arms are equal partners in the business of constitutional and democratic governance which the ABORIGINS have been giving Lagos government since 1999 and ready to replicate same to the coming government with our own SON as the state speaker for indegene representation.

“We are also using this opportunity to call our Royal Father’s, Opinion leaders, Religious bodies, EKO FOUNDATION, OMOEKO PATAKI, AWORI WELFARE ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (AWAN) and all other indigenous organizations to be part of the historical battle.”
