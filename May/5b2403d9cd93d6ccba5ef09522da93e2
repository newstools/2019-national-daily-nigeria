The Supreme Court on Friday affirmed the election of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.
National Daily learned that the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Mohammed, leading the five-man panel of the Supreme Court, upheld Fayemi’s victory in the July 2018 election, and unanimously held that the suit challenging the outcome of the election lacked merit.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court set aside the appeal filed against Governor Fayemi of Ekiti State by the Peoples Democratic Party and its governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Kolapo Olusola-Eleka.
The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the judgment of the Tribunal and that of the Appeal Court that upheld the election of Fayemi which the PDP and its candidate continued to challenge to the Supreme Court.

The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared that Fayemi and the All Progressives Congress secured a total of 197,459 votes to defeat Olusola-Eleka and the PDP who placed second with 178,121 votes in the July 14, 2018, governorship election.
National Daily recalls that both the Ekiti State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal and Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal had earlier dismissed the petition challenging the victory of Fayemi in the July 2018 election.
