The leaders in the communiqué signed by High Chief Aloye, Chief (Alhaji) Usman Mogaji Charlton and Ahmed Musa Momoh said any attempt by Obaseki and media team to move against Oshimhole in the state will not be tolerated.
The communiqué reads, “The meeting passed a vote of Confidence on the leadership of the national chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole. We gathered to basically react to the publication in the Nation Newspapers, which tends to portray in bad light the party primaries conducted by the Oshiomhole led NWC.
“We have no doubt that the advert was orchestrated by those in Osadebey Avenue who rose to power and suddenly forgot how they got there. We condemned that publication and urge the State Government to stop playing hide and seek game in its attempt to rubbish the legacies of Oshiomhole which we will surely resist.”
“The leaders warned those attempting to destroy the hard-earned amiable character and the reputation of the APC National Chairman to desist from such unwholesome practice.”
The communique claimed that the meeting was attended by leaders drawn from the 64 wards in Edo North senatorial district.
