Kenyan singer, Victoria Kimani has taken this ‘ you challenge’ ish to another level now as she has now directly at Tiwa Savage on Instagram.
The whole issue started after the Kenyan songstress used the buzzing ‘fvck you challenge’ by Kizz Daniel to shade Tiwa Savage and another Nigerian rapper, Ycee
In her version of the challenge, Victoria said Tiwa is 45 years and still claims she is African Bad Gyal tagging her as a grandma.
But on the other hand, Tiwa Savage didn’t give a response rather she took to social media to reveal she just got a new customized Rolls Royce.
