Out of about 10 people sheltering during a rainstorm in a Kogi town on the weekend, two were struck dead by the lightning. The community believes the gods are angry.
The ded, Wale Ayeku and Joseph lived in Odda Quarters, Ayetoro Gbedde, Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State.
According to eyewitnesses, the deceased were both having shelter in a local ‘Game-Joint’ when they met their untimely death.
“There were nine of them under a tree, where young people usually meet to play snooker when the rain started, but the thunder and lightning that accompanied the rain scared everyone.
“Not long after the rain started, we heard loud screams and wailing which compelled people to scamper for safety. In the midst of that confusion, we discovered the nine victims were struck down by the lightning, though seven others survived with injuries.”




It was gathered that the community believes there is a spiritual root cause of the tragic event, which they hope to know in seven days time according to the Sango priest.

Kogi communities have always resorted to their Ifa oracle when strange things happen.




Ifa recently told one community in the state to banish a couple whose days-old baby was abducted.
