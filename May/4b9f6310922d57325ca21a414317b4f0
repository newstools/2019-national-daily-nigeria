President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday congratulated Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on his emergence as the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF).
The President expressed delight that Dr. Fayemi’s choice was by consensus, indicating the degree of confidence reposed in him by his colleagues.
Buhari urged the new chairman to see his election as a unique opportunity to forge a deeper harmonious and fruitful working relationship not only with the Federal Government, but also with other arms and tiers of government.
Noting that the “The focal objective of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum at all times ought to be the higher interest of the people of this country above partisan, political, religious or regional differences,” President Buhari expressed the readiness of the Federal Government… to support the Forum to realise its laudable objectives.
President Buhari, while wishing Governor Fayemi a successful tenure, commended his predecessor, Governor Abdul’aziz Yari of Zamfara State for his leadership as NGF chairman.
