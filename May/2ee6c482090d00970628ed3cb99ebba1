Outgoing senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, on Sunday agreed that there are issues of nepotism under Buhari’s administration just like in previous administrations.

He also said that there is no such thing as ‘Fulanization’, an agenda orchestrated to have the Fulanis dominate over the African continent.

The senator stated this in a tweet on his official Twitter handle on Sunday, apparently in response to the Saturday Boko Haram and herdsmen comment by former President Olusegun Obasanjo.

Obasanjo was said to have at a church event in Delta State on Saturday claimed that the twin evils of Boko Haram and killer herdsmen were “no longer an issue of lack of education and lack of employment for our youth in Nigeria which it began as” but now a “West African Fulanization, Islamization and global organised crimes of human trafficking, money laundering, drug trafficking, gun trafficking, illegal mining and regime change.”

But Senator Sani wrote: “It’s true that the insurgents have a theocratic agenda, but it’s a mirage. It’s not true that the President is supporting the insurgents to achieve that. There is also nothing like ‘Fulanization’. But nepotism is a reality, like other previous administrations.”
