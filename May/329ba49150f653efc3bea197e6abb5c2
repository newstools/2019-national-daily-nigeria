“The Supreme Court ruled that the APC did not hold valid party primaries as required by law. It held that all the votes scored by the APC in the said elections are wasted votes and declared that the candidates of political parties with the second highest valid votes and the requisite spread should be declared as having been elected.

“The commission will meet again tomorrow Saturday 25th May 2019 to further deliberate on the issues arising from the said judgment, while the final decision on the matter will be communicated to the public on Monday 27 May 2019,” Okoye said.

Justice Paul Galinji, delivering the lead judgment in Abuja, held that the APC and all its candidates that participated in the elections gate-crashed, having not conducted lawful primaries and that INEC was right not have recognised the participation of APC in those elections.

He also ruled that all the political parties whose candidates scored the second highest votes in the elections and the required spread, should be declared winners forthwith, stating that the APC votes were ‘wasted votes’.
