On Tuesday, users were urged to upgrade to the latest version of the popular messaging app following a report that users could be vulnerable to having malicious spyware installed on phones without their knowledge.
“WhatsApp encourages people to upgrade to the latest version of its app, as well as keep their mobile operating system up to date.
“The upgrade will protect app against potential targeted exploits designed to compromise information stored on mobile devices,” a spokesman said.
“We are constantly working alongside industry partners to provide the latest security enhancements to help protect our users.”
It was reported that vulnerability in WhatsApp allowed attackers to inject spyware on phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.
It said the spyware was developed by Israeli cyber surveillance company NSO Group.
When asked about the report, NSO said its technology was licensed in order to authorised government agencies “for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror,” and that it does not operate the system itself.

“We investigate any credible allegations of misuse and if necessary, we take action, including shutting down the system.
Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies,” the company said.
“NSO would not or could not use its technology in its own right to target any person or organisation, including
this individual.”
