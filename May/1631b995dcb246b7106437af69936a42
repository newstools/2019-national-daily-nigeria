The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Nigeria should work to keep inflation down and also grow non-oil revenue if the economy must perform optimally.
This is even as the federal government said it had spent about N4.5trn on productive sector of the economy for the purpose of massive job creation; reduce insecurity and infrastructure development.
The IMF gave the advice yesterday when it presented its regional economic outlook for sub-Saharan Africa in Abuja. The IMF said though it projected Nigeria’s economy to grow at 2.1 per cent in 2019, it doesn’t reflect the potentials of Nigeria.
