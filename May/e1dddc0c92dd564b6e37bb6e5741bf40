The Kaduna state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna state did not insult APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu in anyway by his anti-godfather remark.

Recall that El-Rufai while speaking at an event on Sunday in Lagos, had said he would teach people how to end the reign of godfatherism in the state.

The Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide had fired back at the Kaduna state Governor for what it described as “abysmally insulting” remark.

According to the Council, El-Rufai lacked the credibility to utter such seditious statement in Yoruba land.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the party’s Assistant Publicity Secretary, Salisu Tanko Wusono, said the governor’s remark was only a call on registered voters to come out and vote during elections.

The statement read: “While many meanings have been read into what the Kaduna State Governor meant, it is imperative for us in the Kaduna State Chapter of the APC to set the records straight, more so that the Lagos State Chapter of the APC has also reacted albeit negatively.

“The Kaduna State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress wish to identify with the Kaduna State Governor and support his opinion on why every Nigerians should ensure massive participation in electoral process, because it is worrisome to see a situation where only One Million Voters would turn out to vote out of acclaimed Six –Million registered voters.

“Therefore, we are of the opinion that what the Kaduna State Governor said was just clarion advice that all hands should be on deck to ensure that every registered voters in Nigeria are encouraged to come out to vote on election days.

“Having found out from our interactions with many stakeholders, we discovered that Malam Nasir Ahmad El-rufa’i did not insult Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu or anybody for that matter at the occasion rather the Kaduna state Governor was only encouraging all registered voters to vote at every election so as to downplay the role of godfatherism in Nigeria politics just as it were in the recently concluded general elections where many political godfathers were sent out of business by Malam Nasir Ahmed El- rufa’I and All Progressives Congress (APC) Kaduna State Chapter.”
