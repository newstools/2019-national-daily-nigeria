Actress Tonto Dikeh is ditching Nollywood for the pulpit with her first sermon posted  on her Instagram page, preachifying to her fans about God’s love and word.
“He said in Isaiah 55:10-11, *“For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”* It makes no difference the crisis you might be facing in life; trust, and act on the Word.” she wrote Sunday morning.
Her message of salvation for mankind came about a day after the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) threatened to sanction her for “bad behavior”.
The actress recently made a You Tube video where she vomited lots of fluff about her broken marriage and ex.
For that, the chairman of the AGN BOT, Prince Ifeanyi Dikehad, said the association can’t put up with her any longer.
“No one marriage is perfect. Issues like that are private. It is very unbecoming of her to portray us in bad light. There are so many actors who have issues with their marriages without getting the public involved,” he said.
Her marriage and relationship might be sick to death, the actress blasted out a message of divine health for all God’s children.
“Romans 8:10 says, *“…if Christ is in you, although your body be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.”* Train your spirit to trust God and take Him at His word,” she wrote.
But her fans were not so amused.
Some were already calling her an absolute hypocrite, while few others described her action as a “scam”.
