Coach Paul Aigbogun has opted for a very offensive starting XI as the Flying Eagles go for broke against Ukraine tonight in the final Group D match of the U20 World Cup in Poland, National Daily gathered.

Rosenborg defender Igho Ogbu has replaced Valentine Ozonwafor, who is nursing a groin injury, while in defensive midfield Nnamdi Ofoborh from Bournemouth has come in for Jamilu Mohammed, who has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup.

Left winger Success Makanjuola will also get his first start for the Nigeria U20s.

Sweden-based forward Henry Offia, who scored against Qatar, has dropped to the bench for the first time in Poland.

The Flying Eagles must avoid defeat today to reach the knockout rounds of the tournament after they lost their last game 2-0 to USA.

Olawale Oremade – Ikouwem Udoh, Rabiu Mohammed, Aliu Salawudeen, Igho Ogbu – Nnamdi Ofoborh, Aniekeme Okon, Kingsley Michael – Maxwell Effiom, Tijani Mohamed, Success Makanjuola
