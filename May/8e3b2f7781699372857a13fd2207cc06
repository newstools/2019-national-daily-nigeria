The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has rejected the suspension of the National Chairman of the African Action Congress (AAC) by the party leadership.
The commission in a correspondence to the AAC leadership signed by Mrs. Rose Oriaran-Anthony, Secretary to the Commission, dated May 14, 2019, INEC making reference to AAC notification of the suspension of Sowore Omodele, national chairman of the African Action Congress, the deputy chairman, headquarters, and eight others, and the subsequent appointment of Leonard Nzenwa, as acting national chairman, indicated its review of the content of the letter dated May 13, 2019, and pointed out several flaws.
The INEC, therefore observed that there is no documentary evidence that a meeting of the AAC National Executive Committee (NEC) was convened by the National Chairman as required by Chapter 9, Section 59(a) of the Constitution of AAC.
INEC further observed that the party did not provide a 21-day notice of the NEC meeting as required by Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).
The commission further noted that there are no minutes or evidence of attendance of the AAC National Executive Committee meeting where the National Chairman was eight others were purportedly suspended.
INEC, therefore, declared: “accordingly, the Commission shall continue to recognize and relate with Sowore Omodele as the substantive National Chairman of the African Action Congress (AAC).”
