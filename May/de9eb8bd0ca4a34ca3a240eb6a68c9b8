After walking less than two kilometer, a teacher and single mum slumped and died during the Delta State Governor Annual Elders’ Tournament Walk tagged “Walk to Health” early in the week.
It was a 10 kilometre walk for Deltans between the age of 55 and 70 years, and the trek began at  Abraka Junction in Asaba through Dennis Osadebay Way, Nnebisi Road, Anwai road through to Government House, Asaba.
The woman, identified as Lovett Ighorodhe was a teacher at the Asagba Secondary school, Asaba.
Colleagues said Ighoorode was healthy when she left for the walk, adding that she was a native of Aboh in Ndokwa East Local Government Area of the state and in her 50s.
The corpse has been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, FMC.
While describing her as lively person, a neigbour said the woman was in the Guidance and Counselling unit of the school. Vanguard reliably gathered that the woman would be buried on June 22.
Ighorode was a single mother of three.
