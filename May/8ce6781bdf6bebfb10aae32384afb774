Onitsha shut down
No movement in other parts of south east Nigeria 

There are indications of total compliance with the sit-at-home order of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Thursday in south east Nigeria. The no movement directive was said to be successfully enforced in Igbo land in commemoration of Biafra Day. The order issued by IPOB penultimate week precipitated the deployment of troops to the south east by the federal government.
Reports reaching National Daily from the south east indicate that stay-at-home order was highly successful in several parts of the region. The commercial city of Onitsha was completely shut down despite the presence of the military.
National Daily recalls that the military had earlier assured the people of the south east of their security, urging them to ignore the May 30 sit-at-home order and go out for their businesses, maintaining that the federal government is determined to protect life and property in the region.
Despite the assurance from the government, National Daily gathered that the people willingly complied with the order to honour the fallen heroes during the 30 months Biafra War that erupted on May 30, 1967 and ended on January 1, 1970.
National Daily gathered that IPOB in a press statement on May 28 directed the residents to observe a sit-at-home order in memory of those who lost their lives in the three years Nigeria-Biafra war 1967- 1970.
Some stakeholders in the polity were of the view that the high level of compliance with the sit-at-home order of the IPOB demystified the counter order of the federal government. The people were said to be more conscious of what unite them than succumbing to external influence. They were said to uphold the hero in Nnamdi Kanu in high esteem.
