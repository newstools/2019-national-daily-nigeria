The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has stepped down after four years of controversial stewardship.
The minister also claimed he recovered N270 billion, up from N19.5 billion in 2015.
Mr Malami said this during a valedictory session to mark the end of his tenure as the ministry’s helmsman in Abuja on Tuesday.
The government, he added, is already trying to ensure the return of asset worth $500million from France, the United States and the Island of Jersey.
This is in addition to refund of the Abacha loot from Switzerland, adding that the sum recovered was N322.5 million.
Mr Malami explained that N19.5 billion had previously been recovered by the ministry before the commencement of the outgoing administration.
“It may interest you to know that as at 29th May 2015, the balance in the recovery account of the Federal Government of Nigeria stood at N19. 5billion. The balance has geometrically increased to N279 billion as at 22nd November 2017 and counting.
He mentioned as part of his achievement the presidential executive order six and eight– both created to safeguard public wealth.
“These instruments have uniquely revolutionised the war against corruption in Nigeria,” he said.
Mr Malami listed the achievements of the justice ministry in its implementation of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015.
In the meantime, the ministry’s permanent secretary and Solicitor General of the Federation, Dayo Apata, will be in charge.
