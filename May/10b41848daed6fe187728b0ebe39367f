For the first time in months, Edo Gov God win Obaseki is beginning to admit he has fallen apart with the state APC kingmakers led by the party’s national chairman Adams Ohiomhole.
Loyalists to Oshiomhole have made it clear Obaseki won’t have their support for a second term because he has betrayed his godfather Oshiomhole who mobilisd them to work for his election four years ago.
The governor however hit back on Thursday, saying certain politicians in the state are aginst him because he refuses to share the state money with them.
“Edo money is meant for the development of the state, and not for “a handful of greedy individuals,” Obaseki was quoted as saying on Wednesday at a training programme in Bennin City for teachers in the state.
“We do not have all the money in Edo but whatever we have – no matter how little – we will prioritise education and healthcare.
“What is important to us are things that affect ordinary Edo people. Those are the things the APC and I stand for,” Mr Obaseki.
Another reason he might forfeit a second-term chance is because he allegedly sidelined the party elders, and he is bringing in people from Lagos and Delta to benefit from his administration.
Obaseki asked the people of the state to ignore those attacking him.
“I want to assure you that my party is solidly behind me. I am not standing on my own. So, ignore and forget what you are reading in a section of the media.
“Those are people who want me to give them the money I should be using to train our teachers, provide for our children and develop the state. I will never give our people’s money them,” the governor said.
