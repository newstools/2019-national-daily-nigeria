Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has disagreed with the General Overseer (GO) of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Worldwide, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, over comment on change of service chiefs.

The former minister, who claimed that Boko Haram and other criminal elements have killed Nigerians in the last four years of this current government than at any other time, expressed worries that a respected man of God as Adeboye, should be the one advising President Muhammadu Buhari against changing the service chiefs.

Adeboye had while speaking at the headquarters of RCCG, the Throne of Grace, Ebute-Metta in Lagos, said that Buhari sacking service chiefs abruptly will not solve the insecurity situation in the country.

Responding in a statement on his official Twitter handle on Monday, Fani-Kayode, frowned at the statement credited to Adeboye and said he disagreed with the argument of Pastor Adeboye.


He wrote, “More innocent souls have been killed by terrorist organisations in the last 4 years than at any other time in our history yet a great man of God who we love and respect like Pastor Enoch Adeboye of RCCG will say that the Service Chiefs should not be changed? I humbly disagree!”
