The Nigerian judiciary has been under seeming fire since the episode over the sudden exit of former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, from service, which ultimately led to the urgent appointment of acting CJN, Justice Tanko Mohammed, by President Muhammadu Buhari.  While the hazy cloud of perceived illegalities is yet to clear from the horizon of the judiciary, the acting CJN has been brought to the cynosure of controversy over alleged falsification for which he is already being challenged in court.






National Daily learned that Tochi Michael dragged the Acting CJN to court over allegation of age falsification. The suit has been generating concerns over plots to destabilize the Nigerian judiciary.
A High Court in Abuja was said to have fixed May 31, 2019, for judgement in a suit filed by Tochi Michael challenging the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Mohammed, of alleged age falsification.
National Daily further learned that Justice Danlami Senchi fixed the date after the absence of the plaintiff and his counsel. It was indicated that Tochi Michael and his counsel were absent from the corut for the second time, failing to appear before the court to substantiate the allegation.
The plaintiff in his originating summons was said to have alleged that all official documents of the Acting CJN indicate that Justice Mohammad was born on December 31, 1953.
However, the development has seemingly provided respite for the Acting CJN and relative clean bill for the judiciary.
