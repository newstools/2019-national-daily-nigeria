Former Governor of Anambra State, Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections, before the swearing in of Emeka Ihedioha as Governor of Imo State on Wednesday in Owerri, demonstrated the true Peter the Apostle who neither had silver nor gold to give to the beggar at the beautiful gate, but what he had he gave him; and that was restoration of his sight. Obi in his apostleship gave Ihedioha his own experience and success story; rolling out five things the new Imo State Governor should not do or should do to succeed in governing the state.
Accordingly, Obi told Ihedioha:
1. Don’t fly chartered jets. Don’t Waste IMO Money on Chartered Jets. Why pay for millions when you can pay N40,000 and get to your destination.
2. Office of First Lady, it cost millions to maintain that office and you cannot afford it. IMO is in a mess. Your wife is the first lady of your house and heart, let her continue with her career.
3. Don’t turn Government house into a party house, those that want to drink should go to the bar.
4. Listen to those that criticise you, they are your best advisers. Always find out why they were criticising you.
5. Your predecessor leaves a debt of N100 billion verified. But for free advice on debt management, I will recommend former Governor of Cross River Lyle Imoke
