Minister of Interior, retired Lt-Gen Abdulrahman Dambazzau has described the report that President Muhammadu Buhari has given the sum of N100bn to Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACABAN) as figments in the imagination of mischief makers.
While fielding questions from journalists on Monday in anka, Zamfara state, Danbazzau described the report as fabrication of mischief makers who were keen on diverting attention from the ongoing killings in some part of the North.
He said, “Let me state categorically that during our meeting with members of the Miyetti Allah representatives, no issue of money was discussed at all, not to talk about giving them any.
“We did not give them even one kobo, the information being spread is the fabrication of mischief makers trying to divert from the matter facing us, which is the killing of innocent citizens.
“My visit to Zamfara today is in furtherance of that meeting to discuss with stakeholders and as you have seen, we are on course and confident that the issue of banditry in all the affected states is coming to an end,” he said.
