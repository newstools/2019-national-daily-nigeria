As the CEO, Lerman, noted, Yext  — which allows businesses to manage their profiles and information across a wide variety of online services — actually presented onstage at the TechCrunch 50 conference back in 2009. Now, it boasts a market capitalization of nearly $2.3 billion, and it just revealed plans to take over a nine-floor building in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood, turning it into Yext’s global headquarters.

Lerman vowed that he will remain CEO of Yext for “as long as this board will have me,” Lerman added that “the company is the ultimate vehicle in America to effect good in the world.”
