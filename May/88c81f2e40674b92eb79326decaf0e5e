Niger Tornadoes FC of Minna sole administrator Engr. Ibrahim Dada has urged the team to do everything they can to beat Kwara United this weekend at home, National Daily learnt.
Sunday’s match will be the last league game for both teams in the Nigeria Professional Football League this season.
Niger Tornadoes got relegated after 2-0 defeat in Aba against Enyimba FC last weekend.
In a chat with Tornadoes Digital Media  Engr. Dada disclosed that the management did everything they could to sustain the premiership status despite the team poor runs this season.
“I have watched the lads played this season and I must say they did a fine job, most especially against Enyimba FC in Aba”
“We are putting everything in place for the team to secure a premier league ticket next season in the Nigeria National League (NNL) because Niger Tornadoes is an elite football club.
“The damage has been done before we took up the office and we did everything we could to get out the club out of the relegation”
