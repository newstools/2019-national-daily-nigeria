Total electricity black is imminent in some part of the country following the collapsed of Nigeriaâ€™s electricity grid on Thursday, the second in two days.

It was gathered that the previous collapse that occurred on Wednesday was on gradual restoration when the later collapse occurred.

The development, it was gathered, has left many states without power completely.

A source privy to the occurrence said for nearly two hours, the entire franchise of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) comprising Kogi, Abuja, Nasarawa, and Niger states have zero megawatts, no electricity.

According to him, the collapse also affected states like Sokoto, Kaduna, Kano and Katsina under Kaduna Electric and Kano DisCo, it was gathered.

Although the remote and immediate causes are being ascertained, officials of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said they are working hard to restore the power grid shortly.

In June 2018, the country was thrown into darkness after the national grid suffered acute gas shortages to fire turbines. The TCN responded swiftly to the crisis, but it took more than 72 hours to resolve the failure.

Even though Nigeria generates a fraction of the energy it needs to power the country, consistent power failures have continued to assail the little progress it occasionally records in the sector.
