The outbreak of Ebola epidemic has claimed over 1,000 lives as the government struggles to maintain adequate treatment centres in the country.
The Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of Congo had admitted that the death toll from the Ebola epidemic in the country is now over 1,000.
The World Health Organization (WHO) Deputy Director, Dr Michael Ryan, had decried that mistrust and violence was obstructing efforts to tackle the disease as it spreads through the Eastern parts of the country.

Michael Ryan had further acknowledged that there have been 119 documented attacks on medical centres and staff in the country since January 2019.
The World Health Organisation had declared that, “there are plenty of vaccines and more than 1000 people have already been given treatment;” lamenting: “But continuing violence in the eastern part of the country where militias are present, as well as mistrust of doctors, is hindering the W.H.O’ s disease control programme, in the country.”
It was noted that the Ebola broke out in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2018 and is still increasing the more eight months after it began.
It is identified as the second deadliest in World history, so far.
Between 2013 and 2016, Ebola had killed 11,310 persons in West Africa.
