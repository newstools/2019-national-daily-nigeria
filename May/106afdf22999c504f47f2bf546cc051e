The Commission in a statement by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, in Abuja on Friday, acknowledged that the Supreme Court ruled that the All Progressives Congress (APC) did not hold valid party primaries as required by law. “It held that all the votes scored by the APC in the said elections are wasted votes and declared that the candidates of political parties with the second highest valid votes and the requisite spread should be declared as having been elected,” INEC remarked.
The Commission will, however, continue the meeting on Saturday to further deliberate on the issues arising from the said judgment, while the final decision on the matter will be communicated to the public on Monday.
