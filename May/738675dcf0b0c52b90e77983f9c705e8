Sule Lamido, Jigawas former governor, has told former President Olusegun Obasanjo to exercise caution and temper his anger against the election of President Muhammadu Buhari for another term.
He also asked the former president to withdraw his statement on the Fulanisation and Islamisation of Nigeria and West Africa which Obasanjo stated in a speech he delivered at an Anglican Church event in Delta weekend.
“Please sir don’t let your disappointment with sitting presidents turn you into a bigot. You must not abandon the national stage,’” the former governor said in a press statement on the weekend.
According to Lamido, if Obasanjo had said that elsewhere toa different group of people, it could have been tolerable.
“The cracks along the various divides in our National cohesion are already turning into huge gorges,” Lamido said.
The two were opposed to the re-election bid of Buhari in the Feb 23 presidential election, and both played some partisan roles in ensuring the PDP and its candidate Atiku Abubakar carry the contest.
But Obasanjo, who has always claimed he’s a nationalist, now narrows down on Fulani herdsmen, the purported N100 billion said to have been given to them, and other insecurity issues relating to the north.
