Pointek, Nigeria’s leading retail store for technology products, has made public its plan to train 1,000 gadget technicians in order to bridge the unemployment gap in Nigeria during a press conference held in Lagos on Tuesday, 7 May, 2019.

According to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), unemployment and underemployment rates in Q’3 2018 were 23.1 per cent and 20.1 per cent respectively, with global experts explaining that employment generation can be duly facilitated through small and medium scale businesses.

“With the youth constituting about 70 per cent of Nigeria’s rising population, we need to have an inclusive economy that will spur national socio-economic growth,” said Emeka Oguchi, Managing Director, Pointek.

“While it is the role of the government to provide an enabling environment for business, private institutions and other stakeholders have to consistently create and support activities that will improve the economy”.

According to Oguchi, competent gadget technicians and entrepreneurs will be produced through the trainings while also making sure that the beneficiaries harness hidden opportunities in the technology sector.

“We are extremely proud of our brand reputation among customers across Nigeria and we intend to leverage on this to improve lives by creating jobs and building new businesses. We also believe that this will be effective in curbing social vices as the trainings are focused majorly on students and prison inmates. The first set of training were recently carried out at Technical School, Agidingbi,” he stated.

The event featured insightful sessions as speakers highlighted the issues and opportunities present in the industry, including the benefits of speedily addressing unemployment in Nigeria.
