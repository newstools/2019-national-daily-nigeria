Sunshine Stars ascendancy in the business end of the season was halted on matchday 20 with 3-1 defeat to Katsina United at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium, Thursday.

The Chanji boys raced to a 2-0 lead inside 22 minutes through Eric Gwammy and Martins Usule before Tasiu Lawal added the third with the last kick of the first half.

Sunshine Stars only goal came in the second half of the game courtesy of Obasi’s free kick.

The Akure side arrived the Northwest three points within play off positions of the cagey Group A, but got off to a rather forgettable start, squandering chances to take the lead twice through Chibundu Amah inside the opening 11 minutes.

Eric Gwammy however punished the visitors for misfiring in the 19th minute with a blast to put United ahead before lanky forward Martins Usule doubled the advantage three minutes later.

Just before the break, Tasiu Lawal added the third for United with a freekick to mark the end of an enduring first forty five minutes.

The Akure side came out fighting in the second half, but Katsina United’s cushion could not be punctured by the Stars onslaught of  Kolade Adeniji, Amah and Fuad Ekelojuoti.

Full back, Obasi pulled one back for Sunshine Stars late on in the second half, but it was only as good as a consolation as the scoreline stood 3-1 at full time.

Sunshine Stars hunt on the road continues on Matchday 21 with a stopover against Bendel Insurance in Benin.
