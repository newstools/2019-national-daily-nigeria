A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode has described most Nigerians as cowards because of the indolence of the people to confront their oppressors within the corridors of power.

The chieftain of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) made this known in a post on Twitter, Wednesday morning.

He also slammed Nigerians for refusing to speak truth to power and failing to confront the monstrous beast that has held them in captivity.

According to Fani-Kayode: “Nigeria is not a nation: she is an occupied territory of slaves, vassals and quislings that are not prepared to confront the monstrous beast that has held them captive and in bondage for the last 4 years.

He specifically said that supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari see him as someone who is greater than God.

“Most Nigerians are so cowardly that they dare not even speak truth to power. If Buhari asked his supporters to put their faces under his buttocks and literally eat his faeces, 99% of them would gladly do so.

“That is how badly he has damaged their psyche and destroyed their self-esteem.

“To them, Buhari is worthy of worship and is greater than god.”
