The River State thespian, Tonto Dikeh, has been making headlines in the past weeks for her recent filmed reality series. The project has been largely about clarifying what actually went down in her damaged marital relationship with one time sweet heart and husband Olakunle Churchill.  She narrated why she dumped her ex hubby.
She may also have dumped the movie industry as she took to her Instagram page to preach to her fans about God’s love for his people.  Her action is came less than 24 hours after the chairman of Board of Trustees (BOT) of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, (AGN) Prince Ifeanyi Dike, threatened to sanction her over “bad behaviour” exhibited concerning her marriage.
Dike said “She is exhibiting bad behavior that we will no longer condone. What she should realize is that every marriage has its own issue. No one marriage is perfect. Issues like that are private. It is very unbecoming of her to portray us in bad light. There are so many actors who have issues with their marriages without getting the public involved.”

“Her actions do not speak well of the industry. We are not interested in her private matters; rather we are concerned about her attitude which is rubbing off negatively on other actresses.”
“Actions like this portray the industry as having unserious ladies. That is why men are scared of marrying actresses. Thank God that we have good examples in the industry. If she is looking for sensation, she should look for something else to use.”
“Honestly the Board of Trustees is not happy with her and if she continues this way we will sanction her. We do not encourage bad behavior.” However, Tonto Dikeh, in her Sunday morning sermon, urged fans to always trust the word of God as it had never failed.
