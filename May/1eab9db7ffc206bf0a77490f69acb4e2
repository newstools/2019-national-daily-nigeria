This is not the best of times for governor of Kogi state, Yahaya Bello, who has been under fire lately over accusations of non-performance and bad leadership.

The latest attack is coming from the All Progressives Congress (APC) Aspirants’ Forum, Kogi Chapter, who have appealed to the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole not to give the governor a second time.

In a communique signed by the forum’s chairman on Monday in Abuja, Ben Adaji, the forum accused Bello of bad leadership, adding that giving the ticket to Bello to run for a second term would be a risk, saying the party may lose the state to the opposition.

It said Bello had remained adamant in spite directives by President Muhammadu Buhari to all APC governors to reconcile and accommodate the party’s aspirants after the last primaries.

The communique alleged that Gov. Bello had continued to treat Kogi aspirants as enemies and second class citizens in the party they laboured for.

It said the forum had therefore resolved to mobilise and support one of its members to contest the forthcoming primaries and the subsequent governorship election slated for November.

It added that after much deliberations and debate, the forum nominated three of its members which included: Alhaji Yahaya Audu, Dr. Chief Adedoyin, and Dr Toyin Akanle for the contest.

“At the end of the deliberations, Alhaji Yahaya Audu was unanimously endorsed to contest the forthcoming Kogi Governorship Election,” the communique said.

The also forum used the opportunity to pledge unalloyed support for the President Buhari administration.
