It was gathered that a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Correspondent, who was among the passengers, narrated that the almost five hours flight from the Ethiopian capital to Lagos, had been smooth until the pilot attempted to land at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja.
The Pilot rather than landing on the first touchline of the runway, had over short the touchline because of the rain and heavy wind, and landing on the third touchline.
“On realising this, the pilot quickly manoeuvred the plane back to the air, flying out of the Lagos airport.
“After hovering around between Lagos and border communities of Ogun State, causing panic among the passengers and crew members, the plane landed in Lagos airport, some 20 minutes after the initial unsuccessful landing,” it was narrated.
