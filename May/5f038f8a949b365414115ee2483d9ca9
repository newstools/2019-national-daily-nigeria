The President, Nigeria Computer Society (NCS) Prof Adesola Aderounmu has called on the federal government to ensure 100 percent compliance of Executive orders 003 and 005 if we are to solve the unemployment menace in the country.
He noted that presently, compliance to the orders are not being implemented 100 percent, stating that government should ensure that it supports ailing local IT Firms to scale up in order to stop mass exodus of exceptionally brilliant indigenous ICT skills to other countries who will sell the same skills back to Nigeria at exorbitant rates and attendant capital flight.
Prof Aderounmu made this call during a press conference to announce the 14thInternational Conference of the Nigeria Computer Society (NCS) billed to hold from Tuesday 16th to Thursday 19th of July, 2019, at the International Conference Centre, Gombe.

He emphasized that support for local content in public procurement by the Federal Government will definitely contribute in the creation of more jobs for our present and youthful population.
The NCS President also urged the federal government to lead by example by ensuring that it comply with its obligation with regard to the services rendered to her through REMITA software.
He decried the inability of government to hold its part of its agreement with SystemSpecs despite the services rendered to her through REMITA software.
He implored on the federal government to pay SystemSpecs the total cost of all their services rendered to date.
Prof Aderounmu noted with regrets the disturbing high level of disregard for contracts entered into with indigenous firms compared with the “high level of respect” accorded to foreign counterparts by the government.
Giving further insight on how government could have solved the unemployment crisis in Nigeria, Prof Aderounmu said that IT projects could resolve the unemployment crisis in the country if properly executed.
