Video game addiction consists of “a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behavior [that] takes precedence over other life interests,” according to WHO. Shekhar Saxena, a WHO substance mental health and abuse expert, explains that the organization conducted global research on the phenomenon before putting video game addiction in the ICD.
