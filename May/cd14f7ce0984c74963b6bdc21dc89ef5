Misal was said to have noted that the Command was deploying intelligence to establish if it was a kidnapping case since no contact had been made with anyone claiming to be responsible of the disappearance of the woman.
“The police were not alerted on time about the incident but the permanent secretary is missing; so, we are using our intelligence to ascertain whether it is a case of kidnapping,” he said.
A resident of the area was said to have narrated that the gunmen invaded the house at Kasuwan Mbera Area of Jalingo, at about 2:17 a.m., forcefully opened the gate and threatened to shoot anyone who tried to stop them from abducting the permanent secretary.
