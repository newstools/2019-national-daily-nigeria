Uche Maduagwu has stated that Tiwa Savage is way bigger than Kenya’s music industry as he warns Victoria Kimani over the beef between both singers. Recall that Victoria Kimani who is from Kenya sparked the beef when she dissed Tiwa Savage in her #fuckyouchallenge cover with claims that she sleeps around with old men.
Reacting to the beef, Uche Maduagwu shared on social media: @victoriakimani Humble yourself because @tiwasavage is bigger than the whole of Kenya music industry… My dear, if you are that spectacular or your songs are that “great”, why do you bring it over to Nigeria to promote it? First of all, @tiwasavage is like a big sister to me, just got off the phone with my sister also, enough of all this nonsense abeg.

Right here in Naija, there is only one QUEEN of contemporary music, and that’s @tiwasavage Listen, Google my name, I’m the only popular ACTOR in Nigeria  that has ever gotten the attention of @chrissyteigen an A-List American celebrity.
He continued…
“Dear @victoriakimani You should be grateful to we Nigerians for accommodating and allowing you have small BREAD on your table  with this your kind of music, I’m not saying your songs are “watery oh”, because I’m not God, but if you know you are not going to LOVE, embrace and RESPECT our music legends, abeg, should I speak to the Nigerian immigration?Its not by force to do music in Nigeria, please, RESPECT our legends here, and RESPECT your elders in this music business.”
