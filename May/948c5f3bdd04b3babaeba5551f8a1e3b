A man identified as Gbenga killed his mother in Akure Thursday as arguments spiralled into violence that resulted in the death of 57-year-old Ajimo.
Gbenga then ran down to Ikare Akoko, Oyimo Quarters, on Friday.
Ajimo was not living with Gbengaâ€™s father. The couple divorced years back, and the wife remarried. It was in the house of his step-father that Gbenga killed his mum.
As the police closed in on Gbenga, he decided to end it all by sneaking into the kitchen late in the night to hang himself.
His dangling body was discovered Saturday morning.
Ondo Police Public Relations Officer Femi Joseph confirmed the incident.
He said the command had started investigation.
The rate of suicide in Nigeria has been on the rise lately. No fewer than two incidents were recorded between May 1 and 4.
