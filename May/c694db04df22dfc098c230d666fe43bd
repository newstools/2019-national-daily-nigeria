The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has made it known to the public that they demand an apology from Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, for allegedly misleading the nation and heating up the polity.
The main opposition said the minister levelled unfounded security breach allegations against it and its presidential candidate in the February 23 election, Atiku Abubakar.
A statement yesterday in Abuja, the nation’s capital, by PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan said the minister’s doublespeak exposed the fact that he, acting for the Federal Government, only conjured up claims to create the impression that the PDP and Atiku had set security breaches against the President’s inauguration.
Describing Mohammed’s allegations as phantoms, the PDP accused the minister of desperation to secure acceptance from Nigerians for the Buhari administration.

“We also have fears that Alhaji Lai Mohammed could have made those wild claims in a bid to pave the way to frame, harass, arrest and detain some opposition figures on trump-up charges.
“Such antics have failed as Nigerians have seen through them and are resolute, behind Atiku Abubakar, in the determination to retrieve his mandate in the court…
“By his fabricated claims, the Information Minister only succeeded in further de-marketing our dear nation in the international arena, causing more damage to investors’ confidence in our system and exposing this administration as purveyor of fake news.
“The PDP, therefore, invites Alhaji Mohammed to apologise to the nation and desist from such acts of incitement.”
