The Chairman of Delta Force Football Club of Asaba Mr. Emmanuel Chidi-Okonkwo told newsmen recently he was  attacked by an organized mob led by Uche Onuoha of Ifeanyi Ubah FC  at the IU Stadium, Nnewi.
The player has, however, denied anything like that took place.
Onuoha told the National Daily that he never came close to the Delta Force chairman .
The former Delta Force player said he was surprised when he read the news about him attacking  Mr. Chidi-Okonkwo .
According to him, the chairman  was leaving the stadium, and was interacting with a friend when Onuoha accused him of bias.
Onuoha explained that the main problem is that he refused his proposal to manage him, and the chairman petitioned the LMC that he was not cleared yet from  from Delta Force.
Onuoha is still a registered player of the club, though he was on loan to the IFUFC
The player admitted he mentioned it to some fans that the chairman was owing him.
“And they went to confront him to please pay me entitlement owed me by the club. No one touched him,” he said.
“It was after I left  someone told me the  chairman was held by another player whose international passport the chairman has–and some money for travel, too.”
Surprised, Onuoha added the man that claimed he  was assaulted was escorted to his car by the IUFC  chairman Chukwuma Ubah and team manager Jonathan Igwe.
“So how could I have assaulted him in the presence of the two club officials?”
