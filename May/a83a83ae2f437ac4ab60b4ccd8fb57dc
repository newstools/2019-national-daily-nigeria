With less than four weeks to the end of his tenure as Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki has canvassed for strong parliament as the 9th National Assembly prepares to elect new leadership in June.

Saraki who disclosed this when he received the Arewa Online Publishers’ Forum in Abuja, explained that without a strong parliament and the principle of separation of powers among the three arms of government, Nigerian cannot move forward.

According to him, without a strong parliament and principle of separation of powers among the three arms of government, Nigeria cannot move forward.

He said: “As long as our parliament is strong, Nigeria will be stronger. I think it is important that we lay a solid foundation to strengthen our democracy.”

The Senate President noted with satisfaction that the media has been playing an important role in ensuring the survival of democracy.

“You have responsibility to ensure that individual interest gives room for collective interest for a better Nigeria for all”, Saraki said.

Recall that the All Progressives Congress (APC) had anointed Senator Ahmed Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila for Senate President and Speaker position, respectively.

But they may face opposition during election of principal officers, as there are moves to stop their emergence by those uncomfortable with the endorsement.

A similar scenario played out in 2015 when Saraki and Yakubu Dogara emerged despite the party’s insistence on Lawan and Gbaja as fondly called.

The duo are currently Senate Leader and House of Representatives Leader respectively, with Lawan succeeding Senator Ali Ndume, who is now challenging him for the number three position in the country.
