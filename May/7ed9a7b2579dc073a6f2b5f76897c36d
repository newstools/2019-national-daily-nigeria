The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, says President Muhammadu Buhari actually picked the House Leader, Femi Gbajabiamila (APC, Lagos) for House of Reps Speaker, and not the APC national leader, Bola Tinubu as being insinuated in some quarters.
 
El-Rufai disclosed this on Friday when the Femi/Wase Campaign, alongside over 120 other lawmakers, paid him a visit at the Kaduna State Government House.
 
“There was a misconception that Femi’s candidature was from Bola Tinubu but the fact is that it was President Muhammadu Buhari himself who chose him because of his commitment and dedication to legislative duties.

According to the Governor, President Buhari took the decision while he was away from the country, adding that some his colleagues raised some misgivings but it’s just a matter of working chemistry, whom you can work with comfortably; not competence or whatever, he explained.
 
 
“The last four years in the National Assembly have taught us bitter lessons about working chemistry,‎ and here in Kaduna State, I take part in choosing who becomes the Speaker of the State Assembly.
 
“So, I told the President that he must be involved in the process this time around.
 
‎”Kaduna State believes in Buhari’s words, and I assure you that there would be no contest on June 11 when the leadership of the National Assembly would be inaugurated,” El-Rufai said.
