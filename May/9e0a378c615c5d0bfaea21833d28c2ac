Former Aviation Minster, Femi Fani-Kayode, has reacted to the call on Adams Oshiomhole to resign as the national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
In a letter dated May 27, and addressed to Oshiomhole said, Shuaibu said: “It is my honest opinion that your ability to ensure this party flourishes is deficient as you lack the necessary composure and you also don’t possess the capabilities and the requisite experience to run a political party.”

In series of tweets on Wednesday, the former minister argued that Shuibu is not alone, alleging that someone powerful and strategic was behind the call for Oshiomhole to resign.
Fani-Kayode said he was sorry about the situation Oshiomhole had found himself, regretted that after being used, the APC national chairman is about to be dumped into the dustbin of history.
“When your deputy publicly calls for you to step down you know that someone powerful and strategic is behind it. I feel sorry for my old friend and brother, Adams Oshiomhole. They have used him and now they want to dump him. Watch your back old friend: these guys don’t take prisoners,” Fani-Kayode wrote on his Twitter handle.
