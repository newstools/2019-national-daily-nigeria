The air task force of “Operation Lafiya Dole” on Tuesday disclosed that the unit bombarded a location at Bula Korege on the outskirt of Sambisa forest in Borno State which the Boko Haram terrorists use as meeting venue. 



The attack was said to be carried after successive days of surveillance that led to the discovery that some structures within the settlement were being used as a rendezvous by the terrorists from where they launch attacks against troops and civilians.
Air force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, in a statement indicated that a fighter aircraft was deployed to attack the hideout, scoring hits within the target area, leading to significant degrading of the terrorists’ structures.
Several Boko Haram terrorists were said to be killed in the operations by the Nigeria Air Force.
