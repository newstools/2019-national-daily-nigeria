Ugochukwu Anumudu of Lobi Stars is predicting a tough contest for all clubs participating in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) Championships Playoff saying the tournament would be an interesting spectacle, National Daily gathered.

The former U-17 World Cup winner, joined Lobi stars of Markudi at the start of the season from El-Kanemi Warriors where he also spent one season.

Anumudu who is also in the National U-23 squad campaigning for a place in the Japan 2020 Olympics, explained that all six teams in the playoff have quality players that are good enough to win the championship.

‘It’s going to be a very tough one considering the teams assembled for the playoff. Majority of the teams have quality players, so it’s going to be very tough and interesting”.

Anumudu, who plays from the left back position is yet to score this season but is remembered by Nigerians for his brilliant strike against Brazil with Emmanuel Amunike’s World Cup in 2013. He is with the rest of Lobi Stars squad  in camp in Ijebu Ofe ahead of the tournament and are expected to leave this weekend for Lagos.

Looking at the fixtures, he noted that their opening match would be against FC IfeanyiUbah, a team they would be meeting for the first time this season having featured in different groups during the regular season.

“We are meeting them for the first time this season as we were not in same group in the marathon league, but we will see how they operate. By God’s grace we want to win the first match and that can give us the confidence ahead of the second match against Rangers International.

Anumudu has had lots of national team experience having also been part of the Flying Eagles squad that failed to reach the World Cup but he’s also enjoying his outings in the domestic league.

“This is my second season in the NPFL and it has been a good one for me,  hopefully soonest i want to play outside the shores of the country”, he dropped jocularly.
