The growing adoption and investment in financial technology has earned 11 deposit money banks about N124.5bn revenue from electronic transactions in 2018.
Nigerian banks have continued to introduce digital products into the financial sector and their operations, organising hackathons in order to develop tech solution to address problems in the industry, sponsoring innovation competitions and introducing chatbox and Whatsapp banking to improve user experience.
All these are believed to have contributed to the growth experienced in the revenue from electronic transactions by the banks.
Analyses of the audited 2018 annual reports of 11 banks showed their revenue from electronic transactions grew by 43 per cent year-on-year from the N86.72bn earned by the financial institutions in 2017.
The revenue was generated from the fees and commission that the banks charged their customers when they carried out transactions through Automated Teller Machines, USSD, Internet banking, Point of Sale payments and agency banking.
Some of the banks assessed are Zenith Bank Plc, First City Monument Bank Plc, Access Bank Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc, Sterling Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria Limited and Fidelity Bank Plc.
