Governor victimizing me for refusing to rig 2019 election

The Emir of Kano, His Highness, Muhammed Sanusi II, has fired back at the Governor of Kano State, Dr. Abdulahi Umar Ganduje, over the splitting of the Kano emirate into smaller particles to whittle his power and control. The Emir revealed that the Kano governor approached him to assist in manipulating the 2019 elections in the state which he declined. He noted that he never insulted the north with his lamentation of rising poverty in north.
Emir Sanusi had declared: “The whole drama is about 2019 elections. Ganduje has begged me with money to help him subvert the will of the people by rigging the election but I declined.
“I never insulted Northern people. I said the poverty levels in the north are among the highest in the world. How does that become insulting people?”

Emir Sanusi further narrated: “I also said it is fine to build light rails but, please, let private sector do it. And don’t borrow N800 billion to build N10km of urban rail. I did not abuse anyone or call any name or insult anyone.
“I said the FG is spending 66% of its revenue on interest payment, quoting the IMF article IV., and when you are in a debt hole this big, you don’t dig. States have just been bailed out of debt by CBN. They should not be pilling more debt for future generations. Their resources should be for education and health. Where in this did I insult either politicians or the people?
“I have reflected over and over on my speech and I still don’t see what I said that is so wrong and offensive. I didn’t say the North cannot survive as a country. After all, Niger Republic is there with some help from Paris. I didn’t say that the North in the past had no glory. I know it has a rich history. I didn’t say the North can not be rich and better. In fact, I think it can and it is a disgrace we are where we are.”
