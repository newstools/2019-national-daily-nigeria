The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has urged the Mobile Network Operator (MNOs) and their Site Built Contractors (SBCs) to adhere strictly to the guidelines and technical specifications approved by the Commission when building telecoms towers.
Controller, NCC Zonal Office Ibadan, Yomi Arowosafe, gave this charge during a meeting recently held by the Zonal Office with the MNOs and the SBCs as part of the Commission’s strategic collaborative engagement with the MNOs, Collocation and Infrastructure Sharing Licensees, and the SBCs.
