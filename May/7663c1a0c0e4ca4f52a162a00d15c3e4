The former minority Senate Leader, former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Obong Godswill Akpabio, is seeking the face of God in the post-2019 general elections era, perhaps, to reverse the seeming political misfortunes he encountered in the elections. There are indicators that the former governor might have visited Italy for spiritual help.
Akpabio on the social media posted photographs he took with wife while in Italy. The senator in his footnote on the pictures wrote: “With my wife Unoma, posing with the statue of Saint Padre Pio in Italy where we undertook a spiritual retreat for a peaceful democracy celebrations commencing 29th May 2019.”
The former Senate Minority Leader in the National Assembly defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) towards the take off of electioneering campaigns for the 2019 general elections. He assumed the leadership of APC in Akwa Ibom State after his defection. Unfortunately, Akpabio suffered devastating and unanticipated defeat in the general elections, losing his own re-election into the Senate where he was perceived to be aspiring for the President of the Senate.
