A notable critic of President Muhammadu Buhari, Reno Omokri, has commended him for re-nominating the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Godwin Emefiele, for another term in office.

President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, on Thursday read a letter from President Buhari at plenary, reappointing Emefiele as governor of the CBN, for a second term.

Emefiele, a former group managing director of Zenith Bank Plc, was first appointed in 2014 by former President Goodluck Jonathan and was retained by Buhari when he took over power in 2015.

The letter for the tenure renewal was reportedly signed by Buhari on Wednesday and sent to the Senate President in line with the CBN Act.

In his reaction, Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, said Buhari has, by the nomination showed that he is listening to criticisms against him and has started to slowly shed his “clannish nature.”

Omokri stated this in a post on his official Twitter handle soon after the news of the re-nomination was made public.

He wrote, “I am a critic of President @MBuhari because I believe he is inept, and tribalistic. However, when he does well, I must commend him. In nominating Godwin Emefiele for a 2nd term, Buhari showed he is listening and is slowly shedding his clannish nature. For that, I commend him.”
