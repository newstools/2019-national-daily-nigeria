Dr. Godwin Emefiele has just been confirmed by the senate as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria for a second term.
On Wednesday, Emefiele was screened by the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions, during which he was grilled in issues affecting Nigeriaâ€™s economy.
The screening exercise came after the mandate given by President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, to the committee at the plenary on Tuesday. The committee was given one week to carry out the screening and report back to the Senate.
