Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, says time is up for the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as a political godfather, having been insulted by Governor of Kaduna, El-Rufai in Lagos.

Recall that El-Rufai had called on President Muhamadu Buhari to beware of overambitious members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), advising the president to deal decisively with such members.

The diminutive governor who spoke in Lagos at the weekend was ostensibly referring to Tinubu’s 2023 ambition, saying if not cautioned will make government difficult for President Buhari during his second term in office.

Reacting to the statement on his twitter account, Omokri claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari is working closely with Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai to openly insult Bola Ahmed Tinubu.


Omokri also added in the Twitter post that Tinubu has been used and dumped like a sanitary pad by Buhari, El-Rufai and other Northern leaders who have used him to achieve their political ambitions.

He wrote on his Twitter page on Tuesday; “Bola @AsiwajuTinubu should know the game is up when @MBuhari’s protege, @Elrufai, openly insults him. Don’t be deceived.

“El-Rufai won’t ridicule him, in Lagos of all places, without Buhari’s buy-in. They’ve finished using him. He‘s now as useful as a used sanitary pad! #RenosDarts.”
