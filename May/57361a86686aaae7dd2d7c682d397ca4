Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State is deepening the war with the Chief Judge of Kogi State, in which according to a report, the governor ordered the CJ out of the Government House, Lokoja, at an official state function of the swearing-in of the new Grand Khadi of the state.
National Daily learned that the swearing-in of the grand Khali was attended by top government officials, including judges from the judiciary.

The Protocol Officer of the Government House was said to have extended official invitation to the State Chief Judge for the state function.  The CJ was said to have already seated before arrival of the governor as protocol demands.
However, some minutes later before the arrival of the Governor, the Chief Security Officer to the Governor allegedly approached the CJ and informed him the Governor gave a directive that he should not be allowed to attend the function.
The CJ, thereafter, left the Government House and returned to his office.
There were insinuations that the ridicule may not be unconnected with the rift between the executive and the state judiciary over disagreements on table payment of judicial staff.
