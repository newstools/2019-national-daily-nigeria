The pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over his administration pampering of killer herdsmen.

In a communique issued at the end of a meeting of the group held at the residence of its leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, the group called on the Yorubas to activate the traditional self-defence system to defend themselves from the marauders.

The communiqué which was read by the group’s publicity secretary, Yinka Odumakin, said Yoruba people should “activate their traditional self-defence against the herdsmen attacks.”

The communiqué further read, “Unfortunately, the government in place has betrayed perceived complicity as we are not aware of any member of the group (herdsmen)  on trial for these monumental crimes even when Miyetti Allah has owned up to some of them.

“Instead, the regime has treated them with kid gloves, making excuses for their crimes with our Ministry of Information and presidential media office being made to look like Boko Haram and Miyetti Allah media centre as they issue statements to defend these groups even when they are not defending themselves with the Presidency equating Miyetti Allah with Afenifere and Ohanaeze in order to confer legitimacy on them.

“Of late is the insensitive and impunity-inspired decision of the Federal Government to open a Fulani Radio for the herdsmen in violation of the federal character spirit of our constitution.”

Spate of killings and other atrocities by herdsmen has remained a serious issue of concern to many Nigerians.

But the government seems not to be treating herdsmen issue as expected by many of the citizens, a situation that has warranted some people accusing the administration of helping herdsmen with an alleged agenda to Fulanize the country and Africa in general.
