An anti-corruption Advocate on Tuesday demanded President Muhammadu Buhari to constitute a high powered investigation panel to probe the disappearance of $2.1 billion (about N730 billion) said to have been recovered in the Malabu oil deal scandal involving former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed  Adoke.




National Dailylearned that the anti-corruption advocate, General Adamu Yusuf (rtd), at a press conference on in Abuja on Tuesday on the war against corruption in Nigeria by President Buhari, declared that the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari and a former Director General of the State Security Service, Lawal Daura, have full awareness of the recovered loot.
General Yusuf protested that the recovered fund is a huge amount that can fund developmental projects which can make life more meaningful for Nigerians; he alleged that the recovered loot was never deposited in the Federal treasury.
The activist advocated that 20 per cent of the recovered loot be paid to the whistle blowers in line with the Federal Government’s policy on whistle blowing.
It was narrated that on October 30, 2015, the $2.1 billion was recovered in an operation carried out by DSS operatives at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Housing Estate in Abuja and was traced to the former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice as part of the proceeds from the Malabu Oil Deal.
