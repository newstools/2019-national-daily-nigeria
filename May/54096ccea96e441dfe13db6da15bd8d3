After two years, the House of Representatives eventually passed a bill blurring the difference between the Higher National Diploma and Bachelor of Science in Nigeria.
Honourables Ali Isa and Edward Pwajok, sponsors of the two-year-old bill,  said Tuesday there was segregation when it comes to employment issues because “those having first degrees (university graduates) are placed on Grade level 8, while those having  HND are placed on grade level 6 or 7”.
The bill wants to end perceived discrimination against polytechnic graduates (HND holders) and remove the challenges they face, especially those in the public service.
It is already taking effect in some ministries—like the ministry of interior which supervises Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Prisons Service and Federal Fire Service.
But this might not change anything in the private sector.
Big corporations like Shell and others, by policy, put HND holders and third-class university graduates at the same level.
Pwajok in his lead debate said this “discrimination” against the polytechnic graduates “had no moral justification”.
According to him, the discrimination reflects in salaries as some organisations pay degree holders N100,000 at entry level, with  HND holders are paid  N70,000.
