It seems like just yesterday, Annie Idibia and 2baba’s baby mama, Pero Adeniyi, ended their age-long rift but it appears the peace is short-lived as they reportedly, recently shaded each other on social media. It was gathered that 2baba recently attended his 13-year-old daughter (Pero’s child) birthday party and was seen toasting to her and wishing her all the good things of life. It is also a known fact that Annie Idibia often wishes all of 2baba’s children well especially on their birthdays on social media.

However, on the occasion of 13-year-old Ehi, Annie did not wish her a happy birthday and fans suspect that it must have triggered something between the two women. It is unconfirmed if the two were indeed throwing shots at each other on social media but following the subject of the attack, it appears that all that peace-making that led 2baba to shed tears has gone into hiding.
In a posted video we see 2baba at the birthday party of his daughter. Pero Adeniyi who is identified as Persosaiyemi on Instagram, posted a series of post in which she stated that some people put up a good show on social media but are fake in reality.
