This is how to put your money where your mouth is.


Do the maths:


Thats 33,725 + 7,962 = N40k +


Not bad for my loyalty. They earn, I earn. We love football.


Okay some little interpretation for the novices among us:


What I did here was stake on two tickets. And ensure just same 2 games on both tickets.


Game 1.


Stade Rennes vs Monaco.


On this match I predicted a straight draw on both tickets.

Game 2.


Barca vs Liverpool.


On this match I had 2 predictions on both tickets.


For ticket 1, I predicted a correct score 3:0.


For ticket 2, I predicted that Liverpool wont score + Barca will win + the goals will be more than one.


So it all happened and I am in some good mood.


This is fun.
