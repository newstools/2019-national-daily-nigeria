Akwa United Football club twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with Abia Warriors Football Club of Umuahia in the penultimate game of this season’s Nigeria Professional Football League encounter decided at the Godswill Akpabio international Stadium, Uyo.


National Daily learnt the Warriors, who needed to win the game in order to improve their position on the group B table, went ahead in the 29th minute through midfield maestro, Fatai Abdullahi who blasted home from close range after combining well with Ibrahim Olawoyin, Shedrack Asiegbu and Jimoh Oni.



The ovation that greeted the goal from the Warriors bench was still on when Akwa United equalised through Godspower  Aniefiok two minutes later as he  needed just to tap into an empty net after the Warriors defenders failed to clear their lines.


First stanza ended 1-1 and both coaches, Rafael Everton of Akwa and his Abia Warriors counterpart, Emmanuel Deutcsh effected half time substitutions bringing in Ocheme Edoh for league top scorer Mfon Udoh and Obi Samson for Anthony Okemmiri respectively and both players justified their inclusion by netting the decisive goals for their teams.



Abia Warriors top scorer last season, Obi Samson netted his sixth for this term when he kept his cool to slot in with nine minutes remaining.


The Umuahia landlords had opportunity to put the game to bed but Obi Samson and Jimoh Oni could not take advantage.



As the visitors drums sounded louder with the hope of a possible fourth away win of the season, Ocheme Edoh punished them for their profligacy  when he nodded in the equaliser in the 90th minute.
