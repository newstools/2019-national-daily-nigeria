Speculations say one of Spur’s Pochettino and Chelsea’s Sarri could be the replacement for Maximiliano.

The two have been heavily linked with moves to Serie A to lead an ageing team of superstars once their respected European finals are over.

Sarri will lead his side to Baku to face Arsenal in the Europa League final, hoping to claim a first trophy in English football after the disappointment of losing to Manchester City at Wembley on penalties in the Carabao Cup final back in February.

Pochettino has a European venture to complete himself, after overcoming Borussia Dortmund and City in the earlier knock-out rounds before pulling off a Champions League miracle to stun Ajax and reach the final where Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool await them.
