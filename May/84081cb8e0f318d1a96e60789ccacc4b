For tweeting what the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar describe as defamatory, Lorreta Onochie, the Twitter hander of President Muhammadu Buhari, has been threatened with legal action.
The National Daily gathered it is going to be heavy: N500 million now, plus public apology—or N2bn later if the matter gets to court.
Onochie tweeted recently that Atiku is now on the UAE watch list for going to Dubai to shop for terrorists.
The presidency has raised the alarm it has evidence the PDP and Atiku are plotting to destablilze Nigeria.
But Atiku, in a letter his lawyer Mike Ozekhome wrote to Onochie, said it was a baseless allegation.
“Our client categorically denies each and every allegation in the said publication which is a figment of your imagination,” the letter stated in part.
Ozekhome also said Atiku has never been denied entry into the UAE.
He said for publishing such, she should retract the statement, and publish an apology in six national dailies, and one international publication. Theshe should pay N500 million in minimal damages.
All of these must be done in 48 hours—or else she will slammed with punitive damages of N2bn.
