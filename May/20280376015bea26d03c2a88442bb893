After tweeting he was proud of President Muhammadu Buhar for ensuring the prompt release of the Nigerian student heading to the gallows in Saudi Arabia for peddling narcs, Femi Fani-Kayode was all over the news for the unthinkable.
There were reports that the former minister and PDP jingoist had dumped his party and its presidential candidate Atku Abubakar challenging Buhari’s victory in the Feb 23 election.
Fani-Kayode has, however, denied those reports.
He said he was only ‘proud of Buhari’ for the timely release of the Aliyu Zenab.
“Reports that I said I am “proud of Buhari” and that I have “dumped PDP” and “joined APC” are false,’ he tweeted on Friday.
“Those that are peddling such vile mendacities and perfidious falsehood are insane.
“I commended Buhari for getting the young lady in Saudi Arabia out of prison but it stops there.”
Nigerian politics is notorious for cross carpeting, and it is no surprise if any politician rats on his party or associates.
