A group of indigenous Gbagi people of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT),Abuja, on Tuesday disrupted traffic on the Umar Musa Yar’dua Way to protest against the Federal Government.
The protesters blocked the highway for about an hour, causing traffic jams.
Some air travellers who were rushing to catch their flights at the airport were frustrated by the development.
The  protest was to drive home the demand for recognition as indigenous people.
“We came here to express our displeasure with the way the government and the military are seizing our lands without compensation, treating us like second class citizens in our own land,” a protester said.
“We are saying that henceforth, the position of the Minister of FCT should be held by an indigene instead of an outsider.
“We also want the government to treat us with respect because they keep taking over our lands and pushing us into the interior without proper compensation, “ he said.
