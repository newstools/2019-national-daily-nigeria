This may sound ridiculous because rather than putting heads together to find solutions to Nigeria’s economic, political and security crises, governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) under the aegis of Progressives Governors Forum turned to self-assessment and self-accountability, bestowing award to President Muhammadu Buhari for outstanding leadership when the northern Nigeria is engulfed in protracted civil war declared in the regions by various brands of merchants of violence.
Chairman Progressives Governors Forum, Governor Rocahs Okorocha of Imo State, at the award presentation, had extolled the leadership qualities of President Muhammadu Buhari, commending the
doggedness of the progressives’ governors who stood by the APC during and after the merger.
National Daily learned that President Muhammadu Buhari assured that his administration remains committed to improving the welfare of Nigerians notwithstanding the currentchallenges confronting the nation.
