It is another weekend of activities in the Week Five (5) of the Nigeria National League (NNL) in the Southern Conference and Crown Football Club of Ogbomoso will be guest to Ibom Youths Football Club,Uyo in the Group B4 fixtures.

The game will be played on Saturday 11th May, 2019 at the Training Ground of Nest of Champions,Uyo in Akwa Ibom State at 4pm.

The Group B4 table topper, Ajilete Warriors, having won two(2) home and an away games with seven (7) points from three (3) games, are very confident of victory against the Akwa Ibom side considering the present good form, well shapened and sharpened mindsets of the players.

Victory for the Oyekale-tutored side will see them comfortable on top of the Group B4 log thereby brightening their promotion chances so the lads must put in their very best in ensuring they pocket the three (3) maximum points at stake.

The Emmanuel Akpan led newly promoted side had a good start into the season but things have fallen apart as the team is battling at the bottom of the log with three (3) points from three(3) games, a home win and two (2) away losses.

A win for the home side will take them from the troubled zone so will want to do all things humanely possible to secure victory.

The end of the explosive and decisive encounter will answer the much asked questions by football pundits.

“Securing the three maximum points against Ibom Youths FC is not negotiable and I believe by His grace it is a done deal. My lads are fully prepared to put in their best and I’m sure  we shall win convincingly,” Oladunni Oyekale,Head Coach of Crown FC told National Daily.
