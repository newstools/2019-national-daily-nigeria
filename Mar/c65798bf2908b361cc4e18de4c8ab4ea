FC Barcelona president gave an interview to Cadena SER in which he said that Ousmane Dembele is better than Neymar.
The Brazilian winger left in 2017 for PSG and Barca signed Dembele from Borussia Dortmund to replace him.
Asked what he thought about Barca buying Neymar back, Bartomeu said: “I won’t say yes or no. I say that with their money, Barca made a sporting bet. With that money we went for players like Dembele and Coutinho. Dembele is better than Neymar. He’s at Barca and he is better.”
On Frenkie de Jong: “Frenkie will mark an important era at Barca.”
Rakitic: “He still has a contract.”
Jordi Alba: “He’s the best left back in the world.”
Post-Messi era: “We have to look for long talent. It will be a different Barca, but I don’t think it will happen soon. Messi has a contract until 2021 and I think we will give him another one. He’s stronger than ever. He’s got ambition and hope and we have Messi for some time.”
