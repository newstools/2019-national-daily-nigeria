Former Vice-president Atiku Abubakar, says no man alive has contributed more to the socio and political development of Nigeria like former President Olusegun Obasanjo.

He gave the remark while facilitating with Obasanjo on his 82nd birthday, describing the former president as one of greatest Nigerians alive today.

The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate said, who served as Obasanjo’s deputy for eight years, also wished him good health and continued service to the nation.

Writing via his Twitter handle on Tuesday, he said: “A very happy 82nd birthday to you, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo. No living Nigerian has given as much to Nigeria in peacetime and in war as you have.

“May almighty God grant you many more years in good health and continued service to Nigeria and the world at large”
Atiku fell out with Obasanjo during his second term in office.

His reported presidential ambition had pitched him against Obasanjo who was said to be nurturing a third term in office.

The duo, however, reconciled in the buildup of the presidential election after Obasanjo endorsed him.
