Manchester City or Liverpool to win the Premier League title this season?
For Manchester United fans it’s a prospect not worth considering, but Red Devils legend Rio Ferdinand has given his opinion on the matter and reluctantly revealed who he’d rather see lift the cup at the end of the campaign.
As things stand Liverpool are in the driving seat given that they are at the top of the table.
But last season’s champions Manchester City have a game in hand over the Reds and the opportunity to reclaim the top spot in their next match against relegation-threatened Fulham.
Who will win the title is still anyone’s guess, but most are in agreement it will definitely be either Liverpool or Manchester City.
So who would Ferdinand rather see lift the title?
“This is the worst possible case, scenario for someone that likes Man United, supports Man United and has played for Man United, and I’m a pundit that’s got to speak about it publicly and squirm and what not,” Ferdinand told Mirror Sport.
“So the better of the two evils is Manchester City winning the league as I’ve seen it, I’ve been part of it.
“I’ve seen it as a player and a football fan so I’ve been able to deal with it emotionally.”
When asked how he deals with rival clubs winning the title, he added: “You turn everything off. There aren’t many Man City fans to have a go at me.
“With Liverpool it’s a different story. There’s fans I didn’t even know supported Liverpool that have come back out of the woodwork after 20 years of being silent that are starting to speak before they’ve won anything so it’d be a lot more painful to see them win the league, but listen the best team will win it and whoever that is well done.”
