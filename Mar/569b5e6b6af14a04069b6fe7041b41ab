Some Italian media have announced a possible start of N’Golo Kanté at Real or Juve at the end of the season. What should we think ? Reply.
In recent days, some Italian media have mentioned a possible offensive of Juventus and Real Madrid for N’Golo Kanté on the occasion of the next summer transfer window. Should we believe it? The answer.
N’Golo Kanté thinks of a departure from Chelsea in June
According to our information, the context is indeed reunited for Juve and Real Madrid to position themselves on the world champion midfielder. As the 10 Sport revealed, N’Golo Kanté wonders about the possibility of Chelsea leaving at the end of the season, despite a contract extension in the fall. His relationship with the Italian technician Maurizio Sarri would not be unrelated.
The message was thus passed on the market of the big European clubs that a window of fire could exist around Kanté this summer. It is therefore likely that Real and Juve were solicited and that they scored an interest. As revealed by the 10 Sport, the PSG has also manifested itself, but it remains behind in the mind of the player.
