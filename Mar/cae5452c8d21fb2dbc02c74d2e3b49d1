Former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has urged the governor-elect of Oyo state, Engr Seyi Makinde to jettison a democratic system that promotes personal gains for a true democratic system.
In a statement issued by Obasanjo’s media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi after a private meeting with top PDP leaders in the south, including his former vice who contested the 2019 presidential election under the banner of the party, Atiku Abubakar, he advised Makinde to transparent and embark on developmental projects, which would be a delight to the people of Oyo state.
Obasanjo said, “Be “Please, run a government that will be making them to ask, where have this type of government been all this years in Oyo state. You must give them something positive, you must give them good democracy and not that one, my younger brothers will call pocketing democracy.
“Where there is a misunderstanding, call yourselves together and make peace in the overall interest of Oyo state. He cannot do it alone and since you have supported him now, you should continue to be together.
“You should be mindful that Oyo people are fearless and they don’t mind whose horse is gored, that is why you are there now.”
While speaking on the meeting, the governor-elect, in a statement, said that the meeting was to appreciate and seek for wisdom from the elder statesman.
Makinde admitted that the state was in a bad shape, and as such he was taking what Baba had told them with all vigour by going to work immediately.
The statement read “He had warned against corruption and transparency. We are very much aware of this too.
“With God, Oyo state will never be the same again. This is the type of visit that will give us the needed tonic to forge ahead positively in Oyo state.”
The statement also hinted that Chief George facilitated the visit between Makinde and Obasanjo
