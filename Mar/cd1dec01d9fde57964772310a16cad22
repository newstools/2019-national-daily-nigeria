Juventus’ signing of Aaron Ramsey has been hailed as a “great coup” by former Italy star Franco Baresi , who doesn’t see the Arsenal man having any issues in adapting to life in Italy, National Daily gathered.
Ramsey is set to end an 11-year stay with the Gunners and make the switch to the Serie A champions when his contract expires in this summer.
The midfielder has agreed a four-year contract with the Italian outfit and will team up with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala, Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci with the Italian champions.
But with the Serie A side set to pay just €3.7m to register Ramsey, Baresi sees the move as a brilliant one from a club who have dominated the league in recent years.
“I think Juve has really landed a great coup there and I’m sure he’ll be able to adapt to Italian football.”
Baresi, who won six league titles in Italy, was full of praise for Juve’s transfer business, but the Milan legend is also hoping their dominance in Italy will not last.
