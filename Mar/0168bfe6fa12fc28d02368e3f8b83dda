A Federal High Court sitting in Jos has struck out 19 of 21 charges against a former Gombe State Governor, Senator Danjuma Goje, and three others.
The senator and the three other firmer officials of the Gombe State government during Gojeâ€™s tenures are facing charges of alleged misappropriation, laundering and diversion of N6.6 billion belonging to the State.
The case has been dragging since Goje left office in 2011, and has been in the Senate of the national Assembly. However, the former governor still has two other charges to defend before the court.
