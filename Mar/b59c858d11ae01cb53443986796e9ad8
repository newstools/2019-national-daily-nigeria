The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said “the fabrication being peddled by the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) that its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is making some demands from President Muhammadu Buhari, as absolute falsehood and outright lies”


Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary, in a statement on Saturday, stated that Abubakar had not, and will never, make or accept any condition from President Buhari regarding the rigged February 23, 2019 Presidential election.

It noted that Buhari Presidency and the APC know that their electoral robbery cannot stand before any noble justices and are now allegedly attempting to use all sorts of blackmail and shenanigans to derail the quest by Nigerians to reclaim the stolen mandate at the tribunal.


It reads: “However, let it be known to President Buhari and the APC that Atiku Abubakar and the PDP are standing shoulder to shoulder with Nigerians in this collective determination to take back the stolen mandate and we are not ready for any form of negotiation with anybody on this matter.

“Our party and candidate remain committed to the huge sacrifices made by Nigerians in ensuring our collective victory as delivered at the polling units across the country; we are mindful of the pains that Nigerians are passing through since the subversion of their will at the polls; we are sensitive to the expectations that millions of compatriots place on our shoulders in this struggle and we will never let Nigerians down.

“We have all the authentic results from all the polling units as well as forensic evidence of manipulations by the APC and INEC. We will bare them all at the tribunal and the court will give justice to Nigerians.


“On that note, the PDP states unequivocally that nothing will change its resolve to pursue this despicable electoral fraud, unknown in our political history, to its end.
