Juventus have confirmed Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a minor thigh injury while on international duty with Portugal.
A statement released by the Italian club on Tuesday read: “Cristiano Ronaldo underwent tests in Portugal that revealed a minor injury to his right thigh flexors.
“He will be monitored and subjected to further tests to establish when he can return to competitive action.”
The 34-year-old was substituted midway through the first half of Monday’s Euro 2020 qualifying match against Serbia, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
Ronaldo insisted he was not too concerned in his post-match comments, and Juventus have confirmed the forward has suffered only a ‘minor’ injury.
