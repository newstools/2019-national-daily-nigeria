THE Chairman of Atiku-Obi Presidential Campaign Organisation, Anambra State, Mr Oseloka H. Obaze has called on Independent National Electoral Commission INEC, to make public polling unit results and other materials used for the February 23, 2019, presidential election.
Obaze, the former candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in Anambra 2017 governorship election and the immediate-past Secretary to Anambra State Government, made this call in a statement personally signed and made available.
According to him, it is intriguing that INEC continues to withhold polling unit results and other election materials, long after the presidential election results were announced.
