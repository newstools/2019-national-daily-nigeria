…insists they also enjoy him play
Barcelona moved 10 points clear at the top of LaLiga Santander as they beatReal Betis 4-1 at the Estadio Benito Villamarin, with Lionel Messi scoring a wonderful hat-trick which led to a standing ovation from the home supporters, something Ernesto Valverde wasn’t surprised by.
Messi’s third goal was a thing of beauty as he chipped Pau Lopez from just inside of the penalty area, leading to the entire Villamarin standing and applauding, with some home supporters even chanting his name.
“Our opponents suffer because of Messi, but they also enjoy him,” Valverdeexplained in his post-match press conference.
“His match tonight was extraordinary, he’s scored three goals and also made a fourth.
“The public has recognised his talent, they are enjoying seeing him in his prime and they respect him for the player he is.”
Betis created a lot of chances in the first half, although they rarely tested the Catalan giants, and the standard of Barcelona’s performance really pleased Valverde following the difficult midweek clash with Lyon in the Champions League.
“We came from an intense match in the week,” he admitted.
“We pushed hard and lived dangerously, we knew they were going to press us and take the ball for long periods.
“They played in an uncontrolled way, they took risks and we were a threat every time we crossed the halfway line.”
Victory on Sunday evening has left the Blaugrana 10 points clear at the top of the table in LaLiga Santander, leading many to suggest the title race is all but over, yet the former Athletic Club coach has urged his side to be wary of complacency.
“Today was a vital match, especially after Atletico [Madrid’s]’s defeat,” he confirmed.
“We’ve taken an important step, but we have to be cautious.
“It’s a league and we have to be careful because there is room for teams to catch up, we have to keep going.”
