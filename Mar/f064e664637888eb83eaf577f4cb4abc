The chairman of #Ourmumudondo Charles Oputa has finally revealed what transpired between him and Buhari[s Campaign spokesman Festus Keyamo.
According to the entertainer cum activist also known as Cahrly Boy, he received at least N100 million from the Buhari campaign group as payment for an Atiku-bashing music video he recorded, which Keyamo felt his organisation could use against the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar.
But the revelation  has driven Charly Bpy and his organisation farther apart since the first audio of the dalliance between the activist and the APC was leaked by one of its members Deli Adeyanju who has been having a running battle with the federal government.
He was released March 1 from detention since November last year.
Deji and other members of #Ourmumudondu said they felt betrayed. While Deji announced his resignation March 13, others still in have decided to  suspend the chairman.
According to Charly Boy, Keyamo visited him weeks before the election to discuss Deji’s detention since the three of them are friends, and it was along the line the APC campaign spokesman saw the music video.
The discussion switched to how Keyamo could obtain the license for the work.

“I do not care. But if you want to use my work, you pay for it,” Charly Boy recalled telling Mr Keyamo. “Of course, he paid for it. And they paid heavy,” Charly Boy said in a video of of his interview with online-based Roots TV that was widely shared on social media on Friday.


The video licence payout was not the first financial deal would rattle the cage of the activists in #OurMumuDonDu.  Allegations of financial mismanagement had been dogging the Oputa all along–though the group maintain a united and incorruptible facade.
