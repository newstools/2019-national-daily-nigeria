The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, postponed the election in Nasarawa/Binyeri State Constituency of the Adamawa State House of Assembly after the death of a candidate, Adamu Kwanate, for the constituency, thus, election did not hold in the constituency on Saturday as scheduled.
Kashim Gaidam, Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, in Adamawa State, announced this in Yola, at the weekend.
Gaidam noted that the postponement became necessary as a result of the death of Adamu Kwanate, a member of the house of Assembly and candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the election.
 Kwanate was said to have died on Wednesday after he collapsed during a campaign for his reelection. He died later in a hospital in Yola.
Gaidam said the postponement was to allow the party and the constituency find a replacement.
“We received a letter from the party and the House of Assembly regarding the death of the candidate and we have replied, giving them one week to find a replacement. We will communicate their replacement to the headquarters to fix a new date for the election,” Gaidam said.
