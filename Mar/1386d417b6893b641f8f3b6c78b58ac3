Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has condemned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for declaring elections in some states inconclusive.


INEC had announcement postponement of polls in Benue, Sokoto, Adamawa, Rivers and Adamawa, amid accusations that it was a plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) federal government to overturn likely victories of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

Reacting, the PDP presidential candidate, warned INEC to be on the part of the people.


He tweeted: “Anti-democratic forces are at work. My counsel to the Independent National Electoral Commission is as follows: Conclude on the side of democracy.

“Conclude on the side of the people. Conclude on the side of the constitution. Conclude o the side of Nigeria.”

Earlier, the PDP advised INEC to end its alleged manipulative schemes and immediately declare the result of the March 9, 2019 governorship elections in affected states.

Kola Ologbondinyan, in a statement, said the development was a premeditated plan by the APC-led Federal Government to use the instrument of INEC and security agencies to truncate the wishes of the people.
