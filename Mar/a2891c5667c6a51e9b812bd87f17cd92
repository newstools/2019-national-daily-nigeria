Lionel Messi had blood in his mouth after a clash with Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos during Saturday’s La Liga Clasico, claims Gerard Pique.
Messi and Ramos were involved in a flashpoint in the first half of Barca’s 1-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu that moved Ernesto Valverde’s men 10 points clear at the top of the La Liga table.
Ramos knocked the ball past Messi but then seemed to thrust his arm into the face of the Barcelona captain, who made his displeasure clear to the officials, although Madrid’s skipper was not punished.
“Leo had blood in his mouth,” said Pique. “It was an aggression.
“Intensity does not have to be measured. I get along great with the Real Madrid players.
“But when you go out to the field you defend your colours and the rivalry is what you get.
“But once the game is over, the cordiality is mutual, the players respect us very much.”
