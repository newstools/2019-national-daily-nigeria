Canadian pop star, Justin Bieber and his wife Hailey Baldwin have just snagged a Beverly Hills mansion for the sum of N3,042,405,000 ($8.5 million).
It is gathered that 25-year-old Bieber bought the house for himself and his model wife. It is also noteworthy that this is his first real estate purchase since offloading his Calabasas home back in 2012.
Findings reveal that the Biebers new home is a recently redone 1930s Monterey Colonial, which was previously owned by the same family for 50 years. The 6100 square foot space boasts five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, along with a library and home theater.
The mansion also boasts of aÂ  state-of-the-art kitchen with a spacious center-island and eat-in seating. There is also the feature of a wet bar and a wine cellar to entertain guests.
The outside area is home to a cabana with a fire pit, all overlooking a breathtaking zero-edge swimming pool and the front courtyard boasts of handpicked olive trees and an outdoor fireplace.
It would be recalled we reported earlier that Bieber recently asked fans to pray for him as he struggles with depression.
