Former Aviation Minister has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of declaring elections in some state inconclusive as well as suspending polls in some other states to favour the All Progressives Congress (APC).

According to the former minister and a chieftain of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) INEC’s reason for declaring elections inconclusive in some state is to once again repeat what the commission allegedly did in Osun State governorship election in 2018.

The PDP candidate had more votes before INEC declared Osun election inconclusive. During the rerun-election in some areas to decide a clear winner, the APC won the poll.

International and local election observers had claimed there were electoral irregularities allegedly perpetrated by thugs and security officers in favour of the APC during that rerun poll.

INEC had declared the Saturday governorship elections in Adamawa, Plateau, Kano, Bauchi and Sokoto states inconclusive. It also suspended announcement of results in Rivers and Delta states.

Reacting in a post on his Twitter handle Fani-Kayode said:

“Adamawa, Plateau, Kano, Bauchi and Sokoto declared inconclusive. Rivers and Delta results suspended.

“INEC has declared elections inconclusive in 5 states where APC is losing and suspended announcement of results in 3 states where PDP is winning.
