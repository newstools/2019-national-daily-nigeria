The Police on Thursday arraigned a 49-years-old woman Josephine Williams, in an Upper Area Court, Karmo, Abuja, for allegedly issuing out a dud cheque.
Williams who was with her three children in court, was docked on charges bordering on criminal breach of trust and cheating.
The Prosecutor, Ijeoma Ukagha, told the court that one Serge Dussou of Degok Hotel Gwarimpa, Abuja, reported the matter at the Area Command Police Station Life Camp, Abuja, on Jan. 18.
Ukagha alleged that the defendant booked a room for N8, 000 daily on Sept. 7, 2018 but refused to pay for the accommodation since then.
She said that the money accumulated to N1.5 million and on Feb. 15, she dishonestly gave him a cheque knowing there was no money in the account.
The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 312 and 322 of the Penal Code.
The defendant, however, denied committing the offences.
Mr F.I Nwodo, counsel to the defendant, applied for her bail on liberal terms.
The Judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, however, gave bail to defendant in the sum of N1.5 million with one surety in like sum.
He said the surety must be a Grade Level 10 officer in the federal civil service or a pastor with proves to show.
Maiwada also said she should not go back to the hotel and should write an application to maintain peace.
The case was adjourned until April 4, for further hearing.
