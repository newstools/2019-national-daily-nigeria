Osun State Government said the judgment of the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal which ordered the withdrawal of Certificate of Return from Governor Gboyega Oyetola has been put on appeal.
A statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Wole Oyebamiji, enjoined residents of the state to go about their lawful activities as the law enforcement agencies have been instructed to maintain law and order across the State.
The statement assured that Government of Oyetola is still the only legitimate Government having the authority to govern the state.
The Osun State Governorship election tribunal on Friday dismissed the separate objections filed by the All Progressives Congress and its candidate, Gboyega Oyetola, as well as the Independent National Electoral Commission against the petition.
Governor Oyetola, APC and INEC had filed their notices of preliminary objection contending among others that the petition was incompetent and that the court lacked jurisdiction.
The Tribunal consequently declared Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) winner of the September 2018 election, and ordered INEC to issue him certificate of return.
