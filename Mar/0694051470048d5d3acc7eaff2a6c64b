Azubuike Okechukwu has revealed that coach Imama Amapakabo has told the U23s they have to beat Libya tomorrow in Tunisia so that the return leg in Asaba will be a formality, National Daily gathered.
“The coach has told us to win the game before we come back home to finish the job,” Okechukwu explained.
The experienced midfielder is tipped to lead out the country in tomorrow’s U23 AFCON qualifier.
In the meantime, most of the foreign pros have joined up with the rest of the squad – Taiwo Awoniyi, Samuel Chukwueze and Kelechi Nwakali.
Italy-based David Okereke and Kingsley Michael as well as Orji Okonkwo, who now plays in the MLS in the USA, are due in today.
