The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has recorded political misfortune from the death of two newly elected lawmakers since the 2019 general elections in the country.
A lawmaker, representing Pengana Constituency in the Plateau State House of Assembly, Ezekiel Afon, died hours after he was re-elected to represent the constituency in the state legislator in Plateau on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The constituency is still waiting for the conduct of a by election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to refill the slot before the inauguration of the House.
Afon’s death was confirmed by Bashir Sati, State Secretary of APC in Plateau State. “It is unfortunate that we lost Afon, one of the most dedicated members of our party and a committed lawmaker just after he was declared the winner to occupy his seat again. Though, he has been sick for a while, we received the news of his demise with a rude shock,” Sati stated.
The dearth of Afon was followed by that of a newly elected member of the House of Representatives in the National Assembly, Garba Muhammad Butalawa, representing Kura, Madobi and Garun Mallam in Kano State.
Butalawa, elected on the platform of the APC, died at the weekend at Prime Clinic, Lamido Crescent in Kano after a protracted illness.
Again, the INEC is expected to conduct by election to fill the slot.
