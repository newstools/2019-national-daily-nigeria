Ekiti govt. threatens strict sanctions against sexual violence


     
An elderly man identified as an uncle of a 15 years old girl is undergoing interrogation for impregnating the girl whom he was said to have been molesting sexually since she was 12 years old.
Accordingly, Ekiti State Government has assured the people that it will impose more stringent sanctions in its fight against sexual violence.
The Attorney General of the State and Commissioner for Justice, Wale Fapohunda, who announced the new measures said that the rising rate of sexual offences in the state has become a source of concern.
There were reports that a 15 year old girl, under protective custody at the Social Intervention Centre in Ado Ekiti was being sexually molested by his uncle since she was 12 years old.
According to her, the man had impregnated her twice before neighbours alerted the authority.
This and several other reported cases of rape and child defilement is why Ekiti State Government is strengthening the existing laws in the state to fight the scourge.
The culprit who allegedly sexually molested his niece is in police custody while the case is being investigated.
