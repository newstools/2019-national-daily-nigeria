President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the dark days of impunity are gone for good, assuring Nigerians that his administration will remain focused and committed to creating an inclusive and diversified economy.
Receiving the leadership of the Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS), led by Obafemi Onashile, President Buhari, again, thanked Nigerians for clearly expressing their desire to move the nation forward.
President Buhari used the occasion to highlight his administration’s achievements in stimulating the economy in the past three years, noting that growing the nation’s economy means ‘‘national growth must impact the silent majority.’’
On the incessant building collapses across the country, the President warned that those responsible for such incidents of professional negligence will feel the full wrath of the law.
The President welcomed recommendations and suggestions from the Institute on how to enhance the construction industry, directing that they make a formal submission to the Minister of Power, Works and Housing as soon as possible.
In his presentation, the President of NIQS, Onashile appealed to the Federal Government to create a Directorate of Quantity Surveying and Projects Costs Management to address the issue of unclear delineation of professional functions amongst construction professions within the Government.
A highpoint of the visit was the conferment of the Fellowship Grade of the NIQS-the highest cadre of membership- on President Buhari. The President was also honoured with the ‘‘Life Champion of Anti-Corruption Crusade in Nigeria’’ Award.
