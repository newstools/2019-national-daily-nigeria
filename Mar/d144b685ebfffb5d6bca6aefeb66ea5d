Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane has admitted that he is eyeing a career in the National Football League (NFL) once his time as one of the world’s most feared No.9s is over, National Daily learnt.
At 25, Three Lions captain Kane is not thinking too seriously about retirement yet, but he now insists that he will not quit sport altogether when the time comes to hang up his boots.
A long-time NFL fan, Kane travelled to Atlanta in February to watch his beloved New England Patriots defeat the L.A. Rams to seal Super Bowl glory.
And Kane now has his eyes on becoming an NFL kicker in the future, believing that doing so could see him go down as one of the greatest sportsmen in history.

“It goes back to that drive to be the best. Even if I download a game on my phone, can I be the best in the world?
“If you play in the Premier League and the World Cup and you then play in the NFL, would you then be considered one of the greatest sportsmen ever?”.
