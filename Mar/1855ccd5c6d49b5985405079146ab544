Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, has revealed it position for the forthcoming 2019 governorship election in Abia State.
Rowland Ajuzieogu, the President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Abia State, in a statement issued to newsmen and obtained by DAILY POST on Monday evening, warned the elites in the state against truncating the agreement already existing between the Ukwa/Ngwa extraction and Old Bende bloc.
He asserted that all the senatorial zones in Abia had produced governors and stressing the need for the people of the state to support the Ukwa/Ngwa bloc to enable them complete its eight years in office.
Ajuzieogu, explained that, “The founding fathers of Abia State from its inception, put together a document christened Abia Charter of Equality, for the administration of Abia State.
“The intention of these founding fathers where for Ndi Abia in line with the provisions of the Charter to bring about peace, ethnic balance and development in the administration of the state.
The Ohanaeze President added,” It is, therefore, on this background, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, in the discharge of its obligation and function, called on the people of the state, to abide by the provisions of Abia Chapter of Equity in choosing the next governor for the state come March 9 gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections, as doing otherwise is a clear call for anarchy and instability.
“Based on the charter of Equity, it will be disservice to the people if we (Ohanaeze) do otherwise. So, for that reason, the charter of equity lays in favour of current Abia governor. So, the apex Igbo body is supporting Governor Okezie Ikpeazu for a second term.”
