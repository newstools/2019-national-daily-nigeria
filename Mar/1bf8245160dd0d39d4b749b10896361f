The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was on Tuesday, March 19, prevented from collating the results of the Bauchi gubernatorial poll by a Federal High Court in Abuja presided over by one Justice Inyang Ekwo.
The court’s order was made following a suit filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Governor Mohammed Abubakar of Bauchi, and it will remain valid untill determination of the suit is made.
They asked the court for a declaration that INEC cannot review what a collation officer has cancelled, and having made a pronouncement for a supplementary election they cannot go back on it.
They also told the court that the powers of the Electoral officer having declared the election inconclusive can only be Overturn by the court.
The Independent National Electoral Commission had announced that it will no longer go ahead with a supplementary election in Bauchi state.
 Instead it will conclude with the collation of results in the remaining local government in the state. Definite hearing has been fixed for March 20th 2019.
