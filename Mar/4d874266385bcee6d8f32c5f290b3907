Juventus are prepared to offer Paulo Dybala plus cash in order to coax Liverpool into selling Mohamed Salah, claim Tuttomercatoweb.
According to the transfer gossip website in Italy, director of sport Fabio Paratici has set his sights on Egypt international Salah.
He has plenty of experience in Italy with Fiorentina and Roma before his €42m move to Liverpool in the summer of 2017.
It’s suggested Salah is seen as an alternative to first choice Federico Chiesa of Fiorentina.
Still only 26 years old, it’d take a huge offer to get Liverpool to part with Salah, so the report claims Dybala would be included as part of the deal.
Salah has scored 20 goals in 41 competitive games for the Reds this season, adding nine assists.
