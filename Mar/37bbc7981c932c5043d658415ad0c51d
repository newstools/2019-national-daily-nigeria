The All Progressives Congress, (APC) has made U-turn on its earlier decision in rejecting the date set for the supplementary election scheduled for Thursday, March 28, 2019, by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
The State Publicity Secretary, Mohammed Abdullahi, at the APC State Secretariat, Yola, enjoined all APC supporters in Adamawa State where the election is being conducted to come out and participate in the supplementary election.
Abdullahi said the party is poised to win the election and is hopeful of retaining the governorship seat in Adamawa.
The APC Publicity Secretary also debunked the claim by the PDP in Adamawa that Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano are planning to disrupt the supplementary election using thugs.
Abdullahi said the PDP in Adamawa is clearly jittery over an impending defeat.
