The prosecution team in the trial of suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) has opened its case by calling its first witness.
Proceedings were put off in the case on March 12 this year over report that the suspended CJN was ill.
Onnoghen, looking smart, is at the CCT proceedings, which commenced Monday a little over 10 am.
Lead prosecution lawyer, Aliyu Umar (SAN) informed the tribunal that he was ready with his witnesses, following which he invited his first witness after obtaining the tribunal’s permission to proceed.
The first prosecution witness, James Opala, a Senior Investigation Officer of the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), has been invited to the witness box to tell all he knows about the case.
