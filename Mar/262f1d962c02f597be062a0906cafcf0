A coalition of youth organisations in Delta State has admonished President Muhammadu Buhari to refrain from mass deployment of the military officers for the governorship and assembly elections in Delta State.
The coalition under the umbrella of Delta State Ethnic Nationalities, warned that mass deployment of Army and other security operatives to the state could scare people away and cause votersâ€™ apathy.
Of more concern to the Coalition is the temptation of interference with the electoral process by the military in the interest of their principals, including the President, himself, and subvert the will of the people. Thus, the group warned against interference with the electoral process and the need to ensure hitch-free elections in the state. Leaders of the coalition called on the people of the state to come out in good numbers and cast their votes to choose their leaders for the next four years during the elections.
