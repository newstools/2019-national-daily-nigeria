Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has blasted the Residential Electoral Commissioner, REC, of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Bayelsa State over the 63 missing card readers in the state. The governor noted that the announcement by the Bayelsa State INEC REC that 63 card readers were missing after the presidential and national assembly elections in the state was a slap on the commission.
The Bayelsa Governor at a meeting with all political appointees in Yenagoa, noted that INEC disregarded its guidelines to announce results in some parts of the state despite all the reported cases of irregularities in the last presidential and national assembly elections.
The governor stated that he has no problem with the deployment of security operatives to the state so long as they abide by the rules of their engagement.
