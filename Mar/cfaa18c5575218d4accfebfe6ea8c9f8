The Confederation of Africa Football has moved Super Eagles dead rubber AFCON 2019 qualifier against Seychelles from March 13, 2019 to March 22, 2019 in Asaba, Delta State, National Daily gathered.
The shift was believed to ensure the Gernot Rohr lads loosen up before their international friendly match against Egypt on March 26.
Meanwhile, the team’s head coach has stated that the coaching crew and the Technical Department of the Nigeria Football Federation will only invite the fittest and in form players for the games between Nigeria and Seychelles and Egypt in March in Asaba, the Delta State capital.
Rohr insisted that the best crop of players would be invited.
He said: “We will invite the fittest players in the next games against Seychelles and Egypt and the best ones will play.
“We will base our invite on what they are doing with their clubs and we know what they did with us and we are not forgetting it.”
