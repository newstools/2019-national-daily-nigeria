Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State in appreciation of the Court of Appeal judgment in Abuja, has expressed his readiness to cooperate with the opposition in the running the affairs of the state. The governor, therefore, extended a hand of fellowship to the opposition after the Court of Appeal affirmed his victory in the 2018 governorship election.
Fayemi appealed to political opponents to work with him to move Ekiti forward. He said that he has put in place, policies and programmes to check under development, promising he would complete projects initiated by his predecessor.
The appeal on Thursday upheld the judgement of the Ekiti State Governorship Tribunal affirming Fayemi as the duly elected governor of Ekiti State.
