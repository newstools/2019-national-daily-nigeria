Says no crisis in YPP


 The newly elected senator, Ifeanyi Ubah, for Anambra South, has refuted reports that he has defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); he, however, admitted he is still ‘caucusing’.
Ubah noted that he is “caucusing” with the APC, but has not joined the party; explaining that ‘caucusing’ in parliamentary terms means to work with people in harmony.
“I am still with the YPP; we do not have a crisis in my party, so, why would I leave the party? Although the APC Chairman introduced me as a potential APC incoming senator during a dinner I attended, but it is normal for chairmen of parties to do that,” Ubah explained.
“The Uba brothers are challenging the result of the election in court.
“I am caucusing with the party because I cannot be a loner at the Senate.
“It’s either I move with the opposition or the ruling party, and I chose the ruling party, but it doesn’t mean I have joined them,” Ubah said.
Adams Oshiomole, APC National Chairman, on Monday night said that the senator-elect of the Young Peoples Party (YPP) had dumped the party for the APC.
