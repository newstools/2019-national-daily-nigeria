The Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, says it has intercepted credible intelligence of a fresh plot by APC chieftains in Kano and Sokoto with the full support of Adams Oshiomhole to depose the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa ’ad Abubakar III, and the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II
The party made this allegation on Tuesday accusing chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Sokoto and Kano in collaboration with the party’s national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, of being behind the plots.
The first National spokesman of the coalition, Imo Ugochinyere, who stated this in a statement on Tuesday, explained that the move to remove the two leaders was because they refused to bow to pressure to take sides in the supplementary governorship elections in Kano and Sokoto states.
“We are alerting Nigerians to the plot and threats by the leaders of the All Progressives Congress to depose the revered Sultan of Sokoto and the Emir of Kano for refusing to bow to pressure to take sides in the supplementary governorship elections in Kano and Sokoto states.
“The grouse of the leaders of the ruling party is that the respected traditional rulers refused to intervene and interfere to galvanise support for the sinking APC in Sokoto and Kano states.
“Leaders of the APC are accusing the monarchs of allegedly taking sides with the Peoples’ Democratic Party and hence they have hatched a plot that if the traditional rulers do not help them to win the people’s support and they succeed to manipulate the election, that they will dethrone the respected traditional rulers from the thrones of their forefathers.
“We make bold to say that this is a lie from the pit of hell .The Emir and Sultan are rather appealing for calm and for the will of the people to be respected.
“Leaders of the ruling party are boasting and threatening that if they win, they will force them out by setting up state House of Assembly panel to indict them for corruption and force them out using presidential support. They are also considering the use of the CJN option against these respected monarchs,” he said.
