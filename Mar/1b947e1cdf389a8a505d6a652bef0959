Mr Mike Igini, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Akwa Ibom, on Friday said that the burning of its Local Government Area Office in the state would not stop Saturday’s polls.
N D recalls that hoodlums on Friday set fire on the INEC office in Ibesikpo/Asutan local government area of Akwa Ibom.
Reacting to the incident, Igini said that the heinous act would not deter the commission from carrying out its duties, as most of the sensitive materials for the conduct of the elections were still intact.
The REC, who went on on-the-spot assessment of the incident, was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) as saying: “there is no going back on the March 9 elections in Akwa Ibom.
“Election will hold as scheduled, no matter the plot.”
Igini revealed that some Card Readers, electricity generators, computers and other office equipment were burnt.
Narrating how the incident occurred, INEC Director of Public Affairs in the state, Mr Don Etukudoh, said the fire started at about 3:00 a.m on Friday.
According to him, an explosive device was thrown into the building which ripped the roof open and substantial damage done to the wall with several card readers burnt.
“From our findings, the place was attacked with explosives because we noticed huge damage done to the walls and the roof completely shattered.
