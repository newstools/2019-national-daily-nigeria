Anthony Joshua could face Tyson Fury before the end of the year, the Gypsy King’s trainer Ben Davison revealed.
Fury was expected to take on WBC Champion Deontey Wilder for a rematch after their last bout in December ended in a draw, but both camps have been far from reaching an agreement.
Fury has decided to face Tom Schwarz, while Wilder opted to defend his title against Dominic Breazeale later this year.
However, Fury’s promoter Bob Arum recently claimed a rematch with Wilder is unlikely before 2020 and Davison believes a fight with Joshua could be an option this year.
“At the end of the day, they were trying to negotiate with Wilder’s team, it didn’t look like we were going to be able to get them on our platform right away so we couldn’t afford to sit still and we had to get something done.”
“I think potentially there could be more of a chance, don’t hold me to it, of Tyson and Joshua at the end of the year.”
Joshua will defend his IBF, WBO, and WBA title against Jarell Miller in Madison Square Garden in New York on June first.
