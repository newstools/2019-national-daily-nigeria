Nigerian User Experience Designer, Gideon Oladimeji, is taking a huge career leap. Writing on his Twitter page, the Lagos-based designer announced he is joining global software company Automattic. He joins the team as the latest Product Designer.
The switch to Automattic is a huge career move for Gideon. For one thing, Automattic is a multibillion dollar company with a host of products. The company owns and operates WordPress, the worldâ€™s most used content management software. WordPress is used by more than a third of all websites on the internet, including CNN, Punch, the Guardian, among others.
Automattic also runs other products like WooCommerce, a popular tool for ecommerce. Automattic has a host of other lesser known products under its belt too some of which include Gravatar, Akismet, VideoPress and PollDaddy.
As a product designer, Gideon could have the opportunity to work on any or all of these products at Automattic. This is a pretty huge leap for Gideon whose career history, according to LinkedIn, only began in 2017.
He started off working as Lead UX Designer at Brindocorp, a Lagos based company. After a year and two months at the company, Gideon moved on to Dynamic Nest Algorithm, a Ghanaian based company.
But before his latest career announcement, Gideon worked as a UX designer at Zone Tech Park in Lagos.
We wish him well on his new career journey.
