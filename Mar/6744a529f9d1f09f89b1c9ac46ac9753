The Peoples’ Democratic Party says it has uncovered the All Progressives Congress alleged plans to rig the supplementary elections scheduled for this Saturday in six states of the federation.
The party alleged that it has Intel that the APC is moving huge sums of money in the attempt to bribe officials of INEC to manipulate the electoral process.
According to a statement by the spokesman of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP is ready to “confront, resist and dismantle all rigging machinery” in a bid to consolidate on its already established victory in the March 23 supplementary governorship elections.
Ologbondiyan however noted that all ‘ignoble schemes’ are already known and that the party is standing shoulder to shoulder with the people to support them in defending their votes.
“Our structure and followership in Sokoto, Kano, Adamawa, Plateau, Bauchi and Benue states have been fully rallied at all levels of polling and collation process to resist any attempt by anybody to manipulate,” the party stressed.
Ologbodiyan said the PDP will do everything in its power to ensure that Saturday’s supplementary polls set to take place in some states are not rigged or disrupted in any way.
