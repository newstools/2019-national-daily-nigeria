Minister of Transportation and the leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in South-South, Chibuike Amaechi, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission of bias.

Amaechi, who voted at his unit 14, ward 8, Ubima Community, Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State described the process as peaceful.

He however claimed that the Residence Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state is working to deliver the governor of the state.

He commended the security agencies for adequate mobilisation, noting that this is the first time people of the state are voting without fear or intimidation.

Meanwhile, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has expressed optimism that he was going to win this Saturday’s governorship election in the state.

He also accused the military of being responsible for the low turn-out of electorate in the oil rich state.

He stated this in a tweet on his Twitter handle.

“The way the military acted discouraged people from turning up.  The role of the military is to provide security.  But it is unfortunate that they directly participate. Police have role in the elections. The military appears to have taken over police duties.

“For now, we are satisfied and confident that we will win this election very well.  We are not afraid. We don’t know how many Local Government Areas they can manipulate.

“But with reports we are getting, even though they are trying to be funny, we shall win.

“We are hoping that it will continue to be like this. Sometimes, the voting goes on smoothly, but the main thing is at the Collation Centres,” Wike wote.
