As the governorship and House of Assembly elections were rated to be peaceful in Oyo State, fillers from polling units across the state showed that turnout of eligible voters was very low.

The election was also characterized by vote buying and political campaigns at some polling units.

At ward 9, unit 10, Oluokun Compound, where the candidate of All Progressive Congress, APC, voted, thugs invaded the entire area smoking India hemp and alcohol and vowing that they would not allow candidates of other parties including Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to cast their votes.

At a point when it was glaring that they have become nuisance, some soldiers had to disperse them.

However counting of votes has started across the state.

So far, there are reporte that Peoples Democratic Party, PDP is leading the governorship poll in some of the polling units where results have been released.

For instance, Governor Abiola Ajimobi lost his unit to PDP with PDP garnering 145 and APC having 122. Also in Ibadan south West ward 9 unit 1, has PDP 82 and APC 35. In Ibadan South West, PDP has 149 and APC has 112
