Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), says reports of massive bloodshed, violent activities of armed thugs and sporadic shooting of voters during the exercise was a manifestation of President Muhammadu Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) party body language.

First national spokesman of the group Imo Ugochinyere, stated this in a statement on Saturday.

“We are calling for an immediate halt of the exercise because what is ongoing in Kano State cannot be described as an election but a bloody vampire ceremony.

“The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) must put an end to this unnecessary shedding of blood by putting an immediate end to the exercise.

“It is regrettable that the state had been taken over by armed thugs who are busy shooting voters in the name of election and killing anything standing on their way.

“These thugs armed with sophisticated weapons took over accreditation and voting and murdered party agents.

“These shameful acts are physical manifestations of the body language of President Muhammadu Buhari and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC),” the statement read.

Incumbent Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, who entered into the supplementary election trailing behind the PDP candidate, is now leading following the results announced so far.
