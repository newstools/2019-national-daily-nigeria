Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has protested the showing some persons caught thumb-printing ballot papers during the presidential and national Assembly elections. The Governor demanded the Inspector General of Police as well as the Director General of the State Security Service, SSS, to apprehend those involved in the video showing thumb printing of ballot papers during Saturday’s presidential and national assembly elections.
Ayade in a media interaction after the State Security Council meeting at the Government house, Calabar, said that the intention of the perpetrators was not only criminal but designed to paint a bad image as well as reduce the credibility of elections in Cross River State.
While calling on the Inspector General of Police and the Director General of the State Security Services to fish out the perpetrators of the fraudulent act, Ayade said the video was ‘cooked’ to embarrass the state.
The governor urged the public to disregard the video, which was not only politically motivated but intended to hurt his re-election slated for March 9, 2019.
Governor Ayade assured Nigerians that those who staged that video will soon be apprehended with assurances of safety and secure environment during the forthcoming governorship polls.
