President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been warned on the need not to meddle with the governorship supplementary elections billed to hold in six states, in the interest of the nation.
The warning was issued by Lagos Central senatorial candidate of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Adesunbo Onitiri, who said in a statement that the country is presently sitting atop a time bomb.
According to him, the ruling party should not use the Osun template to rig elections in the six states including; Bauchi, Adamawa, Kano, Plateau, Benue and Rivers.
“I wish to implore all patriotic Nigerians and lovers of democracy, including the international community to prevail on Buhari to let the votes of the people count for once. We cannot afford another civil war in this country.
Onitiri also added that Nigeria is presently sitting on a time bomb and any attempt to manipulate the outcome of the election result may set the country on fire.
“Nigeria is greater than any individual or office holder. We must always bear this in mind. INEC should maintain neutrality in this election and keep the little credibility that remains,” he said.
