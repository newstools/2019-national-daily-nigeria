All Progressives Congress (APC) has asked former Abia State governor, Orji Uzor Kalu, and his colleagues from South East in the Senate to forget getting the position of Deputy President of the Senate.

According to the party’s national publicity secretary, Yekini Nabena, the Igbo people of South East after rejecting President Muhammadu Buhari to vote for Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) during the 2019 presidential election have no reason to be demanding for the position.

He stated this in response to a statement by an incoming first time senator, Kalu, from Abia State, who argued that for the sake of fairness the APC should zone Deputy Senate President position to South East.

He had vowed that he would be disobedient to his party APC, to contest and lobby for the position should the party decide to zone the position to any other zone outside the South East.

But Nabena responding in an interview with Daily Independent, said Kalu “can contest for the position of Senate President. But the issue is, can he win? Nobody is stopping him from contesting. Igbo people always play themselves out. So, Kalu cannot blame APC.”

Speaking further he said, “He (Kalu) should blame his own people from the South-East. He should blame them because they don’t know how to play politics. They play politics like a one-way thing. They all voted for Atiku in the presidential election. So, now that Atiku lost, who will help people like Orji Kalu? 99.9 percent of them followed Atiku.

“So, what is Kalu crying for? He should go back to his people and educate them on how politics is played especially at the national level. They should play 50-50. If this one didn’t work, the other can work.

“So, Orji Uzor Kalu must go back to his people and educate them because he himself is not worthy to be Senate President or Deputy Senate President. So, if he wants to contest, he can do so. Nobody is stopping him. But I know that he cannot win.”
