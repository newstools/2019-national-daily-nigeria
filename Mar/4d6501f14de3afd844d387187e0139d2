The APC national chairman Adams Oshiomhole has said the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar is never destined to rule Nigeria.
He said this at a press conference while reacting to the Peoples Democratic Party candidate’s rejection of the election result.
“It borders on arrogance that our future is tied on his presidency. Atiku is destined never to be president of Nigeria,” Mr Oshiomhole said.
According to him, Leadership is about character.
“Atiku’s desperation is so obvious that in 2003, he challenged his own boss, President Olusegun Obasanjo, not to do a second term.”
Mr Abubakar’s fourth attempt on 18 years failed in the just concluded presidential election in which incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari emerged winner with over 15 million votes.


Atiku is set to challenge the victory in court.
