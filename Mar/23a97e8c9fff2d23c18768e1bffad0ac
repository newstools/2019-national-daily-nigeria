The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said that the commission is not aware of any raid on the farm allegedly linked to the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen.
Operatives of the commission, a cameraman and policemen were said to have raided Justice Onnoghen’s farms located in the Masaka area of Nasarawa State at about 3.00pm on Saturday and allegedly searched the entire premises for more than three hours.
EFCC’s spokesman, Tony Orilade, was said to have refuted being aware of any search by operatives of the agency on the property reportedly linked to the suspended CJN.
The commission also said to have dismissed reports of raiding Justice Onnoghen’s residence.
The anti-graft agency said it never went to the CJN’s house.
There were also reports about an invitation from the EFCC to the CJN, however, the EFCC said it did not extend any such invitation.
While describing these reports as ‘fake news’, the commission told Nigerians to disregard all unfounded claims and be rest assured that the commission will fight corruption in line with the agency’s mandate.
Justice Onnoghen is facing six charges bordering on failure to declare his assets and operating a domiciliary account, among other charges.
