Gernot Rohr has said the Super Eagles did the job of winning their 2019 AFCON qualifying group after edging past Seychelles 3-1, but their play was also littered by many mistakes, National Daily gathered.
Nigeria won Group E with 13 points from six matches on the back of the home win over Seychelles in Asaba.
“We did the job as we wanted to win the game and finish top of our group, which is important for our FIFA ranking and the draw for the AFCON,” Rohr said after the win over The Pirates of Seychelles.
“But there were a lot of mistakes in our build-up, we have to improve.
“I also saw some interesting players. It was good to see the players after four months.”
The coach admitted “individual” mistake by goalkeeper Francis Uzoho gifted Seychelles an equalizer before half time.
Rohr further said Seychelles lined up a completely different team from the one they beat 3-0 at their home ground last year.
“We knew it would be a difficult game because they were not the same team, they brought seven new players.
“They defended and so we had to attack them from the wings.”
