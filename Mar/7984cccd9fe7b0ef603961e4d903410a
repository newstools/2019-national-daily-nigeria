Some members and supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ogun State, have aligned with the governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement, APM, Adekunle Akinlade, for the Saturday, March 9 governorship election in the state.
It was gathered that a faction of the PDP loyal to Ladi Adebutu who lost the PDP ticket to Buruji Kashamu at the court, declared its support for Adekunle Akinlade of the APM.
The camps of Adebutu and Aknlade signed a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, on the sharing of political positions after the elections to effect the alliance.
The PDP factional State Chairman, Ladi Adebutu, acknowledged that Nigeria’s constitution allows for freedom of association, which they have exercised.
Akinlade is being sponsor by Governor Ibikunle Amosun to provide opportunity for the Yewa peoples in Ogun South to produce governor for the first time since 1999. This decision pitched Amosiun against APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who is sponsoring Dapo Abiodun from Ogun East for governor of the state in the March 9 elections. Abiodun is sharing the Ogun East with Senator Buruji Kashamu, candidate of the PDP.
