Ajax director of football Marc Overmars has insisted that Matthijs de Ligt has not yet decided his future amid suggestions that the centre-back has already agreed a deal with Barcelona.
De Ligt, 19, is widely regarded as one of the best young defenders in European football and has already made 100 appearances for Ajax in all competitions.
A number of clubs – including Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester City – have been credited with an interest in the 13-time Netherlands international ahead of this summer’s transfer window.
However, according to Overmars, De Ligt is yet to decide where he will play his football next season.
“I love Barcelona but I do not know what he will do,” Overmars told TV3.
De Ligt, who wears the captain’s armband for Ajax, has a contract with his Amsterdam club until June 2021.
The Dutchman is currently in Spain preparing for his team’s Champions League last-16 second leg against Real Madrid.
