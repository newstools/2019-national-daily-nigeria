The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in Chad says the leadership of the Boko Haram terrorists group is currently overwhelmed and in disarray.
Col, Timothy Antigha, the Chief of Military Public Information of the MNJTF, confirmed this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Tuesday.
Antigha said the group was overwhelmed after a sustained air and land attacks in the ongoing “Operation `Yancin Tafki’’ in the Lake Chad region.
He also said ex-fighters, who were “receiving humane attention divulged that morale and fighting spirit of the group’s fighters is very low.’’
Antigha further quoted ex-fighters as saying that the development is as a result of growing insecurity and inability to replenish stranded fighters in the islands with food, medicine and ammunition.
