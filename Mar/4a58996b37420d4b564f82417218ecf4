It may seem like Eden Hazard’s departure to Real Madrid this summer is a foregone conclusion now, but it’s not over until it’s over. And if there is a man who knows a thing or two about not giving up hope and fighting to the end, it’s Didier Drogba.
The man who recently celebrated his 41st birthday, in part, by taking in Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge does not believe in such defeatist notions. In fact, he’s actively urging Hazard to reconsider any decision he may have made to be just another Real Madrid Galáctico, and instead write his own story at Chelsea by becoming a club legend just like Didier himself.
“Why [should he leave]? I think he can have this here in Chelsea
”You know, I had many opportunities to leave and I decided to stay to make my own story and win the Champions League here. I think he’s got a chance to make his own story.
”This club is still young and we need people like him to improve the quality in terms of Champions League trophies in the room, he can help us. I will be very happy if he stays here, but if he goes to Madrid, good luck to him.”
Drogba was successful in swaying Hazard’s decision in favour of Chelsea at least once before, when he persuaded Hazard to join the Blues back in 2012. Of course, Drogba’s persuasion was also helped by the fact that Chelsea had managed to win the Champions League that year.
This time however, Chelsea are not guaranteed to even be in the Champions League, let alone win it. Meanwhile, Real have Zidane back as manager, straight off of Eden’s childhood bedroom walls.
Ultimately, it’s the former reason rather than the latter which will likely make the biggest difference. Hazard is 28 years old. The next long-term contract he signs will likely be his last and final significant one. He wants to win the Champions League. Chelsea seem to be trending the opposite way at the moment.
