Manchester United caretaker manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on Friday, confirmed that forward, Marcus Rashford, is set to start his side’s Premier League clash with Southampton on Saturday at Old Trafford.

Solskjaer also said that forward, Anthony Martial, will miss United clash against Southampton.

According to him, the France international has not yet recovered from a groin injury.

“He (Rashford) still felt it Wednesday night, but he’ll be ready. I’ll probably start him,” Solskjaer was quoted by Manchester Evening News as saying at a pre-match press conference.

“You do have a plan, but then you get suspensions and injuries. That one injury or one suspension might change the whole dynamic. It’s a matter of seeing who’s available now.

“It’s the last session today but we’re not going take any risks. Maybe Anthony, but it might just be a few more days before he’s ready. So, probably the squad will look similar to what it did on Wednesday,” Solskjaer added.
