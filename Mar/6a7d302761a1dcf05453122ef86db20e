England captain Harry Kane says he wants to play as a kicker in the NFL.
The Tottenham striker, a New England Patriots fan, watched them win a sixth Super Bowl in Atlanta in February.
“The desire to play in the NFL is real. It’s something that in 10 or 12 years I definitely want to try,” 25-year-old Kane told pressmen.
“If you play in the Premier League and the World Cup and you then play in the NFL, would you then be considered one of the greatest sportsmen ever?”
Kane, who has won 37 England caps, won the Golden Boot at the 2018 World Cup and is Tottenham’s top scorer this season with 20 goals.
In Atlanta, he met Tom Brady, the 41-year-old Patriots quarterback who has won a record six Super Bowls.
“We’ve had a similar path being doubted when we were younger – maybe not being the best athletes as kids,” Kane, who had several spells out on loan before finally breaking into Tottenham’s first team, said.
“At the time, it gave me a real boost to say, look, anything is possible. If you have that self-belief and that drive and that hunger, you can do it.”
“I have one eye on it but I’m focused on football first. In 10 years or so we can focus on the NFL.”
