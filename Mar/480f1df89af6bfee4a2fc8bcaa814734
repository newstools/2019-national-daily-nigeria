A total of 15 councilors of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kwara State after the defeat of the PDP in the presidential and national assembly elections in Kwara Sate.
The councilors from Moro and Ilorin South Local Government areas said they were defecting as the people they are representing have decided to pitch a tent with the APC.
After the meeting with APC leaders in Kwara State, the defected Councilors said that they were elected on the platform of the APC before their defection to the PDP, hence, their decision to return to their original party.
One of the APC leaders in the state, Alimi Abdulrahman, who received the defectors, said it is a welcome development towards good governance.
Kwara State has 193 councilors across the 193 wards in the state.
