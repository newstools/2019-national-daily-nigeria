The Kaduna State Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has raised alarm over the outcome of the presidential and National Assembly elections which the party said was marred by malpractice and irregularities, declaring that the battle line is drawn.
PDP State Chairman in Kaduna, Hassan Hyat, accused both the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, of conniving to rob the people of their mandate.
Hyat said the card readers used in most PDP strongholds were designed to slow down the process or deliberately malfunction to halt activities so as to work against the opposition party.
The Kaduna State PDP Chairman also said that apart from shortfalls of electoral materials in some polling units, those recruited for the elections as ad hoc staff were APC appointees.
The PDP, therefore, called on security agencies to abide by the rules of engagement; it also wants the INEC to be transparent and fair to all political parties in the elections.
