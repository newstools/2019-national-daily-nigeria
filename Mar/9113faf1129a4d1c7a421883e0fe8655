Recently  former U-17 striker, Victor Osimhen  got a hat-trick against Libya U23,this is what he told National Daily after the game .
How  did it feel scoring three goals to ensure Nigeria qualify to the next round of the U23 AFCON qualifiers?
It’s a great feeling. It was important that we got the big win to qualify for the next round of the qualifiers.I am happy my three and the assist were enough for the team to get the well-deserved win. I just want to build on this momentum and keep on going.
Nigeria did not open scoring till the 33rd minute, what  was  on your mind ?
I was still optimistic, knowing fully well we were ready for the game. Kudos to the fans, the technical crew too and most especially to our head coach (Imama Amapakabo), what he said to us before the blast of the whistle was a key for us to get this win.
Were you under pressure to deliver after you were drafted from the Super Eagles to the U23s?
No ,no,no!!!  I wasn’t at all the head coach spoke with me and I was pleased to accept the call, I wanted  to contribute my own quota to the success of the team, to help my teammates. I was happy for this platform given to me.
The coach really believed in me and I am happy I was able to justify this invitation.
It now appears that Osimhen is  knocking on the door of African Cup of Nations come June?
I don’t know  yet, I just want to keep up my present  form. I will go back to my club  and keep working hard to improve more and by the special grace of God I will get there.
Against long list of clubs are now  jostling for your signature, the likes of AC Milan and PSG in a season you have scored 12 goals and provided seven assists in Belgium.
I want to believe it is down to my mentality as a person and a professional. And with the help of God I will keep pushing harder and I know more teams are going to come, I hope to make the right choice. I would say to the set back I experienced, I count it as joy.
