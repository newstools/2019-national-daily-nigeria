The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has continued its public campaign to educate telecommunication subscribers in the country on better ways to resolve complaints they have.
The industry regulator, in a series of posts recently reiterated that “network providers have an obligation to keep consumers abreast of the progress made on the resolution of their complaints up to the point of final resolution”.
Recall that the Commission, in 2016, announced a measure to combat unsolicited text messages from telecommunications networks to subscribers.
