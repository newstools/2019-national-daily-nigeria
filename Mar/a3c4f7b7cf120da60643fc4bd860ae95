The Osun State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Abuja has reserved judgement in the suit filed by Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the victory of the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in last year’s election in Osun State

At proceedings on Thursday, the tribunal, led by Ibrahim Sirajo, having heard arguments from both petitioners and defendants said the two parties would be informed of the date the judgment would be delivered 48 hours prior to the yet-to-be-picked date.

Adeleke is challenging the outcome of the September 2018 election where the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Oyetola as the winner.

The poll was conducted on September 22, 2019 before a supplementary poll held on September 27, 2018 where Oyetola was announced to have scored the highest number of votes.

But the petitioners alleged that the election was characterised with irregularities including massive rigging and vote buying and urged the court to nullify Oyetola’s victory and also declare the Candidate of the PDP winner of that election having allegedly scored the highest number of votes.

Joined in the matter are the Governor, APC and INEC who were represented by Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), Chief Akin Olujinmi (SAN), and Lasco Pwahomdi respectively.
