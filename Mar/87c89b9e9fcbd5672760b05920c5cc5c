HJK Helsinki have said they are delighted to sign Nigeria defender Elderson Echiejile.
“He’s an experienced defender and he will add a lot of value to the team,” said coach Mika Lekosuo, National Daily gathered.
Free agent Elderson Echiejile, 31, has agreed a year’s deal with the Finnish club after trials.
Elderson terminated his contract with AS Monaco by mutual consent last year.
His previous clubs include Sporting Braga (Portugal), Rennes (France), Sivasspor (Turkey), Standard Liege, Cercle Brugge (Belgium).
The leftback has been capped 59 times by Nigeria and was on the squad to last year’s World Cup in Russia.
He has also represented Nigeria at U17 and U20 levels.
