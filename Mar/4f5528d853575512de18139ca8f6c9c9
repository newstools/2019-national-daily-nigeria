…to miss three matches
Lucas Torreira has been banned for three games after the Football Association rejected Arsenal’s appeal over his red card against Tottenham.
Torreira, on as a half-time substitute, saw red in the fifth minute of stoppage time, after his stud-showing follow-through caught Danny Rose high on the shin.
The 23-year-old will now miss United’s visit to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, as well as the visit of Newcastle and a trip to Everton.
The United game, in particular, looks critical, with both sides part of a race with Chelsea and Tottenham for two Champions League spots.
It was one of a number of blows for Arsenal in the 1-1 north London derby draw, with Harry Kane equalising for Tottenham through a controversial penalty after Aaron Ramsey had opened the scoring.
They still had a chance to win the derby late on, when Davinson Sanchez felled Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but the Gabonese saw his spot-kick saved by Hugo Lloris in the 90th minute.
Torreira will next be available for the trip to Watford on April 15.
