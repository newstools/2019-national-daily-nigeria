Nigeria is committed to ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls,  Ambassador/Permanent Representative to the UN, Prof. Tijjani Bande, said.
Bande stated this at a side event organised by the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre in New York on “Promoting Social Security for African Women in Conflict”.
Bande, represented by Mr Alwan Abdussalam, Senior Counselor/Focal Point for Nigeria on Counter-Terrorism at the United Nation, also pledged Nigeria’s commitment to end poverty and ensure prosperity for all.
According to him, however, ending poverty and ensuring prosperity for all could only be achieved if development initiatives consider the unique needs, knowledge and potentials of women and girls.
The Nigerian envoy called on governments, the private sector, non-governmental organisations and development partners to recognise the vital role of women in national development.
He stressed the need to eliminate barriers to women’s participation in peace-related activities and to ensure their full inclusion during formulation and implementation of early-warning systems as well as in peace-building efforts at all levels.
He further stated the need to continue to advocate for gender equality and women’s empowerment to elevate women’s voices as well as point out the role of women in countering violent extremism and terrorism.
Mr Auwal Musa, the Executive Director of CISLAC, stated that the event was to identify the central needs required for full social security and human development, attainment of rights and empowerment for African women and especially women in conflict.
Musa stressed the need to keep the issues of women globally and regionally on the front burner of international discourse.
