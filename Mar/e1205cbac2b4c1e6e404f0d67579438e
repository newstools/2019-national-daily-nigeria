The Court of Appeal sitting in Sokoto, Sokoto State, on Monday set aside decision of Zamfara State High Court that allowed the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to field candidate for the Zamfara State Governorship election which held on March 9. The Appellate Court maintained the trial court failed to carry out proper evaluation of the evidence before it, thereby, taking a decision in error. The court, accordingly, nullified the participation of the ruling APC in the governorship election which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the APC candidate winner.
The Appeal Court judgment implies that the INEC may withhold issuing certificate of return to the APC governorship candidate who was declared winner of the election.
