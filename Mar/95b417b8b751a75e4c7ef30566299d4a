Bonus sir  Dortmund say Jadon Sancho is going nowhere this summer amid continued links with Manchester United.
Senior officials at the German club have told Sportsmail that the winger, who is currently on England duty, will ‘definitely’ be playing in the Bundesliga next season.
Sancho is hoping to earn his fourth England cap against the Czech Republic at Wembley on Friday night and has been impressing during training at St George’s Park.
The 18-year-old’s stock has steadily risen during his first full campaign as a professional, with nine goals and 13 assists for Lucien Favre’s side.
Dortmund are already losing Christian Pulisic to Chelsea for £58million and club sources claim that no amount of money would see them part with another star player.
Sancho says he is happy in Germany and is not agitating for a move.
Paris Saint-Germain are also said to be interested in signing him.
England are not planning to call Sancho up for June’s Under 21 European Championship in Italy, in a move designed to allow other youngsters a chance on the big stage.
