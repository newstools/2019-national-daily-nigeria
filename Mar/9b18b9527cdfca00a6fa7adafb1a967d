Former Portuguese midfielder Deco refuses to summon Cristiano Ronaldo to the Seleçao, while Portugal begins Friday’s qualifying for Euro 2020 against Ukraine.
Deco (former Portuguese international, 75 caps): “Portugal won the Euro. Everyone asks the same question: Can Portugal win something important? But Portugal has won something important in the past because they have a lot of good players and a good coach. Everyone said that Portugal was just Cristiano Ronaldo, but they proved it was not true. They have a good team. Of course, you can not say that you do not need Cristiano. It’s crazy to say that. Of course, if Cristiano is here, Portugal will be stronger. They did very well, but with Cristiano it would be different, that’s for sure. “
