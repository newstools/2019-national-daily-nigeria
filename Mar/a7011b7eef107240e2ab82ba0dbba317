Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to host the 2019 edition of Budget Seminar at the Eko Hotels and Suites Victoria Island, Lagos.
The theme of the event is “Budgets, Elections and Capital Markets: Risks and Opportunities in 2019”.
The seminar, the third of its kind by the SEC, which is scheduled for Tuesday March 19, 2019, will bring together experts with professional, policy and academic background in order to deliberate extensively on the implication of the budget to the capital market in Nigeria.
Also to be examined are the ways in which the capital market could contribute more meaningfully to the growth and recovery process the budget is intended to promote.
The Commission’s Budget Seminar Series has been established as a forum for evaluating the connection between the Nigerian capital market and the annual Federal Government Budget. A major aim is to identify how the capital market can contribute to and in turn benefit from the budget and its implementation.
The Commission as the host of this event, gathers subject matter experts with incisive knowledge and experience on various economic activities to deliberate extensively, with the aim of enlightening participants on the area of focus for the seminar.
In addition to the learning of the day, which will equip participants, a communique will be drafted and forwarded as the capital market inputs to the appropriate government and private institutions.
Presenter at the event is Dr. Afolabi Olowookere of the SEC, Panelists include Hajara Adeola of Lotus Capital Limited, Toyin Sanni of Emerging Africa Capital Group, Patience Oniha Director General of Debt Management Office and Prof. Olu Ajakaiye of Africa Centre for Shared Capacity Development Building.
