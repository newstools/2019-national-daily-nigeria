André Onana, Cameroonian Ajax goalkeeper who was formed in La Masia, has shown his joy in the program Tú Dirás, of RAC1, for having eliminated Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League and has spoken of the possibility of returning One day at Barça, a hypothesis that can not be ruled out if Cillessen changed the air at the end of this season.
“If I go back to Barça, I’ll be happy again. I am not afraid to compete and if I can compete with someone bigger than me, better, I will learn more. Time will tell, now I’m Ajax player, I’m happy here and I want to win many titles in Holland, “he said.
From 1-4 at the Bernabéu said “we know we have made history, we trusted and we knew that if we moved the ball, Madrid would suffer, and that with a goal the game would open. Only with 1-4 did I think it was done. It was the happiest day since I’ve been in Ajax. Madrid is not eliminated every day, and less with 1-4 at the Bernabéu. We were prepared and went with everything to Madrid. They were confident with the 1-2 and playing the round at home. “
