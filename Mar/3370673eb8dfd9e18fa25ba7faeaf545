Danladi emphasized  that the standard operational procedures that was relied upon by the defence Counsel is full of contradictions, declaring that due to the observed contradictions, the SOP is not adopted presently because it was authored for personal interest by the past board members of the Bureau.
The tribunal held that the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses and the exhibit which is a statement admitting that Justice Onnoghen forget to update his asset declaration form is enough to call the defendant to enter his defence to clear his name
Code of Conduct Tribunal, therefore, ordered Justice Walter Onnoghen to enter his defence to clear his name.
