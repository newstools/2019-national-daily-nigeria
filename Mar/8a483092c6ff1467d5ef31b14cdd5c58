A teenage girl has been allegedly raped to death by unknown persons at Imufu community, Enugu Ezike, Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area of Enugu State.
Ngozi Eze’s  corpse was found in a bush behind Community Secondary School, Imufu.
According to her father, Ngozi had gone for her Joint Admission and Matriculations Board (JAMB) lessons in preparation for the forthcoming Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).
Her body was found several hours after her family had declared her missing.
Her father, Jonathan Eze, told the crowd that gathered in the bush where the body was found that he went back later to take her back after the lesson only to be informed that somebody had given her a lift.




“I left Township School, Ogrute and went home straight, hoping to see her but she wasn’t there. We waited till 8:00p.m. and started looking for her. She was not the type that normally socialise. We did not sleep as her telephone number was switched off. It was only this morning (Wednesday) that we got information that her body was found here.”




 
Rev. Father Johnson Nwanonenyi, the parish priest of the area, said a short prayer for the repose of her soul at the scene, amid wailing and sobbing by sympathisers, shortly before a team of police detectives took the body away for further investigation.
The police who arrived the scene said a close observation of her body showed lacerations around her neck and ankles, suggesting she must have been strangled by the rapists.
Her books and writing materials, handkerchief and shreds of her clothing were scattered around the scene.
Spokesman of Enugu police command, Superintendent Ebere Amaraizu, said they were yet to receive full report of the incident
