The All progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate for Imo state in the March 9 election, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has challenged Governor Rochas Okorocha to a popularity test in the state.

Uzodinma asked Okorocha to walk the street of Owerri with him and see if Imo residents will not stone him (Governor Okorocha) out of anger.

Uzodinma made this statement after Okorocha allegedly said the APC lost in Imo state because its candidate, Senato Hope Uzodinma, was not popular enough.

The APC governorship candidate, while reacting to Okorocha’s statement said the governor’s political career is dead and he is surprised the governor isn’t somewhere hiding in shame after he lost his bid to install his son in-law, Uche Nwosu.
Uzodinma said: “As a sitting governor he failed to win a senatorial election and got a Returning Officer to announce him winner under duress.”

“Despite all the billions he spent to stop me and the APC in the state from the results from the polling units I won the election and we will prove it.

“But Okorocha has lost his deposit and he is finished politically. He is an expert in running people down but God has punished him today. This same man worked against the APC and he has the gut to speak about others. I challenge Okorocha for a walk in the streets of Owerri if Imo people will not stone him.

“I will reclaim my mandate which Okorocha and Ihedioha stole last weekend and then i will have something to tell Okorocha.”

Meanwhile, some aggrieved members of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and former aides to Governor Rochas Okorocha, have urged Okorocha not challenge the outcome of the governorship election to prevent a violent protest by the people of the state against his government
