Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure has sentenced Seidu Adeyemi to death; he is to die by hanging for killing Khadijat Oluboyo, daughter of former deputy governor of Ondo State.
Khadijat, a final year student of the Adekunle Ajasin University (AAU), Akugba-Akoko, was found dead inside the room of Adeyemi at his residence in Oke Aro area of Akure on July 2, 2018.
The culprit was subsequently arrested and has been on prosecution since then.
The presiding judge, Justice Samuel Bola, said the evidence before the court was overwhelming. He, therefore, sentenced Bola to death by hanging. So, the culprit is expected to be a guest of the hangman very soon in the absence of appeal on the judgment or the governor of the state withholding his signatory to the death sentence for the execution of the judgement.
