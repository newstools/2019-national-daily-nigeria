Federal government must as matter of urgency check the importation of electronic waste into the country.
Electronic waste otherwise known as eWaste dumping in the country had become a cause for concern because such waste contained carcinogenic radioactive materials that could be hazardous to health.
A carcinogen is any substance, radionuclide, or radiation that is an agent directly involved in causing cancer.
This may be due to the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes.
Nigeria is an attractive destination for eWaste for many reasons including; Nigerians penchant for cheap electronic products.
Citing a recent report, Jumia Travel said that, “Nigeria dangerously consumes technologies which have 90% foreign input and a paltry 10% local input.”
Also; Nigeria has many non-performing government agencies as a result most goods brought in through Nigerian are not checked.
