An elder statesman in northern Nigeria, Abubakar Tsav, former Commissioner of Police, has called on northern leaders to intervene urgently and resolve the rift between former Governor Rabni’u Musa Kwankwaso and incumbent Governor Abdulahi Umar Ganduje in Kano State. Tsav noted that the intervention of the elders and leaders in the North would save lives of many citizens and help to restore law and order in the city.
Tsav considered open insult on leaders by youths and followers of certain political leaders as a shame and open disgrace, decrying that the action does not demonstrate proper moral enculturation of the youths.
The elder statesman from Benue State advocated an end to lawlessness in the north.
Tsav in a statement on Monday declared: “I urge our respected Northern Elders to take steps to settle the rift between Senator Musa Rabiu Kwankwaso and his friend, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.
“By this, they will not only be saving the lives of their blind and stray followers but also maintain and respect the dignity of His Royal Highness, the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Lamido Sanusi Lamido.
“What is happening in Kano, is not good enough, it is shameful and disgraceful. How can people in their right senses openly abuse and insult leaders in a most horrible pronouncement?
“This is against Islam and shows that youths involved have no morals and have not been properly brought up by their Parents and guardians.
“Enough of this lawlessness and hooliganism.”
The rift between Kwankwaso and Ganduje since the defection of Kwankwanso from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been creating tension in Kano State. The rift is being exacerbated by the presidential ambition of Kwankwaso which is being strongly opposed by Ganduje who adamantly supported the re-election of President Muhmmadu Buhari of the APC.
