After emerging senator under the platform of Young Peoples Party (YPP), Ifeanyi Ubah, has dumped the party for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
Ubah won the Anambra South senatorial election which was the only seat the new party, YPP got in the Senate within the 36 states of the federation.
He had on Friday refuted reports of plans to dump the party.
“I am not yet ready to defect from the YPP. I am still in the YPP. In party business, you can’t determine what would happen next. Sometimes you wake up and you will start seeing one problem or the other. For me today, I am in the YPP and I hope to remain in the party.
“The YPP is bringing a revolution of change to Nigeria. I must join a progressive group in the Senate since I cannot be alone. The YPP is the party to beat in this country. I won my election without the party having an office in any part of Anambra State,” Ubah had said.
