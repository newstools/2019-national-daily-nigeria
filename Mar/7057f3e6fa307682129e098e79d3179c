An Adamawa State High Court sitting in Yola has vacated an order preventing the governorship supplementary election from taking place in the state.
Judge Abdul-Azeez Waziri on March 14 restrained the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting the supplementary election in 44 polling units in the state.
The court order followed a motion ex parte filed by Movement of Restoration for Defence of Democracy, MRPD governorship candidate Mustapha Shaba.
Shaba had sued the electoral body over the omission of his party’s logo on the electoral materials used in the March 9 governorship election.
The court then ordered the indefinite postponement of the State governorship supplementary election which prevented the poll from holding last Saturday.
