The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Kaduna, Isah Ashiru, has rejected the result of the governorship election in the state. He lost to the incumbent Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, in the result declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).  El-Rufai had a total of 1,045,427 votes to emerge the winner, while Ashiru polled 814,168 votes.
Ashiru said he has substantial evidence to show that the election was manipulated. He demanded cancellation of the results, alleging gross irregularities in some local government areas of the state.
Some of the issues he raised include:

The alleged non-use of card readers in several polling units in Giwa, Birnin Gwari, Kaduna North, Igabi, Zaria, Lere, and Ikara Local Government Areas. “It is our firm belief that the non-usage of the card readers which is a violation of the electoral guidelines have rendered the results from these areas invalid.
The “clear militarisation of the electoral process in various part of the state.
 The disparity between the number of votes obtained by the APC in the presidential elections and that of the governorship elections was another cause for concern. “How could the people of Kaduna State be convinced the APC will earn more votes during the governorship elections than it got in the presidential elections.

INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner, Alhaji Kaugama Abdullahi, has confirmed receiving a petition against the outcome of the governorship poll from the PDP. Abdullahi was gathered to have ac knowledge that the PDP had requested to inspect the election materials used during the poll in the state. He said the commission had already directed its legal department to take necessary actions on the petition since the request is within the law.
