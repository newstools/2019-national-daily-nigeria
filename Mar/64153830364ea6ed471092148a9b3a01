NLC pledges to fight anti-labour policies


Workers in Ogun State on Tuesday took to the streets on wild protest after invading the State Secretariat chanting solidarity songs.
The leadership of the Organised Labour, essentially, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) was said to be holding meeting with Governor Ibikunle Amosun, for over two hours but the workers became impatient and embarked on street protest in Abeokuta, the state capital.
The workers were protesting the non-remittance of statutory deductions from workers’ salaries for pensions, cooperative, and other purposes over a period of 105 months.
They were also protested the non-utilization of the last tranche of the Paris Club refund for the payment of gratuity for both state and local government workers since 2013, despite signing a collective bargaining agreement with organized labour in Ogun State.
The workers were also protesting the refusal to pay workers at the Tai Solarin College of Education salary arrears that has accumulated for the past 10 years and now grosses to a financial liability of about N9 billion.
The Ogun State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress was also sacked by the state governor for standing firm in the defence of the rights of workers in Ogun State.
