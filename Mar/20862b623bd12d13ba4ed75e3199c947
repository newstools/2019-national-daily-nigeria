Former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Obong Victor Attah, has expressed that the 2019 Governorship and National Assembly Elections in the state were true reflection of the will and wishes of the Akwa Ibom people.
Attah noted that for the first time since 2007, the people of the state saw ballot papers and voted candidates of their choice; he encouraged other states to emulate the template used by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure free, fair and credible polls in Akwa Ibom State.
Former Governor Attah recalled that he and many voters in Akwa Ibom State could not vote in the 2015 general elections due to electoral malpractices, maintaining that Nigerians need electoral umpire that believes in testing popularity at the ballot and not a money induced umpire.
The Obong of Calabar, Ndidem Ekpo-Okon Abasi-Out, and former Christian Association of Nigeria President, Prelate Sunday Mbang, also remarked that despite the tension before and during the elections, the wish of the people prevailed with an unbiased umpire who ensured that electoral guidelines were followed.
“Despite the protests and negative reactions from the process and conduct of the 2019 general elections across the country, Akwa Ibom was seen as a state where the will of the people truly manifested through the ballot,” they declared.
