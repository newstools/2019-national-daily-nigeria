The Nigerian Air Force has denied allegations that the Force is deploying fighter jets and attack helicopters against election violence.
Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, protested in a statement that the allegations are misleading and a misrepresentation of the facts.
He noted that the Air Force is only supporting the Police to ensure the safety of lives and properties in their various locations.
“Air crafts deployed are only surveillance and intelligence platforms, and not fighter jets as implied in some quarters,” he said.
The Air Force PRO stated that the Air Force will continue to operate within the ambits of its constitutional role of defending the territorial integrity of the country and protecting the rights and liberties of all Nigerians.
