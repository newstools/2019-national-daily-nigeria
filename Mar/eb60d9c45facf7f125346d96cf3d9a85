The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Adamawa State has rejected the Thursday, March 28, 2019, date for supplementary election for the governorship race fixed by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.
The Adamawa State Organizing Secretary of the APC, Ahmed Lawan, protested the new rescheduled date in Yola after the announcement by INEC.
Lawan said the party was not consulted before the decision was reached to fix a new date for the supplementary election in Adamawa.
The Adamawa State Organizing Secretary of the APC said the scheduled date was first a rumour; he wondered why the date became feasible afterward.
However, the State Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Abdullahi Prambe, said the APC is clearly jittery of a looming defeat hence the tactical maneuver to chicken out of an electoral process that should have long been completed.
