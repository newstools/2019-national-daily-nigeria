Following the declaration of the governorship poll in Adamawa State as inconclusive, the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has requested that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declare its candidate, Umaru Fintiri as winner.





     


INEC had declared the election inconclusive after announcing results from all the 21 local government areas based on the fact that the margin of lead of 32,476 was lower than 40,998 registered voters in polling units where election was cancelled.

Fintiri had polled 367, 471 votes in the inconclusive election, while the governor, Mohammed Bindow polled 334, 995 votes.

During a press briefing addressed by a former governor of the state, Boni Haruna, in Yola on Tuesday, the PDP argued that INEC should have considered the number of voters who collected their Permanent Voter Card (PVCs) which is lower than the margin of lead rather than the total number of registered voters in the affected polling units.

“We’ve been able to establish that the number of PVCs collected by voters in the 44 PUs is 31,027. So, 31,027 are the only eligible voters in those units. If there is going to be a rerun, the 31,027 people who collected their PVCs are less than PDP’s margin of win. How then would the re-run affect the leading position of the PDP? So, there was no basis in declaring the Adamawa State governorship election inconclusive,” he said.

The party therefore rejected the declaration of the election as inconclusive, calling on INEC to rescind its decision and declare the PDP candidate, Umaru Fintiri, as the winner.
