The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, has endorsed the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate, ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in Lagos State.
Leader of the group, Uchenna Madu, explained that the victory of Agbaje would ensure unity between Igbos and Yorubas in the state.
In a statement, Madu said: “Our convictions to support the PDP candidate is for the enthronement of a Lagos state governor that will see the Igbos and other non-Yoruba as citizens of Lagos.
“We need a new government in Lagos that is not ethnic-bias or oriented with envy against Ndigbo.
“We must come out and massively and vote for the PDP candidate as a sign of solidarity to our uniqueness and consistency.
“Our business interest in Lagos, our lives and properties must be protected.”
