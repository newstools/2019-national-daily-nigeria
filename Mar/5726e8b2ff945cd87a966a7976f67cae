The All Progressives Congress (APC) has affirmed the endorsement of Senator Ahmed Lawan as the President of the Senate in the 9th National Assembly, saying that there is no going back on the nomination of the senator.
APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Isa-Onilu, in Abuja, emphasized the need for party members to adhere strictly to party directives.
The ruling APC also told the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) not to have the ambition of contesting the seat of the Senate President, adding that voting may just be an exercise in futility.
On whether or not the Minister of Transportation and Director General of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, Rotimi Amaechi, is involved in anti-party activities in Rivers State, the APC National Publicity Secretary admitted that the party has got the right to support any party of its choice.
The APC reiterated the party remains resolute in fulfilling the promises it made to Nigerians within the ambit of the law.
