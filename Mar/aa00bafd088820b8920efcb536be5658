The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, on Sunday suspended the governorship election in Rivers State till further notice.
National Commissioner, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, said the decision was taken after reports of widespread disruption of the elections conducted on Saturday.
Okoye said the commission is concerned about the credibility of the process due to violence in some polling units, abduction of staff, and destruction of electoral materials and result sheets.
The Commissioner said that a fact-finding committee has been established to assess the situation in the state and report back within 48 hours.
The Commission noted that the suspension does not affect house of Assembly elections.
