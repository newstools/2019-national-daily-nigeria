PDP’s  presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar was in Abeokuta where he had an hour’s meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday .
The former vice president arrived at Obasanjo Presidential Library around 1pm, according to Obasanjo’s media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, confirmed the meeting.
Akinyemi said the meeting was private.
However, the meeting might not be unconnected with Atiku’s move to challenge the APC victory in the Feb 23 poll.
Oyo’s governor-elect Seyi Makinde also came visiting the former president for another closed-door meeting after Atiku left.
Makinde arrived Obasanjo’s residence around 4pm and went straight to the inner room of the former President.
The two later emerged from the closed-door meeting and held another meeting with some chieftains of the PDP, including the former deputy chairman (South) of the party, Chief Olabode George.
According to a statement by Obasanjo’s media aide, his boss advised the governor-elect to run an inclusive  government.
