Kano state governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has described the state’s Commissioner of Police Muhammed Wakili for being politically partial.
Governor Ganduje said this in an interview with BBC Hausa Service.
“I didn’t know him before now but the way he does his job is questionable. He has taken and favoured a particular political side, which is uncalled for and translates to mishandling his job”
Ganduje added that the Commissioner has no constitutional right to arrest either the governor or his deputy as he did “which is an indication of lack of professionalism from the side of the Commissioner”
On March 11, the Nigeria Police in Kano arrested the Deputy Governor, Nasiru Gawuna and the State Commissioner for Local Government, Alhaji Sule Garo over alleged threat to public peace.
The deputy governor enjoys immunity from arrest, according to the Nigerian constitution.
The Police later clarified that the deputy governor was saved from being manhandled by supporters of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party candidate, at the collation Centre
