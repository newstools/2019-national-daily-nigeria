Chief Salis Owolabi, governorship candidate of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Lagos State in the March 9 election, on Monday, rejected the result of the poll declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

Salis, at a news conference, said the election was marred with ‘multiple voting, intimidation, collation fraud’ , among others.

Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was declared winner of the election by the Returning Officer of INEC in the state, Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede.

He polled a total of 739,445 votes, while his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Jimi Agbaje, got 206,141 votes.

Salis polled a total of 3,370 votes in the election.

“I am not accepting the result of the governorship election. It is complete fraud.

“This is not an election and I totally reject it. A lot of miscounting was done against AD; they even tried to relegate us by putting us in the sixth position.

“I do not believe Sanwo-Olu won a clear contest,” Salis said.

He vowed to challenge the outcome at the election tribunal, expressing optimism of getting justice.

“I am going to court. I have overwhelming evidence and will get lawyers that handle election matters to look into these irregularities committed against my party in the just-concluded election.

“It is very easy to win the case when you have enough evidence,” Salis said.

He, however, said in spite of all that had happened, he would still remain relevant politically and not relent in empowering the masses.
