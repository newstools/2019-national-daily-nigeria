The Lassa fever outbreak in some parts of Nigeria has been taking its toll on the life of Nigerians. Over 15 persons have died from the epidemic while several others have been receiving medical attention since cases of Lassa fever were recorded in different parts of Ondo State between January and February 2019.
The Chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, in Ondo State, Dr. Wale Oke, disclosed this in Akure, the state capital, noting that majority of the death occurred in January.
Mostly affected by this scourge are towns and communities in the border areas of the state such as Owo, Ose, Akoko North, Akure South and Akure North local government areas. He, however, noted that no death was recorded in February, indicating that the epidemic is responding to medical interventions.
Ondo is one of the 23 States affected by Lassa fever.
