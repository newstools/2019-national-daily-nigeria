Emmanuel Jime, the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Benue, says his party is unperturbed by the declaration of polls in the state as inconclusive and appealed to his supporters to stay calm.


In a statement by Prof Eugene Aliegba, the Secretary of the APC Governorship Campaign Council on Monday in Makurdi, Jime commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for its decision, which he said, was backed by law.

”As a law-abiding party, we recognise the decision by INEC as legally binding. We remain upbeat and urge our supporters to stay calm and optimistic ahead of a rerun date.


”We will do the work required to clinch victory and earn the mandate of Benue people,” he assured.

He said the supplementary polls were ordered in parts of Benue owing to irregularities that occurred in such places.

“The APC submits to the decision by INEC and will present itself for the rerun elections when the electoral umpire fixes a date.


“The party extends its gratitude to the electorate, party faithful and supporters who trooped out in their numbers to queue behind its governorship candidate, Emmanuel Jime and all other candidates of the APC.”

It, however, called on security agencies to ensure that the electoral breaches that characterised the previous elections were prevented to guarantee its credibility.

“The party expresses its deep worries over the large scale cases of thuggery, intimidation, inducement, vote buying and results tinkering that the PDP deployed in its desperate bid to hold onto power.



“It calls on INEC and security agencies to ensure that the PDP adheres to the democratic tenants in the rerun.

“The party’s governorship candidate Emmanuel Jime welcomes the supplementary election and remains confident of victory when the exercise is conducted.”
