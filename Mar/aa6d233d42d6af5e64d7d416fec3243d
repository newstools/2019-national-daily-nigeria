Barely a week to the March 9 Governorship and House of Assembly elections, scheduled to hold in 29 states across Nigeria, the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Lagos State has reaffirmed its resolve to run a government focused on the welfare of the masses, charging electorates to come out en masse and vote for all its candidates.
Mr Kolawole Ajayi, the AD Chairman in the state made this call, while staging a road show to sensitise residents that the party would provide impactful governance that would uplift the generality of the masses.
Ajayi added that the party especially with the caliber of its gubernatorial candidate, a knowledgeable and prominent attorney in the U.S. High Chief Owolabi Salis, had been re-positioned to take over governance of the state.
He said that if Salis and other candidates churched out by the party for the various elective positions are  voted into power, residents were assured of infrastructure development, progress, shelter, food security and generally better standard of living.
“We are here to tell Lagosians that AD is still alive and kicking and that we are going into the next election to win and not to play.
“So, this is the time for everyone to speak up by voting for AD, whose driving force is the welfare for all; no candidate is in the race to make wealth for himself, this is about taking the commonwealth to the people.
“We expect to bring new development of dividends of democracy; as clearly stated in our party manifesto, we are purely a welfarist party. We encourage people to come out and vote massively for AD and stand to defend their vote,’’ Ajayi said.
The road show was taken to Agege and Ikeja areas of the state.
