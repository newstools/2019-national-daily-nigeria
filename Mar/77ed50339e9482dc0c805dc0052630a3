The legal team of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Tuesday visited the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Abuja, to inspect materials used in the conduct of the 2019 presidential election.
Counsel to the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, Emeka Etiaba, and his team met with INECâ€™S Director of Legal Services armed with the order granted by the Election Petition Tribunal which last week, directed INEC to allow PDP access to the materials.
The PDP is challenging the result of the elections in which President Muhammadu Buhari declared winner by the INEC. The result declared by the INEC has continued to be unsatisfactory to majority Nigerians, including PDP leaders.
The PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, went with the legal team to the INEC Headquarters to effect the court order.
