Kano State Police Command has dismissed rumours on the purported transfer of the state Commissioner of Police Muhammad Wakili.
“The CP is still in Kano,” the command’s spokesman, DSP Abdullahi Haruna, said in a statement issued in Kano on Wednesday.
He urged members of the public to ignore the rumour, describing it as the handiwork of mischief makers.
Haruna stressed that the command would not be distracted by such rumours, adding that already, police personnel have arrested three persons suspected of buying permanent voter cards (PVCs) from illegible voters in areas earmarked for the rerun governorship election.
He called on the people of the state to legally understand that buying and selling of Permanent Voter Cards is an offence Punishable under the Electoral Act.
“Any person found to be engaging in the act should be promptly reported to the nearest Police station for arrest, investigation and prosecution accordingly,” he said
