PDP’s presidential candidate who lost out in the Feb 23 election has given the APC government preconditions—to make him reverse his decision to challenge President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory.
Atiku Abubakar presented a six-point demand to the federal government when members of the National peace Committee, including Gen. Abubakar Abdusalam (retd) and Father Matthew Hassan Kikah, visited him Thursday.
First, Atiku and his team demanded the federal government unfreeze opposition politicians’ bank accounts.
H also asked for demilitarisation of subsequent polls.
Other demands include:
*That accreditation of voters should take place before voting in subsequent elections.
*That there should be no deployment of the military in subsequent elections.
* That INEC should open its back end server to all participating parties.
*That there should be a release of all politicians detained illegally by FG.
Atiku has decided to go court over what he called the debasement of Nigeria’s democracy witnessed in the 2019 presidential election.
The NPC however sought his understanding and urged him to do nothing that will jeopardise Nigeria’s peace.
The committee said they will be meeting with federal government to present those demands.
In 2015, the PDP made a similar demand after it lost to the APC candidate Buhari who was heady about dealing with the corrupt element of the last PDP government led by ex-President Goodluck Jonathan.
