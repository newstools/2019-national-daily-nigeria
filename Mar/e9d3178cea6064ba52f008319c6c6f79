The Apapa Command of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) generated N61 billion revenue between January and February.
Its outgoing Comptroller, Bashir Abubakar, made this known in Lagos on Monday during the handover ceremony to the new Comptroller of the command, Mohammed Abba-Kura.
Abubakar said that the feat was achieved by the drive of the officers at enforcing compliance in the operations.
“The command between January 1st to March 14th seized 24 containers of tomato paste and vegetable oil with duty paid value of N200, 867, 000.
“The export seat in the command made 2, 505, 076 US dollars and N765. 3 million on Free Onboard (FOB),” he said.
Abubakar, who described the incoming Comptroller as a goal better, said that with Abba-Kura, the good target of the command would be maintained.
He urged officers of the command to extend goodwill and cooperation to the new comptroller, while thanking them for a warm relationship during his stay in the command.
