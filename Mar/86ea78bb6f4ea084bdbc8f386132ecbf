Former Tottenham Hotspur player, Jermaine Jenas, has said Arsenal will finish outside the top-four on the Premier League table this season.


Arsenal are currently occupying the fourth position on the Premier League table but Jenas believes Unai Emery’s men will lose games between now and the end of the season.

“I don’t know how Arsenal are where they are, and that’s not meant as an insult,” Jenas told Starsport.


“At the start of the season, I don’t think I even had them in my top six. “I thought with the complete turnaround of management, the players they brought in – I’m not sure about some of them – and even the style of play, which has not been convincing, they have done unbelievably well.

“I’ve had arguments on Five Live about them, but you have to give them credit. That 22-match unbeaten run they went on might have been a fad, but they are currently in the top four.

“Do I see them finishing there? No – I think they will lose games between now and the end of the season and, if I was a Spurs player, Chelsea would be the worry now.

“As squads go, they should be challenging for the title with the players at their disposal. They are a team who could go on a run and not drop many points.”
