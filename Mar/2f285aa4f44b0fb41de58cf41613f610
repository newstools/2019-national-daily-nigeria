Members of the terrorist group Boko Haram in North East Nigeria on Monday night launched an attack on Michika, a town in Adamawa state.
Boko Haram had in September 2014 ahead of the 2015 general election taken over Michika, the headquarters of Michika Local Government Area (LGA). The LGA was however recaptured by the Nigerian military on 29 January 2015.
The insurgents who reportedly stormed the town and shot indiscriminately left residents of the town in confusion, leaving them with no better option than to run into the bush for shelter.
Michika is not far from the hideout of Boko Haram, the Sambisa Forest. The town also has four polling units where supplementary governorship poll is to hold on March 23, 2019.
The polling units are in Bazza Margi, Jigalambu, Moda/ Diaka/ Ghenjuwa and Sina/Kamale/ Kwande.
