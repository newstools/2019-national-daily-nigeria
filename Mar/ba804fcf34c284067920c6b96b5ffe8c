Tragedy struck when a man committed suicide in the ancient city of Ibadan, Oyo State, jumping off a network mast of a commercial bank in Sango on Saturday. It was gathered that the man was suspected to be mentally unstable. Many puzzle how the man got to the top of the mask from where he jumped to his death without being notices by peoples in the surrounding, though not a working day.
The Public Relations Officer of the Oyo State Police Command, Olugbenga Fadeyi, was said to have confirmed the incident, noting that the naked victim entered the bank’s premises through the small gate and climbed the mast before the security personnel became aware.
The PPRO affirmed that the victim jumped down the roof of the bank before the Police and Fire Service personnel arrived the scene.
The corpse was said to have been deposited at a Hospital for autopsy while efforts are being made to find out the victim’s identity and locate the relations.
