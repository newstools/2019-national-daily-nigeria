A former director in charge of political office at the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), Awal Yakassi, has given his testimony in the alleged non-declaration of asset case against the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen.
Yakassi testified on behalf of the Federal Government as the second prosecution witness on Thursday during the resumed trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT).
He told the Tribunal that he was the one who attended to Justice Onnoghen when he submitted two of his asset declaration forms in December 2016.
The witness said he received the forms and signed on them and provided the judgeâ€™s representative with two acknowledgement slips for receiving the forms.
Under cross-examinations, he noted that he was not served any subpoena to appear before the Tribunal.
When asked if he was at the Tribunal giving evidence as an officer of the CCB, Yakassi said he was giving evidence as a person who worked in that office in the past since he has retired.
Justice Onnoghen is facing a six-count charge of non-declaration of assets and operating of domiciliary account which were said to be contrary to the code of conduct of public servants in Nigeria. The CJN was earlier suspended by fiat by President Muhammadu Buhari and replaced with Justice Tanko Mumammad as acting CJN.
The matter is being handled by the National Judicial Council (NJC).
