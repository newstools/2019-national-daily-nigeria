They were received by chieftains of APC,  Alhaji Kunle Suleiman and Mr Olawoyin Magaji.

Last Tuesday, over 500 PDP members from Osin Wara, Osin Egbejila ward and others declared allegiance to the APC in Surulere.
Aluko said the outcome of the National Assembly elections was the clearest manifestation that Kwarans had decided to reject and retire Sen.Bukola Saraki for reasons of bad governance, oppression and non-inclusive leadership.
“Our people are tired. Salaries don’t get paid in the true sense of the word and the infrastructure on the ground is not commensurate with the resources the state has received over the years.
“Worst still, people are tired of leaders who see everything from their own comfort zone.
“People are tired of the status quo. They are angry and fed up with dictatorial leadership and the result is what you just said,” Aluko said.
