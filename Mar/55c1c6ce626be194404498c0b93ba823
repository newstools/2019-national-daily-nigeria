Arsenal will reportedly send Denis Suarez back to Barcelona after the midfielder’s dreadful loan spell at the Emirates.
The Gunners brought Suarez, the Spain international, in on a temporary basis earlier this year, and they have the option of signing him outright at the end of the season.
However, he has made just six appearances for Unai Emery’s side, and has still not started a match.
Emery, who worked with Suarez at Sevilla, is understood to fear the midfielder cannot cope with the ‘physical demands of English football’, The Sun report.
And rather than hoping the 25-year-old adapts to the Premier League, Arsenal will reportedly end Suarez’s loan and send him back to Barcelona.
Given signing Suarez permanently this summer now appears off the table, Arsenal have also already started assessing alternative targets ahead of the transfer window reopening.
Christopher Nkunku was a target of the Gunners’ throughout January and Emery is believed to be stepping up his interest in the 21-year-old Paris Saint-Germain midfielder.
Arsenal currently sit fourth in the Premier League, two points clear of Manchester United in fifth and only one point behind third place Tottenham.
They have a relatively easy run-in over the final stretch of the season as Emery aims to guide Arsenal to a top four finish, though the Gunners were handed perhaps the toughest draw in the Europa League quarter-finals last week, with Napoli awaiting the north Londoners in the last eight.
