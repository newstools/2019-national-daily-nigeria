Final list of candidates published by the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) for this Saturday’s, governorship election has shown that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has no governorship candidate in Enugu State.

The development is coming barely four days to the governorship and states house of assembly elections across the country.

According to INEC, the reason there is no governorship and deputy governorship candidate of the APC in Enugu State was due to court order which asked it not to recognise Senator Ayogu Eze as the party’s governorship candidate for the state.

Recall that a Federal High Court in Abuja, in a judgment delivered by Justice I. Ekwo had sacked Senator Eze as APC governorship candidate and asked INEC to instead recognize George Ogara as the candidate of the party in the state.

It was however learnt that the Adams Oshiomhole led National Working Committee (NWC) has continued to ignore the order of the court by submitting Ogara’s name to INEC.

Consequently, INEC published its latest list of governorship candidates for the states of the federation without any APC candidate for Enugu State.

The latest list on 330 pages was signed by INEC secretary, Rose Oriaran-Anthony, with Enugu occupying pages 100 to 111.

APC with the latest development will be going to the Saturday election with no governorship candidates in Rivers, Cross Rivers and Enugu states.
