The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has fixed Thursday, March 28, 2019, for the supplementary governorship election in Adamawa State.
INEC rescheduled the election for Thursday after the Adamawa State High Court sitting in Yola reversed the restraining order on INEC not to conduct the election.
Before the March 9 election was declared inconclusive, Ahmed Umar Fintiri, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was leading with 367,471 votes, while the incumbent Governor, Jibrilla Bindow of the All Progressives Congress, APC, trailed him with 334,995 votes.
In vacating the order, Justice Abdulaziz Waziri had said: “Election is a constitutional matter; this court would not be used to breach the process.”
Thus, Fintiri was leading with a margin 32,476 votes, while the canceled votes were 40,988. INEC will be conducting supplementary in 44 polling units in 28 registration areas.
