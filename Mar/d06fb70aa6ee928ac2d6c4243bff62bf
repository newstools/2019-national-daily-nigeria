The Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) in Benue State has tasked The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, political parties, the electorate as well as the general public to abide by the rules of the game in respect of the scheduled supplementary election in the state.
The IPAC Chairman, Godwin Odeh, in Makurdi, said everything must be done to avoid a breakdown of law and order.
The leadership of the inter-party advisory council Benue state chapter urged the people of the state to come out in their numbers to conclude the process which started on the ninth of March without fear of molestation noting that it will not accept any form of undue interference in the process.
The pressure group expressed concern over threats reportedly emanating from some leaders of political parties to subvert the will of the people and declare their candidate winner regardless of his position.
Similarly, Frank Utoo a legal expert and politician refuted rumours making the rounds of a planned militarization of the rerun adding that the military should rather be deployed to troubled parts of the state still under attack by armed herders.
The various speakers who see the rerun as a mere formality urged INEC to be truly independent.
