The Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) is pleased to announce a comprehensive online platform to connect Nigerian raw material suppliers and buyers.
RMRDC has rewarded this project to RP Marketing Solution Ltd (RedPepe), an end to end digital marketing service agency based out of Nigeria.
RedPepe has commenced the project to build a comprehensive and interactive portal. A new marketing strategy is to now be in place for promoting the vision and mission of RMRDC in domestic and international market. The new Portal is expected to be launched by RMRDC in March 2019.

RMRDC’s vision is to be an indispensable catalyst for industrial growth and development in Nigeria.
Through the new online platform, the local Manufacturers & Producers would be connected digitally to domestic and international buyers.
