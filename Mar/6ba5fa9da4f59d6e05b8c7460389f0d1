Well a quick review of how I nailed it yesterday. I said for
Fulham Vs ManCity we should expect “Manchester City winning Fulham and also for an outcome of two goals +”.

For Juventus Vs Empoli I said,  “I believe Juve will win today. It is a sure win for them”.   And for Barcelona Vs Espanyol I said “Barcelona will in this match with nothing less than two goals”.

It all happened just as predicted. So now today is juicy as well:

Real Betis will win in
Rayo Vallecano – Real Betis

Monaco will win or draw in
