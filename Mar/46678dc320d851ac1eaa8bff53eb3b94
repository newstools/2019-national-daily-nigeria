Shehu Sani, the senator representing Kaduna Central, on Thursday said the President Muhammadu Buhari was not interested in any serious electoral reforms.
The lawmaker explained that both previous governments and that of Buhari were not interested in serious electoral reforms because they tend to benefit from its failures.
He, however, stated that only former President Goodluck Jonathan could appoint a chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, without meeting and knowing him.
In a tweet, he also stated that only Jonathan could approve the use of technology, which terminated his administration.
“The Previous Governments including the one in power doesn’t want any serious electoral reforms because they tend to benefit from its failings.
“Its only GEJ that can appoint an INEC chair he never met and never knew and approved of technology for use that can terminate his reign,” he tweeted.
