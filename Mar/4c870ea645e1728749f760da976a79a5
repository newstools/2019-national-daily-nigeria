Manchester United were beaten 2-0 by Arsenal at the Emirates stadium on Sunday evening to inflict interim Red Devils manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær with his first league defeat.
Alex Iwobi earned his 27th league appearance this season for Arsenal off the bench when he replaced German star, Mesut Ozil with 77 minutes on the clock.
The Nigerian has featured in the last four games the Gunners have contested in all competitions against their opponents.
Iwobi nearly made an instant impact after his introduction, darting into space before freeing Alexandre Lacazette through the middle but saw his cutback cleared away by Fred on the slide.
Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka meanwhile, has not been selected for a topflight game since last featuring against Fulham in January.
Granit Xhaka put the hosts ahead with a superb effort in the first period before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sealed the victory from the spot, their first over their rivals since 2017.
Arsenal moved into fourth position on 60 points, two more than their opponents in fifth as the race for the Champions League spots hots up.
