Former Manchester United captain, Bryan Robson, has said that the likes of Chris Smalling and Ander Herrera deserve to be named the club’s new captain ahead of fellow teammate, Paul Pogba.
ND had reported on Friday that Pogba is in line to be named Manchester United’s new captain after this season.
The France midfielder wore the armband at the beginning of this term, but soon fell out with Jose Mourinho, who went on to strip him off the vice-captaincy role in September.
But Robson believes both Herrera and Smalling are more suitable candidates than Pogba for the position.
“In the current squad, because of the way they try to organise, they communicate with team-mates, I think we only have two who are quite good at that,” Robson told Sport Witness.
“So we have Chris Smalling, who tries to organise, he shouts at people, he organises people. And then Ander Herrera.
“I’ve watched him in training, he’s an organiser. And that’s what you need from your captain.
“But Paul Pogba plays more of an individual sort of side. “He’s not really saying to people “you come here, you come here, push forward”, or just applaud your teammate. When they give the ball away, you encourage them. You don’t always tell everybody off.

“Sometimes you have to encourage your teammates, you can’t just be telling people off all the time… I think Herrera and Smalling are two captains.”
