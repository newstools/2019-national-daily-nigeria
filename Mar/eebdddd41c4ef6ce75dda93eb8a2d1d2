…considering a sabbatical year leave
The future of Massimiliano Allegri is unclear at the moment. “I will decide, we will decide”. These were the words of the Juventus coach, explaining that there will be a confrontation with the management to decide.
 The former Milan coach seems to be closer to an exit from the Allianz Stadium than ever, thanks to a European campaign that could end in a week. The match against Atletico Madrid will be decisive: if he wins, Juve will likely go along with him, also depending on the next matches. If he loses, this season will be virtually finished 3 months in advance.
 And what then? The benches of Big European clubs, in the summer, could be free: Manchester United, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Bayern Munich could, in fact, be looking around for better options. But according to La Repubblica, the Tuscan coach is evaluating a sabbatical year after a stressful, tiring and annoying season, which is not over yet and which will be determined based on the match against Diego Simeone’s Atletico.
