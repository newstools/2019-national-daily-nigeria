A Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped the re-run election in six wards in Lagos state.
The wards are Awodi-Ora, Wilmer Olodi, Tolu, Ojo road, Mosafejo and Temidire, which recorded some disturbances during the national assembly elections on February 23rd, 2019.
The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had scheduled the election to hold along with Saturday’s governorship and state assembly election.
The order was made exparte, by Justice Bello Kawu who adjourned the hearing of the substantive motion to the 21st of March, 2019.
However, it could not be confirmed if the court order was complied with in this Saturday’s elections in Lagos.
