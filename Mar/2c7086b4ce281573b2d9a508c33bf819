There is rising tension in Kaduna State over suspicious plot to impeach the Deputy Governor of the state, Barnabas Bala Bantex an issue that has been lingering since the conclusion of the 2019 general elections in the state. Residents of the state have been engulfed in palpable apprehension over insinuations that the Kaduna State House of Assmbly is planning to serve Deputy Governor Barnabas Bala Bantex impeachment notice. However, the basis of the impeachment could not be ascertained but the deputy governor-elect, Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, is being observed to be playing some nominal roles in the activities of the state government even before the May 29 inauguration.
Governor Barnabas Bala Bantex had undermined Governor Nasir El-Rufai to contest the Kaduna South Senatorial District on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general elections, perhaps, knowing fully well that he was not nominated by the governor to contest re-election for second tenure.
Unfortunately, Senator Danjuma La’ah, representing Kaduna South Senatorial District in the National Assembly was re-elected in the February 23 National Assembly election.

Rijo Shekari, candidate of the SDP had 9,609 votes, Benedict Kura of ADC 741 votes.
