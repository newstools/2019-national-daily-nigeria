Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has blamed manager Niko Kovac’s defensive set-up for their Champions League exit at the hands of Liverpool, National Daily learnt.
The Bundesliga champions secured a 0-0 draw in the first leg of their last-16 tie at Anfield, but their lack of an away goal left them vulnerable heading into Wednesday’s second leg.
Lewandowski was fuming after the match, and pointed to his side’s lack of attacking intent in the first leg as a principal reason they are now out of Europe.
The Polish star also didn’t feel that his side showed enough interest in attacking during the second leg at home.
” I think we didn’t try to play offensive and try to score the goal because we didn’t have a lot of chances also and that was our problem today,” the striker continued.
