The father of former England footballer Adam Johnson said it was good to have his son home after his release from prison.
The former Middlesbrough, Manchester City and Sunderland star was jailed for six years in 2016 for engaging in sexual activity with a 15-year-old fan.
Johnson’s father Dave spoke to reporters outside his 31-year-old son’s house in Castle Eden, County Durham.
The Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on prisoner releases.
Johnson, who played for England 12 times, was released part way through his jail term.
Christopher Stacey, the co-director of Unlock, a charity for people with convictions, said Johnson should be allowed to resume his playing career.
