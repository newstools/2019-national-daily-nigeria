The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership, CACOL, has lauded efforts of the anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, in unearthing the alleged criminal laundering of about One Hundred and Fifty Million Euros with Atiku Abubakar’s lawyer, UyiekpenOsagie- Giwa and the ex-Vice-President’s son-in-law, Abdullahi Babalele as prime suspects.
The Centre also cautioned the EFCC to be very meticulous in handling the sensitive corruption matter, so as not to leave anyone in doubt, because of its inherent political innuendos.
In a press release made available to pressmen on Thursday by CACOL’s Executive Chairman, Debo Adeniran, he noted that, “The case of laundering of One Hundred and Fifty Million Euros at election period by very close associates of the former Vice President and Presidential candidate of the opposition party, People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is one that is bound to generate a measure of public comments and interests, due primarily to the kind of society we have inadvertently turned Nigeria into overtime.
“However, crime has no other name, especially when it bothers on financial impropriety which we all agree, is single handedly responsible for the downward socioeconomic situation of things we are facing today, as a country.
“This is why we need to commend, seriously, the sense of responsibility and due diligence, with which the EFCC, has monitored, investigated and prosecuted this high-brow corruption issue, until this moment.

“As CACOL, we believe that, it is the moral duty of all Nigerians to be well informed and acquainted with how the country is being administered and what efforts are made, especially by the politically exposed people (PEP) in manipulating it, either to our own collective good or peril.
“This is why we have laid the facts as known to us bare for critical appreciation; as we insist that issue of corruption is too weighty to be swept under the carpet, irrespective of whose ox is gored.
“In same vein, we reiterate our earlier position that, relevant anti-graft agencies should endeavour to investigate the content of and purpose of the two bullion vans, purportedly sighted within the Bourdillon premises of the leader of All People’s Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on the eve of the last Presidential elections with a view to informing Nigerians of their findings and what further actions, if any crime were actually committed.”
