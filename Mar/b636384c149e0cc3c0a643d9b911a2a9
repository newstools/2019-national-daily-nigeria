A food vendor was electrocuted in Umuahia,  Abia, as she tried to rescue a colleague that stepped on a high-tension cable.
The incident happened at the Michael Okpara Square, along Club Road.
An eyewitness said the woman, among others, didn’t know their colleague was shocked by the cable when they heard her cry for help.
Although the colleague survived, the woman that responded first and faster didn’t.
She died inside a tricycle used to rush her to hospital.
The owner of the food stand was said to have gone to report the incident to the police when Southern City News visited the scene.
When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the incident.
Ogbonna said the command would investigate the cause of death.
