The governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has denied working against his own interests and that of the APC which he represented in the Saturday, March 9 governorship and house of assembly elections in Imo State.
Senator Uzodinma described the allegations that he worked for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and winner of the election, Emeka Ihedioha, as unfounded and malicious.
Uzodinma who was fourth in the election result, protested that the accusation by Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State was a mere plot to tarnish his image, after the governor had worked against the APC in sponsoring a candidate, Uche Nwosu, on the platform of the Action Alliance (AA) after failing to acquire the APC ticket by undemocratic means.
Governor Okorocha, had alleged that the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and Uzodimma, representing Imo West senatorial district in the National Assembly, were responsible for the party’s inability to win the March 9th governorship election in Imo State.
 The Imo Governor scolded Senator Uzodinma who he said allegedly was celebrating with the PDP candidate and winner of the governorship election, Chief Emeka Ihedioha, after he was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Owerri, Imo State.
