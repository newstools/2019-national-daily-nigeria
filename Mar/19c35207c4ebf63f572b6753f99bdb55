Senator Dion Melaye, representing Kogi West senatorial district in the National Assembly, chided President Muhammadu Buhari, candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, over what he considered the President’s failure to handle elections issues in the country with utmost decorum and respect for the rule of law.
The Kogi representative Senators had demanded President Buhari to apologize to Nigerians and retract his statement ordering the military to deal ruthlessly with ballot box snatchers, which he noted eventually became the acts of leaders of the ruling party without modicum of security interventions in the presidential and national assembly elections across the country.
Senator Melaye subsequently declared that President Buhari speaks with ‘the anointing of Idi-Amin’ under a democracy.
 “I am utterly disappointed in my president. I am completely in shock that in a democratic setting, a president will speak with the anointing if Idi Amin of Uganda, the president will use the word ‘ruthless’, the president will order killings of Nigerians without going through legal procedures. That is totally unacceptable.
“I expected that by now the President should have apologized to Nigerians and withdraw that statement but instead there has been a lot of efforts, boxing the wind by Chieftains of the APC, trying to defend what is not defendable,” Melaye had declared.
Several other stakeholders also noted that the President’s campaign Director General, Rotimi Amaechi, has continued to hold Rivers State hostage and obstructing electoral processes with the same Army that President Buhari ordered to deal ruthlessly with those who obstruct the electro4rela process, yet, there have been no interventions or any word from the President while Rivers State has been turned into war zone by his campaign Director.
