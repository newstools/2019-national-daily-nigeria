The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has said who becomes the next speaker of the House of Representatives is not his business.

Dogara stated this in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Turaki Hassan on Sunday, in reaction to permutations in the media over who becomes what in the next session of the Green Chamber.

The Speaker, who recently won a reelection to the House, said the tenure of the current House still extends to the next three months, adding that there were many pending issues before it.

According to him, the pending issues before the House needed urgent legislative attention, including the 2019 Appropriations Bill.

“The Speaker is concentrating on accomplishing all he promised in the Legislative Agenda of the House of Representatives.

“Who becomes what in the 9th House of Representatives is not the concern or business of the current Speaker, Rt Hon Yakubu Dogara.

“You should please spare him from these unfounded speculations,” Turaki said.
