The former FC Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta recently received two visits to the city of Kobe (Japan) where he has lived since he went to play football in Japan. They were those of TV3 and Bein Sports, and the manchego declared that “it is always missing the day to day, everything that surrounds, the stadium, playing but now from the outside I am a fan more and I am looking forward to it going very well” .
Iniesta sees very feasible that the azulgrana team win all this year: “I have always been very optimistic, for me it is the best club and the best players, and they are in all three competitions in a very good position, it will depend on the last stage but they are trained and without a doubt the objective is possible “. The Fuentealbilla wanted to show that “this team and this club have made the leagues seem to have less merit than it has but it is really brutal.”
The one who wore the ‘8’ in the Barça, number that still carries in the Vissel, confessed that “I will remain pending there for a long time about the elimination in Rome, beyond the moment and for the time being it was very hard and you are left with that feeling that is not the best to bid farewell to the Champions League, but conclusions are drawn from everything “.
Iniesta is clear that Barça has not lost its style: “The important thing is what the club has wanted to do for a long time and must continue to maintain regardless of the players that are.”
Of the duel before the Manchester commented that “it will be a hard eliminatory one because the Manchester is a great equipment and has great players and has eliminated to the PSG, but the staff knows it and are to a step of getting into the semifinal”.
