Troops of the Nigerian army repelled an attempt by suspected Boko Haram insurgents to capture Kopa Village in Madagali local government area of Adamawa State on Monday night.
Locals residing in Kopa informed AIT that their village was taken over by the insurgents who stormed in large numbers.
The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Othman Abubakar confirmed the attack by saying the police received information that terrorists attempted to invade Kopa, a borderline village between Adamawa and Borno in Madagali local government area.
He, however, said they were aware that the miscreants were repelled by troops of the Nigerian armed forces.
Boko Haram terrorists have attempted to infiltrate the area in recent times. The latest was when the Union Bank in Michika was bombed and looted by the terrorists a fourth night ago.
