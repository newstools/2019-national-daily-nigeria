The Inspector General of Police, Ag. IGP M.A Adamu NPM, mni has ordered a comprehensive and speedy investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the late Ogar Jumbo, an Assistant Superintendent of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).




     

Recall that Ogar Jumbo Ochigbo, an Assistant Superintendent of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC) was murdered in the presence of his wife and children allegedly by some police officers near Nyanya market, Abuja on Wednesday this week.

While condoling with the family, the Commandant General of the NSCDC, friends and professional colleagues of the deceased, the IGP reassures them that everything humanly possible will be done to ensure that justice prevails in the case.

He equally enjoins that the NSCDC along with the family of the deceased, may, for the purpose of transparency, nominate any medical doctor of their choice to witness the autopsy, at the appropriate time and venue.

“Needless to state that an autopsy, which is a comprehensive forensic examination on the body of a dead person, will help the investigators to have a definitive understanding of the real cause of death of the deceased.”

The IGP therefore calls for calm from the family and friends of the deceased and the entire public, reiterating that the case will not be swept under the carpet.
