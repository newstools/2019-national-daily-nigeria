Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri has identified areas forward, Gonzalo Higuain needs to improve. According to Sarri, Higuain needs to work on his ‘physical condition’, especially his acceleration. Sarri stated this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Fulham on Sunday. Higuain has so far scored two goals since joining the Stamford Bridge from Juventus in January.
“I think Higuain’s contribution was really very good in our last match against Tottenham,” Sarri was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “He played with his team-mates well, I think that he needs more acceleration because now he is a little more resistant but without the acceleration he had in Napoli for example.
“I think he needs to improve his physical condition especially for acceleration and then he will score, of course.”
