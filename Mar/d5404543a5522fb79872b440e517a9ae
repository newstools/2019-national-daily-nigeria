Meanwhile, due to widespread disruption of elections in Rivers State, INEC has suspended all electoral processes in the oil-rich state until further notice.

Similarly, governorship elections in Adamawa, Bauchi, Plateau, and Sokoto states will not be concluded until after supplementary elections are conducted.

INEC has declared the results in all the four states inconclusive because the lead margins were lower than the total number of votes cancelled in certain areas.

According to the law, supplementary elections will take place only in the polling units where elections were cancelled. The elections will take place within 21 days of the initial polls.
