There are reports of ballot box snatching in the Ogbomoso area of Oyo State by heavily armed thugs suspected to be sponsored by some politicians.

The thugs who reportedly came in their numbers snatched already thumb-printed ballot papers when they invaded Ogbomoso polling unit at Oke Ola Farm Settlement, Unit Four of Ogbomoso South Local Government Area of the state.

The development comes after the Zenith Labour Party leader and former governor of Oyo State, Senator Adewolu Ladoja, earlier lamented the incidence of ballot snatching in the state.

Speaking after casting his vote at Ward 10, Unit 013 on Ondo Street, Bodija Estate, Ibadan, Ladoja said ballot snatchers are having a field day in some polling units across the state.

Ladoja who blamed the development as a result of lack of concerned security operatives said he had received reports of ballot-snatching at some polling booths on Iwo Road, Aperin, and Oja Igbo.
