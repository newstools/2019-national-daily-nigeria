Says country has no business with poverty



 

The Venezuelan Ambassador to Nigeria, David Velasquez, at a three-day international agricultural technology exhibition held in collaboration with the Osun State Government, mocked the Nigerian Government over rising poverty in the country. The envoy decried that Nigeria has no reason to be poor given the vast endowments in agriculture.
The three days international exhibition and conference was organized to boost efforts towards the diversification of the Nigerian economy.
Velasquez acknowledged that Nigeria is fortunate to be blessed with favourable climate, fertile land, experienced manpower and high yielding seedlings that can easily curtail youth unemployment and boost the economy of the country. He remarked that his country is participating in the exhibition because there is the need for cross fertilization of ideas and products.
Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, whose tenure is shaken by the ruling of the Osun State governorship Election Petition that unseated him last before he proceeded on appeal, stated that he is committed tos making Osun State the hub of agriculture and food basket of the nation.
Other participants at the event demanded that the bulk of Nigeriaâ€™s budgetary allocation be devoted to the agriculture sector.
