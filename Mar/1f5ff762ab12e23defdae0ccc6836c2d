Julen Lopetegui claims to Real Madrid 28 million euros for his dismissal. According to ‘El Transistor’ of Onda Cero, the technician has the club of Concha Espina in the courts demanding the payment of the three years for which he signed, a total of 28 million euros.
The former coach of Madrid committed last June with the white club until 2021. However, the poor results led to his dismissal in October after 14 games in which he won six wins, two draws and six defeats.
The coach recalled his time at Madrid in an interview in ‘El Partidazo de COPE’: “I am grateful to Madrid, it was a sensational experience for the fans and I wish him well”.
