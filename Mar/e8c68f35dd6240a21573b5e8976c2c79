A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Dr Dakuku Peterside, says he is not behind the arrest of Rivers Commissioner for Education, Dr. Tamunosisi Gogo-Jaja.
He also denied accusation that he was planning to disrupt Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections.
Peterside, the Director-General of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), in a statement on Friday, said: “Rivers people know me as a peaceful person. I am proud of my heritage and Opobo/Nkoro LGA’s people love me, because of my antecedents.
“Associating me with evil deeds is not only reckless; it is the handiwork of jobless people and a jittery pay master who is afraid of his own past misdeeds.
“Despite belonging to different political leaning, Gogo-Jaja remains my brother and friend. I have no reason to hurt or harm him. I will never be part of such plot.
“I have never been associated with violence and would never support such. I am a man of peace and decent engagement. Only those who have skeletons in their cupboards are now looking for whom to pull down.”
Peterside urged with Rivers people to be peaceful ahead of Saturday’s polls and cooperate with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies to ensure smooth elections.
Governor Nyesom Wike’s education commissioner and his driver were arrested in Port Harcourt on Wednesday evening by troops of 6 Division, Nigerian Army, with incriminating items found on them.
Gogo-Jaja, a former Majority Leader of Rivers House of Assembly, was arrested with his driver in his residence at Government Reservation Area (GRA), Phase 3, Port Harcourt, paraded at 6 division on Thursday and handed over to Rivers Police Command.
Earlier, Rivers Commissioner for Urban Development and Physical Planning, Dr. Reason Onya, was arrested during the presidential and National Assembly elections of February 23.
