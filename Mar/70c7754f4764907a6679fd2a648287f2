The Federal Government has disclosed its readiness to revisit the creation of grazing reserves across the country.

The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, made this known on Thursday while receiving 64 participants of the Executive Intelligence Management Course 12 and faculty members of the Institute for Security Studies, lower Usma Dam, Bwari, Abuja, at the headquarters of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The minister informed his guests that the move would resolve the continued conflict between farmers and herdsmen while it would also create employment.

He, however, noted that no state would be compelled to give out land for grazing but the government was ready to support individuals and state government who would show commitment to the course.

Ogbeh said, “We are not going to any state that is not interested and we are not going to collect anybody’s land.”

According to a statement released by the Ministry, the Minister expressed happiness towards the kind gesture displayed by the delegates.

The delegates were led by the Director of the Institute, Alhaji A. S. Adeleke who was represented by the Deputy Director, Studies, Dr A. M. Wali.
