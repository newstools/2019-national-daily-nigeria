There was calm around the palace and several parts of Lagos metropolis affiliated to the royal throne when the High Court in Lagos State affirmed enthronement of His Royal Highness, Rilwan Akiolu, as the Oba of Lagos. The court had at mid-day on Friday indicated that judgment would be delivered on the suit challenging the installation of the royal father of the state highest traditional institution.
Justice Candide Johnson of the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja, delivering judgment on the suit which has been going on for a long time, affirmed the crowing Rilwan Akiolu, a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, as the Oba of Lagos. The judge, thus, dismissed the suit filed by the two plaintiffs challenging the right of the royal father to ascend to the throne.
Prince Adedoyin Adebiyi and Prince Rasheed Modile had approached the court, challenging the enthronement of Oba Rilwan Akiolu as the rightful traditional ruler.
The two plaintiffs, both from the Akinsemoyin Ruling House, contend that they were chosen by the family to contest for the throne, after the death of the late Oba of Lagos, Oba Adeyinka Oyekan II, arguing that the incumbent royal father has no rightful claim to the throne.
Oba Akiolu, however, argued that he was rightfully chosen by the kingmakers, which led to his coronation on May 23, 2003.
The legal battle had commenced after his coronation and crowning leading to his ascension to the throne.
