Court of Appeal has reversed the judgement of the Federal High Court, Jalingo, Taraba State, which disqualified the APC governorship candidate, Sani Danladi, in Taraba State from contesting the March 9, 2019 governorship election.
The Federal High Court had on Wednesday disqualified Sani Daladi for falsifying his age in documents submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.
However, the Taraba State Commissioner of Police and the INEC Resident Commissioner had insisted that Danladi remained the APC candidate except there was a documented directive contrary to that.
