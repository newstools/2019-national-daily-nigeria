Since the inception of the Sly Monay’s African symbolised agbada in 2018, the innovative fashion brand has gained a lot of recognition both in Nigerian market and across Africa. This no doubt is premised on the fact that for the first time, Africans found something that they can relate with.
Ever since the Symbolised Agbada came into existence, a lot of local tailors have attempted to copy the design in a bid to satisfy their customers.
According to Sly Monay, it is quite disturbing that one will create a design and someone else is out there copying it and making money out of such. The fashion industry in Africa should put in place measures to protect original designs.
The beautiful African symbols on the Symbolised Agbadas are called Adinkra.
“Adinkra are visual symbols, originally created by the Akan of Ghana and the Gyaman of Cote d’Ivoire in West Africa that represent concepts or original thoughts. Adinkra are used on fabric, walls, in pottery, woodcarvings and logos. Fabric adinkra are often made by woodcut sign writing as well as screen printing. They also can be used to communicate messages that represent parts of life”.
