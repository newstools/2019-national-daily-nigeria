The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, against attempts to tamper with already collated and declared results in 14 local government areas in the Bauchi State governorship election. The PDP issued the warning as the INEC gave an order for the resumption of and completion of the result of the governorship election in Bauchi State. 
PDP had cautioned that with the tensed atmosphere in Bauchi State and the level of awareness of the people, any attempt to alter already announced results would attract serious consequences.
The party had questioned the legality of the exparte order restraining the INEC from conducting the supplementary election in cancelled polling units in Adamawa State.
Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary, had alerted the National Peace Committee not to be silent at this critical time, especially, with the development in Rivers State, adding that any attempt by the INEC to play to the gallery of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State will be provocative.
