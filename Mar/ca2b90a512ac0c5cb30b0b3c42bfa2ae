He urged the electorate to eschew violence and work orderly so that they could  cast their votes at the polling units and ensure it counted.
“Let us shame those who predicted violence in Akwa Ibom and show them that we can get it right in a peaceful manner,” he said.
That  party officials were orderly and the voters conducted themselves in peaceful manner in some of the polling units visited.
