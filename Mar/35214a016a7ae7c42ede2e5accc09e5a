Pays visits to Morocco



 

Pope Francis has intensified his commitment to promoting inter-religious harmony between Christians, Muslims and others across the world. The Pope on Saturday departed Rome on a light trip to Morocco to promote inter-religious dialogue, encourage and support efforts by the North African country’s King Mohammed to spread a moderate form of Islam.
The Pope is expected to spend about 27 hours in Morocco; he is making his first visit the North African country, and writing history as the first to the country by a Pope since 1985.
Pope Francis and the King of Morocco are scheduled to visit an institute the monarch founded in 2015 for the training of Imams, including male and female preachers of Islam. The Vatican noted that it will be the first time a Pope visits such a school.
The Vatican considers the trip a spiritual continuation of Francis’ historic visit to the United Arab Emirates in February, when he became the first Pope to set foot on the Arabian Peninsula.
