Officials have informed plans are now underway for the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to apply to FIFA for USA-born Toni Payne to change her international allegiance in time for the World Cup in France, National Daily gathered.
Payne, whose parents are from Ibadan, has represented USA at U17 and Olympic team levels, has said she is open to play for the Super Falcons.
“Coach Thomas Dennerby has followed Toni and tried to get her to come down for the Cyprus Cup, but this eventually did not come to pass,” an official said.
“He is keen for the exciting forward to play for Nigeria at the World Cup in June, but that can only be possible if FIFA grant her application for a change of international allegiance before the tournament.”
