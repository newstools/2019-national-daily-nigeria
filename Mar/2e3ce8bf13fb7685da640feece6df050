New Governor accuses outgoing Governor of sabotage
Fresh crisis appears to be looming in Bauchi State, compelling the governor-elect, Bala Mohammed, to raise an alarm that the outgoing governor, Mohammed Abubakar, is allegedly planning to award spurious contracts worth N4 billion and recruit 8, 000 teachers with a view to leaving a huge financial burden for him when he takes over.
Ladan Salihu, speaking on behalf of the new governor, noted that Mohammed had decried that the actions were allegedly designed to sabotage and cripple the incoming administration at its inception.
Ladan Salihu said governor Abubakar sacked over 2, 000 traditional district heads when he took over in 2015 on the grounds that the state was facing a financial crisis and wondered why the governor would employ new staff towards the end of his tenure.
He alleged that state assets were currently being carted away by officials of the outgoing government.
