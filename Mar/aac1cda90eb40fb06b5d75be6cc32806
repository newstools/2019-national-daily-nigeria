Remo Stars Football Club (RSFC) winger, Dare Shokunbi has assured that he and his teammates will do everything within their purview to redeem their image and return to winning ways, National Daily gathered.
The Sky Blue Stars will welcome Rangers International to the Gateway International Stadium, Sagamu on Wednesday, 27th of March, 2019 in a rescheduled match day eleven (11) fixture of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL).
The Flying Antelopes defeated the Sagamu based side 5-2 on Sunday in match day twelve (12) at the Nnamdi Azikwe Stadium, Enugu State.
The host, Remo Stars have lost just once in their last two games while the visitors are yet to lose in their last three (3) games in the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League.
Tomorrow encounter would be the fourth (4) time both side will be meeting in the league with the visitors dominating with advantage ahead of the host and the last time they met in Sagamu, the visitors went with all three points.
In a chat with National Daily Shokunbi says it’s an uphill task, it’s going to be difficult but he feels he and his wards are determined to pick maximum points against them just the way they did in Enugu.
“We are quite disappointed with the kind of result we had on Sunday, we went with full determination to at least pick a point but it wasn’t our day.”
“We have a return leg against them tomorrow, it’s going to be an uphill task but we are determined to pick maximum points against them just the way they did in Enugu.”
“We have the chance to redeem our image tomorrow, they defeated us 5-2 and I think it’s the talk of the town now, the only thing is to overturn things and change the topic on the mouth of the fans out there and I pray we achieve by God’s grace” Shokunbi concludes.
