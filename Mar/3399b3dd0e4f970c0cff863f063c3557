Two lawyers representing the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa state were alleged to have attempted to invade the chambers of Justice Jane Inyang at the Federal High Court complex Yenagoa.

The two lawyers came to demand copies of the court order and ruling issued by the judge which stopped the supplementary elections in Brass Constituency 1.

The news medium said a court explained that he had told the lawyers to come back the following day to enable the judge to conclude the typing of the document but the lawyers stormed out of his office and went to the chambers of the Judge, demanding to forcefully gain access.

“ Two lawyers who said they are representing the APC in Bayelsa state came to get copies of the interlocutory order issued by the Court last Friday in respect of the supplementary elections in Brass Constituency One.

“I told them to come back the following day as my Lordship said he was still typing the ruling and it was not ready yet, but they dashed out of my office and went to the chambers of the judge attempting to forcefully gain access to his Lordship.”
