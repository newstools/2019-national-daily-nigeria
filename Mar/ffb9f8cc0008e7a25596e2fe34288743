The Senator representing Kaduna Central senatorial zone, Shehu Sani, says the Peoples’ Democratic Party should recall all members of the party between 1999 and 2019 to render the account of their stewardship while at the helms of the country’s affairs.

Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari, who since emerging President of Nigeria in 2015 has consistently blamed PDP for Nigeria’s woes, had again on Thursday insisted that the opposition party still owed Nigerians explanation on how it spent the huge resources that accrued to the country from oil sales.

“PDP has not successfully explained to the country what they did with the money. They said they spent $16 billion on power, but where is the power? The irresponsible expenditure of that period has not been explained, and Nigerians deserve an answer on that terrible mismanagement of the country,” Buhari had said.

Responding to the statement via his Twitter handle, Sani agreed with the President but advised the PDP on how to go about giving account of the alleged squandering of funds during the 16 years it was in control of the federation.

“I support the President’s demand that the PDP should explain how they squandered $592 billion.

“I advise the opposition party to recall all its past and present members (1999 to 2015), to prepare and present to Mr President and the nation a full report of such a monumental waste,” Sani wrote.

Currently, many members of the PDP during the time the party was in power, including several of them with diverse corruption allegations, are now members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
