The 67th birth anniversary of the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has prompted populist skepticism and questions over the real age of the renowned politician and former Governor of Lagos State. Several Nigerians took to their social media platforms to express their doubts over the age of the politician who is celebrating 67 years in March 2019. The people raised questions of integrity in relation to claims of age or pretenses of celebrating false age.
The inquisitive Nigerians observed that the first wife of Tinubu died at the age of 74 years, while the first son died at 43 years, yet, Tinubu is marking 67 years birthday in 2019. Some pointed out that the renowned politician couldn’t be the age he is claiming, being 24 years older than his son and many years younger than the first wife. Thus, some were projecting early 80s while others were estimating him to be in the late 70s.
While some expressed doubt, some others argued that it could be possible to have the margin of age difference with the son; noting that he could have started family life at an early age of 24 years.  They also noted that there are cases where some men marry women older than them for whatever reasons, which they said, may not exclude Tinubu. Though, the debate went on, but the man should be allowed to live his life.
