The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibadan Zonal Office on Monday arraigned Segun Isaac, Olamide Samuel and Babatunde Afeez before Justice P. I. Ajoko of the Federal High Court sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State.
They were arraigned separately before the judge, and charged with different offences, all bordering on obtaining money by false pretence and possession of fraudulent documents.
While Segun was charged on a two-count charge, Olamide is facing a five-count charge. Babatunde is accused of a seven-count charge.
They all pleaded “not guilty” to their respective charges.
Counsel prosecuting the first and second defendants, Sanusi Galadanchi, and his counterpart prosecuting the third defendant, Shamsudeen Bashir, both prayed the court for a hearing date and also for an order to remand the defendants in prison.
The defence counsel for the three defendants, E.E. Jacob, however, informed the court that he had bail applications for his clients.
Justice Ajoko adjourned the case of the first and second defendants to March 20, 2019 for hearing of the bail applications, and April 12, 2019 for trial.
He equally adjourned the case of the third defendant to March 19, 2019 for hearing of bail application and April 12, 2019 for trial, and thereafter ordered that the defendants be remanded in prison pending the hearing of their bail applications.
