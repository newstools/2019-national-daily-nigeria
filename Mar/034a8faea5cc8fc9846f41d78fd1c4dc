Serge Gnabry has signed a new three-year contract extension at Bayern Munich which will keep him at the club until the end of the 2022-2023 season.
The 23-year-old has become an integral part of Niko Kovac’s side since breaking into the team at the start of the season.
Gnabry has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for Die Roten this campaign and the Germany international’s performances have earned him a new deal at the Allianz Arena.
He told the club’s official website: “I’m feeling very, very much at home here. It’s great fun to play for this team. Of course I hope for many titles and great moments, and I’m looking forward to a good future with FC Bayern.
“In terms of football, things are going very well for me at the moment, but I know I still have room for improvement and that I’ll have to continue to get better.”
Gnabry came through the academy at Stuttgart before Arsenal signed the forward as a 16-year-old in 2011, but he struggled for first-team football and was offloaded to Werder Bremen in August 2016.
He lasted just one season at the Weserstadion before joining Bayern, although he had to bide his time with a fruitful loan spell at Hoffenheim last season, where he netted 10 times in 26 games in all competitions.
