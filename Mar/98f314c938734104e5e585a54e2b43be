Feels good to be back talking football predictions and match analysis. It’s also great to be done with the international break, now we can enjoy club football from the various amazing leagues in the world.

Fulham Vs ManCity
For the EPL, I am sure of Manchester City winning Fulham and also for an outcome of more than two goals. Pep Guardiola knows goals may be the decider of who eventually wins the EPL this season as they are closely followed by Liverpool. Like I said after week 3 of the EPL season, it’s a two-team race in the English Premier League. However, I can yet say, for now, that Man City will win.

Juventus Vs Empoli
Everyone is scared of adding Juve to their bet slip. Why? Well, since Cristiano Ronaldo has started his Serie A resting program towards being 100% fit for the UCL games. People don’t trust Juve to win without their great striker.
And this is coming from a recent loss to Genoa as a result of resting Ronaldo.
But I believe Juve will win today. It is a sure win for them.

Barcelona Vs Espanyol
Barcelona will in this match with nothing less than two goals. With or without Messi, this is one local derby that usually raises a lot of dust. But Barca has always shown dominance and superiority over their Catalonian rivals.
The bookmakers expect this game to be tough for Barca (because Barca always struggle after international breaks with their derby rivals). So the points are favourable. I advice you take it. The other very risky option I think you can try is Barca winning to nil. That is, Espanyol won’t score any goal in this match.

The Barca Goal Keeper and defence are in the form of their life at the moment.
