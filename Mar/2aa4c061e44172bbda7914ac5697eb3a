The Lagos State Building Control Agency has commenced demolition of defective buildings within Lagos Island.
About 180 houses will be demolished in the exercise, the General Manager of LASBCA, Mr. Lekan Shodeinde, revealed.
Of the 20 buildings marked to be pulled down on Friday (today) alone, only three were accomploshed by the agency.
The demolition, however, continues.
The agencyâ€™s task force began with the demolition of a three-storey building on 60A Freeman Street, Epetedo.
The demolition is necessary following Wednesday building collapse on Massey Street, Ita Faaji, Lagos Island, which killed many pupils and injured others.
