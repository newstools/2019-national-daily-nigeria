Akwa United utility player Ndifreke Effiong has revealed that he is thrilled to earn a surprise call-up to the Super Eagles for matches against Seychelles and Egypt.
Effiong, who is comfortable in defence, midfield and even attack, was named as a late replacement for injured Torino defender Ola Aina.
The 2016 Rio Olympics bronze medalist  “To be sincere, i never expected the call-up.
“This is my first invitation to the super Eagles and I give God the glory. Hard work pays.
“This is an opportunity to make a statement for myself. I am not new in the national set-up having played at the Olympics, U23 AFCON and the All Africa Games.
“I know several players in the Super Eagles like Ogenekaro Etebo, Victor Osimhen and  William Ekong, so it is not going to be strange for me in camp in Asaba.”
Effiong has scored five goals and provided two assists for high-riding Akwa United thus far this season.
