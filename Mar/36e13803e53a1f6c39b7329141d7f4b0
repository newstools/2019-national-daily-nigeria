The Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council on Tuesday called on the Federal Government to reduce tax paid on the importation of sanitary pads to promote menstrual health in the country.
Dr Virginia Kamowa, the Technical Expert on Menstrual Hygiene Management, WSSCC made this call at the ongoing Training of Trainers Workshop on Menstrual Hygiene Management in Makurdi.
According to her, poor access to sanitary materials, potable water and sanitation has been known to be a leading cause of loss of dignity for women and girls.
She noted that countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, and South Africa had reduced such taxes, adding that in the UK, it was compulsory for menstruation education to be taught as a subject in all schools.
She said that this had helped the countries to make policies which had promoted inclusion and better the lives of women and girls.
“A number of countries have started to develop programmes and integrate menstrual hygiene management in their policies including removing taxes for sanitary materials that women use when they are menstruating.
“Recently, the UN Council on Human Rights passed a resolution urging all countries to take decisive action to ensure that women and girls have universal access to information on menstrual products and facilities that are needed for improved menstrual hygiene.
“So, it is important that Nigeria removes such barriers such as taxes, so that women and girls will live better and more productive lives.’’
