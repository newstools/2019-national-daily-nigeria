A looming crises seems to be on the horizon in the search for the Senate President for the ninth National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as the All Progressives Congress is said to be positioning Senator Ahmad Lawan as the next Senate President.

Recall that Senator Ali Ndume has also signified interest in the coveted position, but findings revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari and his ruling All Progressives Congress are pushing for Lawan while dropping the idea of selecting Senator Ali Ndume for the coveted role.

Reports say the decision on Lawan as preferred candidate for Senate President was reached after wide consultations with most APC governors also endorsing him.

Lawan was also said to be selected due to “qualifications, prudence, accountability, loyalty and rich legislative experience”.

It was also learnt that Lawan was preferred by Buhari because he repeatedly told senators-elect during a dinner hosted by the president that he will “like to leave sustainable legacies; and to be remembered for something”.

Ndume however has kicked against the move towards Lawan, as he claims that the president, and the leadership of the APC had given him assurances that he would have a fair shot at the coveted seat.

Many are apprehensive that the tussle may lead to a political crisis within the Senate and the ruling APC, as both men may exploit available avenues to outdo each other to get the support of lawmakers in choosing a new Senate president.
