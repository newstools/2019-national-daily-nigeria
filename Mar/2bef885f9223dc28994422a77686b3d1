Super Eagles call-ups Francis Uzoho, Victor Osimhen, Chiedozie Awaziem and Valentine Ozornwafor trained this evening with the Nigeria U23s in Asaba in a desperate bid by the country to turn around an U23 AFCON qualifier against Libya, National Daily gathered.
Goalkeeper Uzoho was the only one of these players who featured for the Eagles against Seychelles yesterday.
These players are now expected to be drafted to the U23s against Libya on Monday with the hope they reverse the 2-0 loss the team suffered in Tunisia last week.
Goalkeeper Adamu AbubakarÂ  has been suspended for the return leg after he was sent off in the first half of the first game.
