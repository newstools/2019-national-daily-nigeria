Presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party in the February 23 election, Atiku Abubakar, is banking on allegations of certificate scam against President Muhammadu Buhari in the petition filed to challenge the outcome of the 2019 presidential polls.

The PDP is arguing that Buhari was not, in the first place, qualified to run for the office of the President on the grounds that he did not possess the constitutional minimum qualification of a school certificate.

The 141-page petition filed on Monday contained five grounds against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Buhari and the All Progressive Congress (APC) as the first to the third respondents respectively.

The names of 21 Senior Advocates of Nigeria and 18 other lawyers appeared on the petition.

They were led by Mr. Livy Uzoukwu (SAN).

The five grounds of appeal reads, “The 2nd respondent (Buhari) was not duly elected by majority of lawful votes cast at the election.

“The election of the 2nd respondent is invalid by reason of corrupt practices.

“The election of the 2nd Respondent is invalid by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended).

“The 2nd respondent was at the time of the election not qualified to contest the said election.

“The 2nd respondent submitted to the 1st Respondent an affidavit containing false information of a fundamental nature in aid of his qualification for the said election.”
