The National Chairman of Action Peoples Party, Imo Ugochinyere, has insisted the Independent National Electoral Commission lacks powers to deregister some political parties the commissioned said.
According to him, INEC cannot go ahead with the threat because of the failure of some state governors to conduct local government elections.
“INEC cannot, and I repeat, cannot deregister any political party yet because of a clause in the amended Constitution. I dare the commission to try it,” he told journalists in a release in Abuja on Saturday.
“INEC will forever be held legally hostage from deregistering any political party because of the inability of some governors to conduct local government elections which is required by the amended Constitution before INEC can decide to wield the big stick against any party that did not win local government or councillorship seat or score some per cent in local government election.
“So, brothers and sisters, go to sleep and ignore the noisemakers. INEC lacks the power to embark on the exercise yet.
“Political parties that did not win seats cannot be deregistered, going by the provision of the same law INEC wants to rely on which have tied its hands and legs.
“The law said you can deregister a party that did not win or score some certain per cent of votes in national election and local government elections.”
