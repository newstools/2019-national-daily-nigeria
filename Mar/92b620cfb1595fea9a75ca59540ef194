A medical researcher, Bamidele Iwalokun, has advised women against the use of tissue papers as sanitary, saying this could lead severe health complications.

Iwalokun, who is the head, Immunology and Vaccinology Research Department, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, sounded this warning in an interview on Thursday.

“The habit of using tissue paper in form of sanitary pads is a poor hygiene practice on the part of any woman,” he said.

“Because no health policy has supported the use of tissue paper as sanitary pad, so it’s bad behaviour and should not be adopted health wise. It doesn’t have any credibility of use. This should be a way of informing women that it carries a serious public health risk.

He said the practice places such women at risk of having an infection which may pass through the vagina cavity and enter the bloodstream, thereby having a serious health impact.

“Sometimes it may be chronic infections that may not give serious symptoms to warrant going to the hospital, but it is indirectly damaging the reproductive system or that pathway.

“One of them is the Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), many women do not know they have PID until when issues of infertility come up and untreated PID is a major cause of infertility.

“However, women should abstain from the practice of using tissue paper as sanitary pads, in order to avoid such health complications.

“Women should always adopt proper hygiene at all times, especially during the monthly menstrual period.”
