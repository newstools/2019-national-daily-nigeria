The All Progressives Congress (APC) celebrates the defeat of Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State in the governorship election in the state as well as his failure to install his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, as successor.
Accordingly, the APC Restoration Coalition expressed gratitude to the peoples of Imo State and party members for their commitment and resolve in ensuring that Governor Okorocha did not succeed in installing his son-in-law as the governor of the state after his own tenure.
The APC Coalition led by Toe Ekechi blamed the anti-party activities of Governor Okorocha for the defeat of APC in the March 9, 2019, governorship, and House of Assembly elections in the state.
The Coalition enjoined all aggrieved candidates to accept defeat in the spirit of sportsmanship; warning Okorocha not to push Uche Nwosu into challenging the result of the governorship election.
The coalition group, however, wants the incoming administration to be focused and not be distracted.
