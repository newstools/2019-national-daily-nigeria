Operatives of the Nigeria Police fired tear gas at demonstrators, comprising mostly of women, who gathered at the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Sokoto, Sokoto State, to protest the declaration of the March 9, governorship election inconclusive in the state.
The protesters, dominated by women, were denied access to the INEC office, but they insisted on being given access to the INEC State headquarters in Sokoto.
The female dominated protesters were demanding that one of the candidates, essentially, the leading candidate, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), be declared the winner of the governorship election given the result so far declared by INEC.
Sokoto is one of the six states where the governorship election was declared inconclusive by the INEC. Other states include Benue, Kano, Adamawa, Plateau, and Bauchi.
The protesting women were said to have vehemently demanded the INEC to give them access to the office to enable them submit their petition to the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state.
