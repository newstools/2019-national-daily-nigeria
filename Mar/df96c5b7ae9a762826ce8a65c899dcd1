The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Chief Akin Oke, on Wednesday, said his party may challenge the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections in the state.
Oke, who made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), however, urged party members to remain calm and supportive.
“I want to thank our party members, particularly those of them who supported and voted for the party.
“I ask them to be courageous; we will do all that is needful. If we discover that there is something unlawful in the process of the elections, we will go by lawful means.
“Our legal team is studying the result and the situation, if there is genuine need, then we will go through the legal process,” he said.
