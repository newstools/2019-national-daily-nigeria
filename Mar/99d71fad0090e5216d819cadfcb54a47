Suspected Boko Haram insurgents on Thursday invaded Chibok local government in Borno state burning houses and shooting sporadically leaving many villagers running for safety.

Recall that Chibok came to limelight when the group attacked Government  Secondary School in the town and kidnapped 276 secondary school girls.

The latest attack, according to eyewitnesses started around 5pm. “They came in tens of motorcycles. They started shooting and setting houses ablaze,” a resident said.

Gatamwarwa is about 19 kilometres away from Chibok town.

Sources said that troops from 117 battalion in Chibok and 115 battalion in Askira have moved in to repel the attack.

In December, the insurgents attacked Makalama, another village in Gatamawarwa ward. Bwalakia villagers were also attacked three days after the Makalama attack, burning houses and leaving villagers stranded.

“They looted and burnt everything we have. We don’t have what to eat and we don’t have where to sleep,” one of the victims had told TheCable.

In November, Abubakar Elkanemi, shehu of Borno, had said the people of the state were still under Boko Haram siege.

As of the time this report was filed, Sagir Musa, army spokesman, had not responded to messages seeking information on the recent attack.
