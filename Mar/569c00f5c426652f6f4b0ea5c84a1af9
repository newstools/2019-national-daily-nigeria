The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room has called on security agencies involved in the conduct of Saturdayâ€™s supplementary elections to be professional in carrying out their duties.
The call was made by the convener of the Situation Room, Clement Nwankwo, in Abuja while briefing newsmen on the preliminary report of the body on the supplementary elections.
Nwankwo said it will be illegal for security agents to operate outside the roles stipulated for them by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.
Members of the Situation Room have also expressed concern over the escalating judicial involvement in electoral issues in a manner which they noted, is weakening the system.
The situation room also called on political parties and their candidates to desist from perpetrating violence, vote buying and other electoral malpractices.
