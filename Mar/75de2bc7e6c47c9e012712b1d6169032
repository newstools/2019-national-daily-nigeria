Manchester City midfielder, Kevin De Bruyne, has said that any of his team-mates struggling to cope with the pressure of the Premier League title race, should leave the club.
City are currently in second place, one point behind Liverpool, with 10 fixtures left.
Pep Guardiola’s team face a bigger challenge for the title than last season when they finished top with a 19-point advantage.
And De Bruyne has warned that City players are at the wrong club if they are not ready to step up to the challenge.
“We just need to look at ourselves.
“The schedule is so tough. We are there in every competition and playing well and winning so we just need to keep going.
“If you come here and don’t enjoy the pressure it’s better to leave!” De Bruyne told Sky Sports.
