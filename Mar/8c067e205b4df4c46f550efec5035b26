Cristiano Ronaldo was back to justify his status as the best ever in Europe’s elite competition as his hat-trick overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Atletico Madrid to send Juventus into the Champions League last eight.
He brought the tie level with two headers on either side of half time, before capping off a remarkable performance by smashing in the tie-winner from the spot four minutes from time.
It was his 124th goal in the Champions League and eighth hat-trick in the competition.
Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City underlined their credentials as one of the favourites in the competition by thumping Bundesliga’s Schalke, 7-0. The Citizens won the tie on aggregate comprehensively(9-1). After their last-gasp win in the reverse fixture, they were ruthless at home, with Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Bernado Silva and Gabriel Jesus getting on the scoresheet.
