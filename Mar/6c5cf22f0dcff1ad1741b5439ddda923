Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State on Tuesday stated that he is deeply worried about the deteriorating security challenge in the state.
Governor Masari after a meeting with Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo at the State House, Abuja, on Tuesday, remarked that he was at the Presidential Villa to seek help from the federal government.
Masari noted that he will also meet with heads of some security agencies before departing Abuja for Katsina.
He said the growing insecurity in the state will be tackled before it gets to an alarming proportion.
Katsina is among the states in the northwest where bandits have been on rampage and causing nightmare for residents. The bandits not only go on robbery, they further engage in killing of innocent citizens and destruction of property.
Governor Masari had towards the end of 2018, organized a security summit in the state with several stakeholders including traditional rulers and some security operatives. They come up with a communique which the governor promised to submit to President Muhammadu Buhari.
