The Obong of Calabar and grand patriarch of Efik, Eburutu Edidem Ekpo Okon Abasi Otu (V), has directed all Efik sons and daughters to vote for Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State in the Saturday governorship and state house of assembly elections.
The first class monarch said this when he received the governor in his palace in the company of some high chiefs of the Obong- in- council.
The Efik monarch said giving the achievements of the governor in three and half years, his proclamation will guarantee his re-election come Saturday, saying the palace supports power rotation in Cross-river.
Professor Ayade told the Obong and Etubom in council that his vision and master plan was to create a new Cross river state that would shift from the third world to the first world noting that he is a governor with the fear of God who is committed to the industrialization of the state thereby creating jobs for the teeming youths.
The Obong’s endorsement rounded up the consultations and visitations of the governor to royal fathers ahead of Saturday’s governorship election.
