The Nigeria Immigration Service has announced the postponement of new 10-year enhanced E-passport earlier scheduled to roll out in March.
The Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede, in a statement by the Service Public Relations Officer, James Sunday, said the roll-out of the new 10-year enhanced E-passport has been rescheduled for April 29, 2019, to enable the integration of the National Identity Number (NIN), with the new passport.
Nigeria Immigration, however, said the price of the current passport remains the same and applicants are encouraged to visit the service website for further information on fees payable and application processes.
