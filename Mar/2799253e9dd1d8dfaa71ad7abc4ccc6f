Some members of the APC and PDP are fasting and praying now to get a favourable judgment by the  Election Petitions Tribunal on  PDP’s  Ademola Adeleke’s petition against Adegboyega Oyetola’s election as Osun State governor last year.
The tribunal sitting in Abuja on Tuesday informed both parties to the case that it would give judgement on the Adeleke’s petition against Oyetola of the APC on Friday.

In a  statement by the Osun State chairman of the PDP, Mr  Soji Adagunodo, menbers were directed to fast and pray on Thursday ahead of the ruling.
 
Also, two  APC groups –Asiwaju Grassroots Foundation and Giomania – said they would hold a special prayer session on Thursday to seek the face of God for a favourable judgement on the case.
The groups in a statement jointly signed by their coordinators, Sikiru Tijani and Abdul Adegboyega, said, “This prayer became imperative because we cannot afford to take the state which has been experiencing a  monumental development in the last eight years back to abject poverty and penury.
“Our prayer will surely be answered because God is not unjust. We believe in the efficacy of prayer. Since we are on the right side of justice, victory is guaranteed.
“We believe so much in our party and we are very optimistic that the judgement will favour us. “The people of Osun have spoken through their votes, they turned out massively during the election to elect  Oyetola. So there is no cause for alarm.”
