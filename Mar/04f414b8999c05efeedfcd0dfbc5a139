President Muhammadu Buhari has hosted traditional rulers across the country at the State house, Abuja, requesting them to be prepared to play a crucial role in the prevention and detection of criminal activities in their domains.
While receiving members of the National Council of Traditional Rulers led by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III, at State House, Abuja, the President noted that involving the royal fathers had become necessary in view of the deep knowledge of their localities.
President Buhari listed several significant efforts by his administration to enhance national security while emphasizing the overall need for stability in the country.
The Sultan of Sokoto and Co-Chairman of the Council told President Buhari that the body “on behalf of all the traditional rulers in Nigeria, was at the Villa to congratulate him on his re-election as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
Urging “all Nigerians to accept the election result as the will of God,” the Sultan assured the President of the traditional rulers’ “continued unflinching support in your laudable projects, particularly his government’s cardinal objectives of fighting corruption, containing insecurity, generally sanitizing the governance machinery, entrenching discipline, hard work, and peaceful co-existence amongst the citizenry.”
The Co-Chairman of the Council and Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi Ojaja II, assured President Buhari that their members would work very closely with his administration to fight criminal activities.
