In what seems like his first positive step at challenging the election victory of President Muhammadu Buhari, presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party at the last presidential election, Atiku Abubakar on Wednesday secured the permission of the Court of Appeal, sitting in Abuja, to serve his election petition through a substituted service to President Muhammadu Buhari.

Presiding Justice Abdul Aboki on Wednesday said the service would be done through the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, National secretariat located at Blantyre street, Wuse II, Abuja.

He added that the process would be deemed as properly served on Buhari.

Counsel to the Appellant, Chris Uche (SAN) had earlier informed the court that the retinue of aides at the Presidential Villa, Abuja had hindered the service of the petition on Buhari.

Justice Aboki said, “We have a motion exparte for substituted service on the respondent. The motion dated March 22, praying for the leave of the court limiting the application to be taken before the court and granting leave to the petitioner (PDP) to serve Buhari through any officers or officials at his office or party secretariat.”

He added, “After reading the affidavit in support of the motion exparte and, listening to the petitioner’s counsel, we are of the opinion that reliefs sought should be granted.

“Leave is hereby granted permitting the hearing of the petitioner’s exparte motion.”

Atiku is challenging the declaration of President Buhari as the winner of the February 23 presidential election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
