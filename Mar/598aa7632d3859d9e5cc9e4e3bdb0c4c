 Antoine Griezmann is prepared to reduce his annual salary by a huge €7million a year in order to move to Barcelona.
That’s according to Mundo Deportivo in Spain , where their front page for Thursday’s edition states that Griezmann will reduce his earnings from €23million a year to €16million a year to complete his dream move.
The change is due to the wage budgets in place at Barca, and the fact that Atletico Madrid star Griezmann would be leaving a club where he is very much the top dog in order to just become one of a galaxy of stars at Barca.
Griezmann was asked about transfer interest while on international duty with France, and gave it short shrift.
He told Univision : “I’m already used to it and a little bit fed up, every year it’s the same, so I’m used to it.”
However, France teammate and Barca defender Samuel Umtiti did reference the Nou Camp club when discussing Griezmann.
He told Telefoot : “I know Antoine is very happy in Madrid, it’s going well for him, it’s a team that plays for him, and after that, in a career there are choices that we can take and that we can regret.
“But I know he feels good there. He could play in any club around the world because of his qualities, whether in Barcelona or elsewhere, and be happy and successful.”
