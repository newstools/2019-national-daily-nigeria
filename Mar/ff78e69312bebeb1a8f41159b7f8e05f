Ahead of the Governorship and House of Assembly Elections, the Chairman of the Imo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Daniel Nwafor, has accused the Imo State Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of gross disobedience to court order and treatment of the High Court with levity and disdain.
In a letter addressed to the Head of Department (HoD) Election & Party Monitoring, INEC, Owerri, Barrister V. O Nwokeabia, Nwafor alleged that despite the judgment and order of a Federal High Court, Abuja, in suit no: FCT/HC/BW/CV/103/2018, the state INEC, against all known democratic principles, has been treating the court and its judgment with levity.
Nwafor said the Federal High Court Abuja had granted his application seeking, among others, that the Imo State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Francis Chukwuemeka Ezeonu and all the officers in that office recognize him (Nwafor) as the chairman of APC in Imo Sate.
He, however, said “Despite the rule of law slogan of your commission, your office has consistently insulted the court and its judgment and orders. This is shocking coming from a lawyer that the reason for disobeying orders of court and treating the court with levity is that someone is directing you to do so. This is wrong and unacceptable.”
Nwafor reminded the state INEC that Nigeria is governed by laws and “All of us must obe11 “Since the state INEC HoD now claims to be bigger than the court and the laws of the land.
“I am compelled to formally write a petition to the disciplinary committee of the body of lawyers to call you to order while I also continue with the contempt matter.”
