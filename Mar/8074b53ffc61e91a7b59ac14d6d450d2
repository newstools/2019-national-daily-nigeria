A British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) female reporter, Ajoke, has been allegedly slapped by a Lagos politician, Segun Adewale for attempting to video him while he was handing N1000 notes to voters who had just finished voting.

National Daily Newspaper gathered from BBC Pidgin Instagram page on Saturday, March 9, 2019.

According to the Instagram post, which was written in Pidgin, the incident occurred at the Polling Unit at Pleasure bus stop area of Lagos-Abeokuta expressway.

“When he saw that our reporter could see what he was doing, Adewale attacked the BBC reporter. He slapped our reporter and his thugs collected her phone. It was the police there that came to help the reporter get her phone back,” the post revealed.

Adewale, also known as Aeroland, has contested for the Ekiti State governorship position in the past.
