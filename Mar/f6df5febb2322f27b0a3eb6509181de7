A coalition of youth groups of the All Progressives Congress in the north-central has vowed to resist zoning of the Speakership of the House of Representatives in the 9th National Assembly to the South West.
Addressing journalists in Abuja on Saturday at the Stone Edge Hotel, Abuja, the Convener, the North Central APC Young Patriot, Mr. Dominic Alancha, said though the party had yet to officially announce the zoning to the South West, it should not do so to avoid opposition to the party’s candidate like in 2015.
“If the party goes ahead to zone the position of the Speaker to the South West because it wants to foist a particular candidate on lawmakers, disregarding popular support and equitable zoning formula, it will thereby be shortchanging the North Central of its hard-earned right which will be resisted by this group,’ he said.
“One would expect that since the Senate presidency was zoned to the North East being the zone that contributed the highest number of votes after the North West, the speakership position will naturally go to the next in line, the North Central zone, which produced the second largest votes after the North East (2,465,599).
“So, why is the party suddenly shifting the goal post when it comes to zoning the Speakership position by considering the South West that performed less than the North Central and even already has the number two position of a Vice President? ls this an equitable thing to do?”
The APC national leader Bola Tinubu dropped the hint Friday that the party has decoded to hand the NASS leadership position to Sen. Ahmed Lawan and Hon Femi Gbajabiamila.
The party appears to be heading for a similar criss that followed its victory at the general election in 2015.
