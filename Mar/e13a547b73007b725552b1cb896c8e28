Plateau State governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), retired General Jeremiah Useni, has expressed optimism that he would be victorious at the rescheduled supplementary election, assuring that he would lead the PDP to victory in the March 23 supplementary election in the state.
Useni gave the assurance through the Director General of his campaign organisation, Prof. Demis Mai-Lafia.
He urged voters to come out and vote massively for the PDP.
Useni dismissed rumours by the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, that he will not spend money for the re-run election, saying that he will spend the last he has to end APC leadership in the state.
While noting that his restoration agenda is firmly on ground and it will give confidence to Plateau people, and build a secure state, the PDP governorship candidate also appreciated the people of Plateau for the massive support given to him during the governorship poll and urged those in the affected areas to come out and consolidate on the victory of the party during the supplementary election.
The PDP governorship candidate was already in the lead after the collation of results in several parts of the state before the INEC declared the election inconclusive.
