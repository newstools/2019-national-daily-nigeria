The Nigerian Senate has on Wednesday, March 20, condemned the alleged massive use of Nigerian military forces in the just concluded general elections.
 This followed the consideration of a motion on militarisation of Nigeria electoral process sponsored by Senator Dino Melaye and seven others.
 Consequently, the Senate urged the INEC to ensure the unrestricted and consistent application of all electoral laws without bias to a candidate or a party in all elections.
The Senate also directed the committee on INEC to investigate all perceived inconsistent application of electoral laws by INEC in the 2019 elections.
Going further, the senate urged the President Muhammadu Buhari to give assent to the recent amendment to the Electoral Act to ensure a level playing field and adoption of equal standards in our national elections for a strong and peaceful democracy in Nigeria
