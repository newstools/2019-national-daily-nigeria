Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, will leave for Juventus this summer, if the Red Devils failed to finish in the top four, Tuttosport reports.

Pogba has been linked with a return to Serie A for a number of months now especially during Jose Mourinhoâ€™s time.

However, since the Portuguese left United, the speculation surrounding Pogba has seemingly quietened down, with the Frenchman enjoying an impressive season under Ole Gunnar Solksjaer.

But the 25-year-old could still return to Turin this summer if the Premier League side did not secure Champions League football for next season.

United are just a point behind Arsenal in fourth spot in the Premier League, but they face difficult fixtures against Chelsea and Manchester City as well as the Gunners themselves before the season is over.
