No fewer than 36 political parties have declared support for the reelection bid of Governor Samuel Ortom in Saturday’s Governorship and House of Assembly elections.
The political parties under the auspices of Forum of Registered Political Parties, Benue State Chapter, spoke through the forum’s chairman, Mr. Godwin Odeh during a courtesy call on the Governor at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi.
Mr. Odeh stated that they took the decision after carefully assessing the goodwill and efforts of the Governor in the defence of the Benue Valley, stressing that they resolved to channel their networks to mobilise their members to vote for the Governor next Saturday.
He stated that through their expanded networks, they had fought tirelessly to ensure that Benue land was not surrendered to both external and internal oppressors, pointing out that they remained committed to the struggle for a better and free Benue.
Nine governorship candidates of various political parties, as well as many candidates for the National Assembly, who lost in the recent elections also expressed support for the Governor’s reelection.
Those who spoke during the occasion, including Franc Utov and Melvin Ejeh, stated that the margin of Governor Ortom’s victory in next Saturday’s polls would be in ratio of ninety is to ten.
Governor Samuel Ortom expressed appreciation to the various parties and their candidates for their support, stressing that together, they would work to ensure victory for him and the PDP on March 9th, 2019.
The Governor charged the electorate not to be intimidated by threats from the opposition that they would deploy federal might to win the elections, saying Benue people are the might as far as the state is concerned.
