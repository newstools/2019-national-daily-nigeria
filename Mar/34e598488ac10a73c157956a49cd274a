The House of Representatives has put machinery in motion to investigate the deployment and use of military personnel in the 2019 general elections.
Members of the House of Representatives while considering the investigation, demanded the security agencies to intensify efforts to stop the attack and killings going on in Kajuru Local Government Area, Kaduna State.
The reports on military interference in the 2019 general elections generated monumental concerns across the country and in the international community over the credibility of the elections and subversion of the will of the Nigerian people in choosing their leaders. The use of Nigerian military during the elections to unleash violence on the people and members of the opposition political parties in states like Rivers and Bayelsa, in disregard of the Constitution, has been worrisome to several stakeholders.
The House of Representatives has joined the league of stakeholders worried over the claims and counterclaims that some of the men in army uniform were fake soldiers but were never arrested.
The House, as a matter of urgency therefore, set up an ad-hoc committee to investigate the use of the military during the elections.
The House also mandated its relevant committees to thoroughly investigate the attacks and killings in Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State with a view to unravelling the fundamental issues for the unrest.
Over 200 people have been killed since the crisis erupted in February 2019.
