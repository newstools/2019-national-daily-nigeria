Appalled by what he claims were campaigns of calumny against his administration, outgoing governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, has advised the incoming Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration and the Governor-elect, Mr. Seyi Makinde, to stop the personal attacks on him and family.
While alleging that the attacks were not limited to his government but also his family, Ajimobi counseled the incoming administration to focus on development issues instead of its renewed campaign of calumny against his person, and rubbishing his supposed eight-year selfless service to the state.
Ajimobi spoke via a statement by his Special Adviser, Communication and Strategy, Mr Bolaji Tunji, on Tuesday.
He said, “It is disheartening that more than two weeks after the election, the opposition parties, especially the PDP have carried on as if they are still campaigning.
“Now that elections have been won and lost, there should be an end to acrimonious and incendiary comments. Political discussion has moved from the pre-2011 era. Our focus is on politics of issues and development.
“That is what we expect from them, not personal attacks and falsehood-laced statements indicating their unpreparedness for governance.”
He added, “I’m not unaware that during campaigns some politicians adopted the campaign of calumny as strategy believing it would give them undue advantage, but such does not last. What the electorate expects is to be educated on their blueprint for the development of the state.”
Ajimobi, therefore, appealed to traditional and online media players to be circumspect in churning out unverified information.
