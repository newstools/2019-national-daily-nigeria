Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo showed just why he has won four of the last five Champions League on Tuesday night as he inspired the Old Lady to a 3-0 victory by scoring a hat-trick, which secured a 3-2 win on aggregate, National Daily learnt.
That inspired performance caused Diego Maradona to compare the Portuguese and
Lionel Messi.
“There are players who are touched by the magic wand,”
Maradona said after Dorados, the side he coaches, were knocked out of the Copa MX .
“The truth is that us Argentines are proud that Messi is Argentinian and did not go with the Spanish.
“The other is an animal. Ronaldo is pure power and is now also a sorcerer: he said that he’d score three goals and he scored three goals.”
