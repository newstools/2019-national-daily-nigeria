Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha has prayed the Federal High Court Abuja to compel the INEC to issue him with a Certificate of Return as the senator-elect for Imo West Senatorial District.
In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/296/2019, Mr Okorocha argued on Wednesday that INEC has no statutory powers to withhold his Certificate of Return as  a validly elected to occupy the senatorial seat.
He urged the court to declare that the electoral body acted in error when it refused to recognise him, even after the returning officer had declared him the winner.
In Mr Okoracha’s suit filed through his team of lawyers led by Kehinde Ogunwumiju (SAN), INEC was cited as the sole defendant.


Justice Taiwo Taiwo, has fixed April 5 to commence hearing on the matter, according to a report by Vanguard Newspaper.
 
He granted the prayers of an application that was filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate, Jones Onyeriri and that of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Osita Izunaso.
Onyeriri and Izunaso were joined as interested parties in the matter and as 2nd and 3rd defendants, respectively.
INEC refused to recognise Okorocha’s victory because the presiding officer Ibeawuchi Francis claimed she was forced to announce the governor as winner.
