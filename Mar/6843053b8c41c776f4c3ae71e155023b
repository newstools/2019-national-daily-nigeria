The Police in collaboration with the Aladja Community Vigilante as well as executive members of Aladja Community in Udu Local Government Area of Delta State have arrested seventeen suspected cultists in the area.
Two locally-made pistols and two live cartridges were also recovered from the suspected cultists.
The suspected cultists were arrested during a rival cult clash after an exchange of gunfire with the Police and the Vigilante for about ten minutes in different locations within Aladja on Sunday night of March 3.
The Police thereafter raided the hideouts of the arrested suspects, who are members of the Vikings and Dominion Confraternities and recovered the above items.
It was learnt that one of the locally-made pistols recovered allegedly belonged to one Kelvin Obru.
The suspects, who were handed over to the Ovwian/Aladja Police Division this morning, have also been transferred to Asaba for further interrogations and possible prosecution.
This is coming following a rival cult clash between Vikings (Bagga) and Dominion Confraternities, which led to the murder of one Ejovwo Maduku by the Vikings a fortnight ago.
In a reprisal attack, one Omoneweh was killed by Dominion in another clash.
When contacted for comments on the matter after several hours, the Delta State Acting Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Orisewejie Chuks said, “I am making use of this phone and you are disturbing what I am doing. Please call me later. ”
On his part, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Adeyinka Adeleke, promised to confirm the report tomorrow.
CP Adeleke explained that he just returned from Abuja straight to the PTI Conference Centre for President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Delta State
