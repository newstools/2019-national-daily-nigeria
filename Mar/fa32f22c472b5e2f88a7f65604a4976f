Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri has explained why his side defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday night.
A strike from Pedro and an own-goal from Kieran Trippier gave Chelsea all three points against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge.
According to Sarri, Chelsea won against Tottenham because his players asked him “to press a little bit lower” against the visitors.
“At the beginning of the match, we pressed really very high,” Sarri was quoted by Metro UK as saying at post-match.
“We recovered 10 balls in the opposing half. Then it was really very difficult for us because we played 120 minutes three days ago, so the players asked me to press a little bit lower.
“Of course I agreed because they defended really very well.
“But we defended very well in the final as well against City. In the match against Malmo, in the last three matches, we’ve defended very well with a level of application and attention higher than before.
“But I think that the level of aggression we have was good. ‘It’s not enough to say ‘stop Kane’. Kane is a great player, but it’s not enough to say to the defenders: ‘Stop Kane’”.
