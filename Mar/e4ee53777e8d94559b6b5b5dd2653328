FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu will give the green light to the club to put their foot on the gas to sign Matthijs de Ligt from Ajax.
“We have to talk about it from March (signing De Ligt), which is when we take the decisions, but his name is on the table, of course,” said Bartomeu to SER Catalunya radio.
Beyond the president’s quote, SPORT have learned that De Ligt’s fine display convinced Barcelona they should sign him to reinforce the team next season.
In the stands of the Bernabeu, Ramon Planes and the father of Bojan Krkic, to monitor the already-signed De Jong, and De Ligt’s performances.
On the latter they saw a player who, despite his youth, is vital for Ajax and Holland and ready to stay among the elite in his position for the next decade.
They see him as a superb future replacement for Gerard Pique, although it will not be simple to sign him because he will have a lot of succulent offers.
