The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that it was not possible for it to intervene and help Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha on his Certificate of Return travail because he is under suspension.

The embattled outgoing governor has continued to lament the refusal of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue him his certificate of return as Senator-Elect for the Imo West Senatorial district election.

“I cannot understand why an individual’s report of a professor who lied, will now be taken more than the report by the Nigeria Police, State Security Service, that said there was no crisis, everything was peaceful. The returning officer should be called to order.”

Okorocha had continued to openly express worries that INEC refused to issue him the Certificate of Return on a “mere allegation”.

Speaking on the matter on Wednesday at a press conference in Abuja, APC national publicity secretary, Lanre Isa-Onilu, said the governor being aware of his suspension has not reported “his dilemma to the party.”

He added, “We cannot take any position on that now. Governor Okorocha is on suspension. He, too, has not reported the case to us because he knows he is on suspension. Until that is vacated, we can’t handle his case.
