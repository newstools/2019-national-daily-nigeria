The Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT, Danladi Umar, has threatened to imprison journalists who misrepresent the ongoing proceedings in the trial of the suspended Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen.
Umar issued the threat at the beginning of Thursday’s proceedings when he reacted to what he described as some newspapers’ distortions and misrepresentation of the last proceedings of the trial as that will amount to contempt.
Meanwhile, the second prosecution witness was led in evidence by Aliyu Umar shortly after the Tribunal Chairman made his remarks.
In his testimony, the second prosecution witness, a retired director at the Code of Conduct Bureau, Awal Yakassai, said Onnoghen submitted two assets declaration forms for years 2014 and 2018 on December 14, 2016.
Onnoghen is being prosecuted before the CCT by the Federal Government on charges of false and non-declaration of assets.
