The governor of Osun State, Adegboyega Oyetola and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) have run to the Appeal.
Court to upturn the judgement of the Election Petition Tribunal that nullified his election.
The Tribunal had recently voided the election of Oyetola, and declared Ademola Adeleke of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) winner.
The tribunal also asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC to issue Adeleke a certificate of return, as elected governor of Osun State.
But the APC and Oyetola in a 39-ground notice of appeal filed by their team of lawyers, led by Wole Olanipekun have kicked against the judgement, asking the Apeal Court to quash it.
