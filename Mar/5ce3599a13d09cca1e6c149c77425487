Ribadu took second place in the Saturday, February 23 House of Reps election for the constituency – The court decided that the primary election that produced Modibbo as the APC’s candidate was inconclusive.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) rep-elect for the Yola South/Yola North/Girei federal constituency, Abdurrauf Abubakar Modibbo, has been ordered by a Federal High Court sitting in Yola, to vacate his seat.

The court ordered the rep-elect to vacate his seat for the candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Jaafaru Sulaiman Ribadu.

Recall that Ribadu was the runner up in the Saturday, February 23 House of Representatives election for the Yola South/Yola North/Girei federal constituency.
While making the ruling, the court reportedly considered as inconclusive, the primary election that produced Modibbo as the APC’s candidate.

Also in another ruling, a Federal High Court sitting in Jalingo, Taraba state, on Wednesday, March 6, disqualified the APC gubernatorial candidate Alhaji Sani Abubakar Danladi, from contesting the March 9 governorship election.

The ruling, according to the court, was based on alleged falsification of age in the documents which the APC governorship candidate supplied to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
