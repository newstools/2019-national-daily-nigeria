The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has cautioned the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, not to attempt padding Saturdayâ€™s supplementary elections results in favour of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.
PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, warned that the party already has the figures of votes delivered at the polling units in areas where collation of results was suspended.
The PDP, therefore, challenged Chairman of the INEC, Yakubu Mahmood, to ensure strict adherence to the use of card readers in all the elections to avoid jettisoning its purpose as was perceived in previous elections.
INEC is to conduct supplementary elections on Saturday, March 23 in Bauchi, Kano, Sokoto, Benue, Adamawa and Plateau States following the suspension of collation of results process and other electoral malpractices observed by the Commission during the March 9 governorship and state assembly elections.
