Shortcuts can be very important features when working with digital platforms. From Microsoft Word, Medium, to WordPress, keyboard shortcuts simplify life for power users.
Now you’ll be relieved to know that there are dozens of keyboard shortcuts for social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Don’t thank me for this, thank the good folks at Hootsuite.
It’s crazy, but it’s true. Here’s how they work.
Facebook Shortcuts
Facebook with one billion users is an important platform for social media power users. And there are different keyboard shortcuts to help simplify navigation on the platform.
But Facebook keyboard shortcuts differ browser to browser. But the popular syntax is:
Firefox: Shift + Alt + #
Chrome: Alt + #
Note: Replace the ‘#’ with one of the following numbers.
0 – Facebook Help
1 – Home
2 – Timeline
3 – Friends
4 – Inbox
5 – Notifications
6 – Settings
7 – Activity Log
8 – About
9 – Terms

Now this is the really interesting one. Many times Twitter can be such a fast-paced environment with activities popping out from every direction. But thanks to these few shortcuts, Twitter can easily be managed.
