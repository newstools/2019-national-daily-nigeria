Bayern Munich star David Alaba has revealed he is an Arsenal fan – and has opened the door to a move to the Premier League.
The Austrian admits he can ‘imagine’ himself playing in England’s top flight at one of the ‘big clubs’.
Alaba has forged a reputation as one of the world’s top left-backs over the course of his 335-game career with the Bundesliga giants.
The 26-year-old has also said he would be open to a switch to either Real Madrid or Barcelona – but insists he is not looking for a way out of Munich.
“I can imagine trying something else but I really feel very comfortable at Bayern,” he told Bild.
“Every year there a new challenges and new objectives and the pressure will always be there. I’m happy in Munich but of course I can imagine seeing something else [in the future].”
When asked which leagues would be of interest, he added: “Spain, England. In Spain it would be the two big clubs, I guess? Real or Barcelona. Also the big clubs [in England].”
And on Arsenal, he said: “Yes I was [and Arsenal fan as a child]. When you’ve been Arsenal fan as a kid you will be one your whole life in some way.”
Bayern currently sit top of the Bundesliga on goal difference from Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund having wiped out a six-point deficit at the mid-season break.
They are on a six-game winning streak in the league but were knocked out of the Champions League by Liverpoogate
