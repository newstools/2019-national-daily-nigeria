TOTTENHAM are desperate to host the Super Bowl at their new stadium.
The Londoners also want the £850million, 62,000-seat venue to be the home of the first NFL franchise outside the US.
After months of delays, doors were finally opened last Sunday with Tottenham Under-18s beating Southampton U18s.
Spurs’ opening match at the ground is the Premier League clash against Crystal Palace next Wednesday.
But chairman Daniel Levy and his board want the arena — which also houses an artificial NFL pitch under the grass surface — to be much more than just a football stadium.
NFL chiefs ploughed in an estimated £50m to have a separate set of gridiron-sized dressing rooms built.
An artificial pitch is also underneath the retractable grass surface and can be swapped out in around 30 minutes.
Spurs will host two NFL games this autumn and plan to hold two more in each of the next ten years.
The club’s head of business development  Aidan  Mullally said: “From the start we’ve had NFL in mind.
“The anchor tenant is Tottenham Hotspur but this is designed to be a permanent home for the NFL outside the US.
“This stadium is designed with one purpose in mind, to deliver unbelievably good quality events.
“We don’t want our venue holding back on any decision.”
London, which has hosted 24 regular season NFL games since 2007, is the biggest market outside of the US for the NFL.
Fulham owner Shahid Khan, who also owns the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars, previously tried to bring the Super Bowl to London with his failed £1bn bid for Wembley Stadium.
