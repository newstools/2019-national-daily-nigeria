All is now set for the 2019 Warri/Effurun Peace Marathon billed for tomorrow in Warri, Delta State. Over 3,000 elite athletes and fun runners registered to participate in the 10km race billed to start at the Airport Road junction and terminate at the Warri Township Stadium, National Daily gathered.
Among the top Nigerian runners listed for the race are Adamu Muazu, Adamu Shehu, Emmanuel Gwon Gyan, Gideon Goyet, Deborah Pam, Faustina Ogah and Elizabeth Nuhu. They are expected to slug it out for the N300,000 prize money in both male and female categories.
The race, aimed to promote peace and unity in the Warri environs, was started in 2016 and has grown to become one of the long distance races athletes look forward to in Nigeria.
Speaking on the race, CEO of the Warri/Effurun Peace Marathon, Joyce Bozimo said everything had been put in place to ensure a peaceful and successful outing for the athletes and officials.
“Though things are tough with regards to sponsorship, we are pushing ahead. The idea behind the event is what is pushing us on.“We are good to go and I expect the athletes to put in their best and come up with world standard performances,” said Mrs. Bozimo.
Athletes and technical officials are expected to collect their running kits today. The race will be flagged off by a representative of the Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa at 7.am.
