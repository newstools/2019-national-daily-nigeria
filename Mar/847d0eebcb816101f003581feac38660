Labour Party (LP) in Cross River said on Wednesday in Calabar that it would support Gov. Ben Ayade’s re-election on Saturday.
The state Chairman of the party, Mr Baron Eyo, told journalists at the end of its meeting that the party had resolved to throw its weight behind Ayade.
“After our deliberations at the State Working Committee (SWC), we have resolved to mobilise support for the incumbent because he is the only serious candidate.
“Besides that, he has done well to reposition our state and we have no option than to support him.
“The main opposition, the All Progressives Congress (APC), is fighting among themselves, so, the only credible option is the governor; that is why we have decided to endorse him as our candidate,” Eyo said.
According to him, Ayade has promised to return power to the southern senatorial district of the state in 2023.
He said this was in line with the unwritten agreement by political leaders in the state that power should rotate among the three senatorial zones.
Eyo enjoined members of party to mobilise massively across the nook and crannies of Cross River to ensure that the Ayade won the election.
Speaking, the Leader of the party in the state, Mrs Nella Andem’Rabana (SAN) described Ayade as a visionary governor.
According to her, the endorsement had become necessary to give him more time to complete all ongoing projects as well as continue his industrialisation policy.
“Any government that gives opportunity to the youths should be supported and I am fully in support of the reelection of the governor,’’ she said.
The endorsement meeting was attended by party faithful including, party Chairmen in the 18 Local Government Areas of the state and other executive members of the party.
