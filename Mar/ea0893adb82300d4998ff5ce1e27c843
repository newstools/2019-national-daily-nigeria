Federal Bureau of Investigation is now looking into why the charges against Jussie Smollett were suddenly dropped, according to reports.
National Daily learnt that the probe was launched on Wednesday following the culmination of a series of events that not only have Smollett still under the microscope but State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, as well.
The FBI is particularly interested in why there was a decision to let Smollett walk free despite there being evidence to pursue the case.
Foxx went as far as to tell Chicago ABC affiliate WLS-TV that “Based on the facts and the evidence  this office believes that they could prove him guilty.”
Nevertheless, the Bureau has reportedly been working with Chicago police from the beginning of the investigation into Smollett’s hoax.
This has led many to believe that he could still be facing federal charges which include, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, mail fraud or mailing threatening communications.
