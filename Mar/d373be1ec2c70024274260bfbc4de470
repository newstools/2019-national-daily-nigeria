An expert on Norwegian football, Joachim Jonsson, has predicted that Mjondalen will avoid an instant return to the lower league thanks in part to the experience of new signing Akeem Latifu, National Daily gathered.
Highly experienced leftback Latifu recently quit Sogndal to join Mjondalen as a free agent.
“He should be starting for his new team, who ought to cope better in the top league than they did in 2015, when they were promptly relegated.”
Latifu, who has won a handful of caps with the Super Eagles, has previously played in Ukraine, Turkey and Hungary as well as several other Norwegian clubs.
The new Norwegian league season will kick off later this month.
