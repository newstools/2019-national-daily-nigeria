The Court of Appeal on has cleared the APC governorship candidate, Sani Danladi, to participate in Saturdayâ€™s governorship election in Taraba State.
The appeal court in Yola granted a stay of execution of an order of the Federal High Court in Jalingo onThursday. The appeal court panel was presided by Chidi Uwa.
The appeal court granted two orders. One was for the stay of execution of the high court judgement while the second was an order barring INEC and others from implementing the high court judgement.
Danladi was disqualified Wednesday by the high court after he was found culpable of age falsification.
He is one of the major opponents of the incumbent Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku. Mr Ishaku seeks to return as governor on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party in Taraba


Yakubu Maikasuwa, the counsel to Mr Danladi, told BBC Hausa that the ruling sets aside the previous judgement by Federal High Court sitting in Jalingo.
