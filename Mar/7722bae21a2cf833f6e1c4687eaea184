Reports reveal that Imo state residents are taking action into their hands and bidding their current governor, Rochas Okorocha and his dynasty farewell in the most brutal manner.
On March 12, Emeka Ihedioha of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was declared winner of the gubernatorial elections and emerged governor-elect of Imo state after polling 273,404 votes.
While Okorocha’s son-in-law of Action Alliance (AA) emerged second after polling 190,364 votes.
 It appears it was the will of the people for the father-in-law and son-in-law duo to be ousted judging based on their reactions after they apparently lost.
A recent photo and several video clips have shown angry youths destroying and pulling down anything in affiliation with Okorocha and his son-in-law.
It was gathered that many residents stormed the area where Okorocha’s statue is placed and pulled it down.
The authenticity of the image below and the search shows that it is a fresh image and most likely emerged from the location of the statue.

Meanwhile, Uche Nwosu and his father-in-law seem not to backing down without a fight.
 Just recently, the gubernatorial candidate of Action Alliance (AA) in Imo state, said he would challenge the emergence of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)
It was reported that he made this known at a media briefing in Owerri on Tuesday, March 12, alleging that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) compromised the election and denied him the people’s mandate.
It was gathered that Nwosu, a son-in-law to Governor Rochas Okorocha, argued that Ihedioha did not meet the constitutional requirement to have emerged the governor-elect.
