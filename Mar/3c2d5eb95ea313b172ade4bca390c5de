Several residents of the city have been expressing serious concerns that the FCDA went too far in the demolition in the satellite town of Kubwa located some kilometres away in the outskirt Abuja towards Dei Dei unto Zuba, the exit route of the city.
The demolition was gathered to have generated deep discord and dispute between the Social Development Secretariat and the owner of the orphanage on where and who should be responsible for the children who have been rendered homeless.
The bulldozer was said to driven into the orphanage which accommodated over 130 children, including nine infants. The staff of the orphanage were also rendered homeless, all being thrown in chaotic situation.
Residents of the community and sympathizers were said to have been trooping into the location of the bulldozed building that has been home to the orphanage for many years, cursing and expressing bitterness.
It was gathered that there was slight pandemonium when staff of the Social Development Secretariat and owner of the orphanage home engaged in hot argument over where the children will be relocated or resettled.
It was said that in the midst of the confrontations, the children collectively refused to leave the place with the Social Development Secretariat staff, who were said to have left the scene with disappointment after their appeals were rejected by the helpless orphans.
However, there are indications that the FCDA may be considering providing alternation home for the children because of the public uproar but the authorities are yet to make firm commitment.
