The Director-General of the Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, has said that his suspension by the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC, may not be unconnected with those, led by Adams Oshiomhole, who wants to sideline their enemies in this season of contestation.
Okechukwu, who is one of the loyalists of President Muhammadu Buhari in the southeast geo-political zone, wondered how he could be categorized as working against the interest of the party after investing time and resources to campaign vigorously for the party and even set-up the Zikist-Buharist-movement.
He stated that he should not be blamed for the party’s loss in Enugu State as he was instrumental to the most consistent advert placed in several media in the southeast.
