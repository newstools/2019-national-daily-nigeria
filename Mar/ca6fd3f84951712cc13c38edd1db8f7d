Leader of the Our Mumu Don Do social-political movement, Charly Boy has denied receiving any money from the spokesman of Buhari Campaign Organisation, Festus Keyamo.
In series of posts on Instalgram where he broke down in tears, Charly Boy stated that that the allegations were just mere conspiracy and he is still rooted in the cause of fighting for frustrated Nigerians.
The activist had been accused of being paid a nine-figure sum to release a diss song attacking the opposition party and for getting in bed with the ‘oppressors.’
Charly Boy according to reports was to have confirmed in an interview that Keyamo paid him “nine figures” for the right to use the song in which he delivers a scathing criticism of the People’s Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar.
An allegation that has been denied by Keyamo. “Whoever thinks that I would pay a penny for a song by @Areafada1 that disses both the APC and PDP must have his/her head examined,” Keyamo tweeted on Friday.
Apart from Charly Boy suggesting that he was paid, at least, N100 million for the song, the #OurMumuDonDo leader was accused of being a paid agent by Deji Adeyanju, a former PDP social media strategist and a leader of the movement.
It was Adeyanju who first accused Charly Boy of being paid by the Buhari campaign to smear Atiku Abubakar.
He said he quit the group because he was no longer confident in the ability of Charly Boy to lead the group.
In a series of video clips, Charly Boy denied ever receiving money from Keyamo and assured his followers of his commitment to the Our Mumu Don Do movement.
Charly, also claimed that he was aware that Adeyanju showed up with a tape recorder and he decided to play along because he wanted to understand the position of the person he considers a son.
