Liverpool forward, Sadio Mane has spoken on his new role in manager Jurgen Klopp’s formation.
Klopp had demanded that the Senegalese international play a central frontman in Liverpool’s Premier League clash against Watford on Wednesday night.
Mane, who netted a brace in Liverpool’s 5-0 win over Watford, said he is ready to play wherever the manager wants him to play in the Reds’ squad.
Asked of his new role, Mane was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “Trent made a very good cross and I was in the box, I was a lucky boy and I scored. It’s one of [the most inventive goals I’ve scored], yes.
“But the most important thing is the three points and we got it, so I’m happy.
“It was my first time since I came to Liverpool I played centrally.
“I always said I’m here for the team, so I try to play any position the coach asks me to play to help the team.
“We started fast in the game, we moved quickly with and without the ball and created many chances.
“We scored five goals and we deserved the win. “The team was fantastic, everybody played well. It was the key.”
