Ogun State governor-elect, Prince Dapo Abiodun visited President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, along with his deputy, Mrs. Noimot Salako Oyedele.
They presented their INEC certificates of return to the president.
They were led to the State House by All Progressives Congress leader and former Governor of the State, Chief Olusegun Osoba.
The APC in Ogun went into the governorship election fractured, with the incumbent Ibikunle Amosun, backing a rival candidate Abdulkabir Akinlade of Allied Peoples Movement against Abiodun, candidate of the APC.
The crisis before and after the election led to the suspension of Amosun, though he one of the APC senators-elect going to the ninth Assembly.
Osoba and Amosun had been fighting supremacy war over the state party structure, and the series of setback the governor has had taken him down a peg or two on the scale of influence within the APC and at Aso Rock where he was once a fixture.
