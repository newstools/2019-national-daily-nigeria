Two soldiers currently receiving treatment at the intensive Care Unit of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching have accused Governor Nyesom Wike of River state have sponsoring the attack on them during the last governorship and state assembly elections in the state.
In a trendy video confirmed by the spokesman of Division, Nigerian Army, Port Harcourt, Col Aminu Ilyasu, Captain Adams Salami and Corporal Adeosun Adebayo said they were left victims with life-threatening injuries after attackers pounced on them at the Obio/Akpor Local Government Secretariat.
Capt Salami said: “At about 2300 hours, we got information that hoodlums were trying to invade the Obio/Akpor Collation Centre. We were asked to provide security in the area, which we did, with policemen posted there. We agreed that there would be limited access to the premises.
“Five minutes later, the governor’s convoy came with about 30 to 40 cars with hoodlums. Some were in police uniforms, shooting sporadically within the premises. As usual, we decided to step back. I was pleading with them as a soldier to resolve this amicably”
On his part, Corporal Adebayo said: “The policemen in the governor’s convoy started hitting us with their weapons. I could not figure out the reason because nobody asked anybody any question. The policemen were hitting us with the nozzle of their rifles.”
The role of the military in the Rivers State elections has remained a major debacle as both the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and international observers have publicly accused the military of playing an unwholesome role in the polls.
Both the incumbent governor, Nyesom Wike, and his predecessor, Rotimi Amaechi, now a Minister in the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, have been locked in political battle for control of power in Rivers State.
