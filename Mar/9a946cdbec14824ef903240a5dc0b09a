SWAN selected head coach Olanrewaju Yema has called up a 30-man squad in readiness for the March 23rd encounter against a Delta State All Stars selection, National Daily gathered.
The Magate FC coach has called up veteran defender China ‘Baresi’ Acheru, Michael Chukwuebuka, Victor Modo and Tobi ‘Oga Nla’ Adepoju for this all-important encounter.
There is also a return for renowned Pidgin Commentator cum enigmatic forward Benjamin Sawadinho who missed the last game in Asaba against Delta Swan while usual suspects Fisayo Dairo, Damiete Sanipe, Shogo Shodunke, Charles Diya and Owolabi Aleshinloye are also in the mix.
Team’s effervescent top scorer Jesse Adams will miss out due to injury but team captain Andrew Randa insists that though Jesse will be missed, there are capable players who will step in to do the job.
“It is unfortunate that Jesse is out injured but we have to soldier on. We have a very good squad with strikers who are ready to step in and take his place,” Randa, who retired at FC Nasara in 1999 stated.
“We are looking forward to continuing our unbeaten run which dates back to 2017 against Delta All Stars. They are a good team, we respect them but we do not fear them.
“Our coach has been preparing us for this game. The lads are ready to go and I believe we will do well on match day,” he added.
Head coach Olanrewaju Yema is also optimistic his team can keep their unbeaten run against a tough Deltan side despite missing his key striker.
“We have to build on our victory in Uyo and continue with our unbeaten run,” he enthused.
“The lads are excited about the game and cannot wait to pounce on our opponents.
“I have been in touch with everyone and they are all in good shape and high spirits,” the former Kwara United and Crown FC star added.
SWAN Selected Eleven will on Saturday engage Delta All Stars in a novelty game in Asaba as one of the activities taking place around the AFCON 2019 qualifier between Nigeria and Seychelles on Friday, March 22.
