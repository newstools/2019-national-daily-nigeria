Enyimba coach Usman Abdalla has demanded his strikers should start firing the goals again after going several games without finding the back of the net, National Daily gathered.
The seven-time Nigeria champions have kept clean sheets in their last five games, but have also failed to score in three of these matches.
“Now we have to go back again and start scoring again because at the beginning of the season we were scoring and conceding, then we came back not scoring and not conceding,” said Abdalla after Enyimba were held to a scoreless draw at Sunshine Stars on Sunday.
“The defence is doing well but we still have to get some bite in the attack because we only have Bashir (Abdulrahaman) with four goals and Mustapha (Ibrahim) with one and three assists, so we need our strikers to keep on scoring goals. They have to keep on scoring goals.”
The coach further said the target is for Enyimba to qualify for the championship playoff from their abridged Group A.
“The most important thing is to qualify for the playoffs,” he disclosed.
“It doesn’t matter if we are first, second or third; the most important thing is to qualify and that’s what we are trying to do now.”
Enyimba are second in Group A with 16 points from 11 matches.
