An employee of Guaranty Trust Bank, Oluwakayode Fafiyebi, who is under trial for an alleged theft of N314 has been granted N20 million bail on Friday by an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court.
Fafiyebi, a 33-year-old Account Officer with the bank whose address was not given in court, is facing charges of stealing and breach of peace to which he pleaded not guilty.
According to the Prosecutor, ASP Peter Nwangwu, the defendant committed the offences between March 2018 to March 15, 2019 at Guaranty Trust Bank, Ogba Branch, Lagos.
Nwangwu alleged that the defendant, an account officer in the bank, stole N314 million in bits, from a customer’s (name withheld) account.
“The defendant stole the money in bits until the owner of the account noticed some discrepancies in his account details and alerted the bank authorities.
“The defendant used his position as a transaction officer in the bank and unlawfully converted the money to his own property, hence, the report. He was subsequently apprehended by the police for further investigation,” he added.
The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 168 (d) and 287 (7) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
Chief Magistrate Yewande Aje-Afunwa granted the defendant N20 million bail with two sureties in like sum.
She adjourned the case until June 6 for mention.
