For leading his team demonstratively and taking nine wickets during the tournament, Nigeria’s Sylvester Okpe has been named the player of the tournament at the just concluded ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup Africa Qualifiers held in Namibia.
Okpe who led the Nigeria side to victory at the six-nation qualifiers was adjudged the best player as the Nigerian mixed up his attack expertly, and kept the team calm even when they closed in on history to become the first Nigeria team to qualify for any cricket World Cup.
According to ICC Tournament Director, Kuben Pillay said Okpe’s spell against Namibia on the first day of the tournament was telling, as he rifled through the middle-order.
Apart from the wickets, Okpe also scored 111 vital runs for Nigeria, with a highest score of 55 not out.
Highlighting the terrific skill on display at the five-day tournament, Pillay said: “On the field itself, there were some standout performances, like the incredible 102 not out from Zephania Arinaitwe of Uganda. He needed just 40 balls to score his runs on the final day against Tanzania.
“Other notable centuries included Namibia’s Matthew de Gouveia, who notched 102 not out against Sierra Leone, which was full of excellent strokes. Ramon Wilmot, also of Namibia, made a brilliant 132 against Tanzania, and the host’s in general scored heavily throughout the week. Elijah Olaleye made a crucial ton for Nigeria, as his 110 not out against Tanzania, laid the foundation for a fourth win on the trot,” the ICC official added.
On the award list include Namibia’s Divan la Cock who was named the Batsman of the tournament having scored 271 runs, over five matches, with three half-centuries.
The Bowler of the tournament award was won by Nambia’s Mauritius Ngupita, who was always in the wickets.
With an overall haul of 15 wickets for 71 runs from 37.1 overs, the Namibian took his scalps at an astonishing average of 4,71. He also had an economy rate of just 1,91 to the over, as his unerring control hit the spot again and again.
An excited Okpe told NationSport yesterday that the award would spur him on to continue t work harder. “I am so excited and I think this is another motivation for me to work harder and always give my best for the team,” Okpe said.
