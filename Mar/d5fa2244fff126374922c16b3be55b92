Hundreds of women on Thursday staged a protest in Ogu area of Rivers State following alleged arrest of some men in the community.
Among those allegedly arrested were Opekere Nathan, who is an aide to the lawmaker representing Ogu Bolo constituency in the Rivers State House of Assembly, Evans Bipi by unknown gunmen.
One of the leaders of the protest, Christiana Tamunoberetoani, said men in military uniforms invaded the town on Wednesday night and whisked some men away to unknown destination.
She said, “We are here to let the nation know what is happening in Ogu. We are a peaceful community. Last night, some military men came into our community and picked some of our people.
“They broke into their houses and arrested them. They did not even report to the security agencies in our place. As it stands, over seven people have been arrested.
“We are condemning this act of intimidation and we call on the military to stop this unlawful arrested and release our people.”
The women also took their protest to the police station, the DSS office and the Military check point all in Ogu town.
