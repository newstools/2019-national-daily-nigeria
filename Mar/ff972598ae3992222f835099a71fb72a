The slain policewoman was said to have been recently transferred from Benin to Afuze, and was said to have been on duty at the Police Station when the hoodlums struck.
It was gathered that the assailants attacked the DPOâ€™s office with dynamite, before they shot other Police operatives on duty.
Unconfirmed reports had it that the DPO, who had been at home, was lured back to the station under the pretence that he had some visitors.
The gunmen, who were said to be heavily armed, reportedly broke into the cells and released everyone in custody.
