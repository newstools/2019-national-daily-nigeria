Osinbajo said that the terms of reference of the committee were–“to audit and determine the status of implementation of policies, programmes and projects either inherited or commenced by the out-going Administration

According to Osinbajo, in the next few weeks, the team will determine the current status and performance of Federal Government’s projects and programmes relying on submissions made by the various Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs).

He said that aside such submissions, the committee would also do an objective assessment of experts who were already engaged on similar assessments and would be co-opted to assist in the mission.

Osinbajo said that the team would be required to produce a detailed implementation plan based on the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and several documents including the Next Level document.


He said that the committee would also ensure that there was an objective report; very critical analysis and realistic projections.

Osinbajo said that the report would constitute clear guideline for each cabinet minister on ensuring that the incoming government had a clear presentation, ministry by ministry of what government needed to do;  the challenges to be envisaged and the implementation plan.

He said that all members of the committee would be required to work with teams of their own choice but the committee would work with a team of experts which had already been engaged.
