Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has refused to guarantee that Alexandre Lacazette, will start against Rennes tomorrow.
Lacazette was sent off in the first leg of the Gunners’ last 32 match against BATE Borisov and subsequently missed the 3-1 defeat in France last week.
But his initial three-match ban was reduced to just two games by UEFA, meaning he is available once again.
Despite needing two goals, Emery is not going to commit to all-out attack just yet.
“We are playing with different systems, with different players.
“We can play with two strikers, we can play with one. Tomorrow I am thinking not only of the first XI, because I think we are going to need different situations, maybe different systems and maybe different players.
“All players are very important. We can play with Lacazette and Auba, or we could play with one.
“I think we are going to need different possibilities if the match is going one way or another,” Emery told a press conference on Wednesday.
