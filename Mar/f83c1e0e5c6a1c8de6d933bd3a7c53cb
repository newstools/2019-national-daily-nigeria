The Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State, has upheld Senator Buruji Kashamu, representing Ogun East in the National Assembly, as the PDP governorship candidate for Saturday elections in Ogun State.
The court dismissed the suit filed by the factional PDP candidate, Hon. Oladipupo Adebutu, who is contesting the nomination and candidature of Kashamu.
The court held that the reliefs sought by the plaintiff could not be granted because the national leadership of the PDP conducted its primaries in flagrant violation of the judgment of the court.
 Adebutu’s suit challenging the nomination of Senator Buruji Kashamu as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State was, therefore, dismissed by the Federal High Court Abeokuta, Ogun State.
The presiding judge, Justice Abubakar Shittu, in his ruling held that the case was statute-barred, having been caught up with the forth alteration, therefore, the case was an abuse of court process.
Senator Kashamu, however, remarked: “There was no victor, no vanquished. We are all members of the same PDP family. We are better and stronger together in PDP. What is most important is that we are working together, holding reconciliation meetings and strategising together. We are set to deliver the state to PDP on Saturday, the 9th of March, 2019.”
