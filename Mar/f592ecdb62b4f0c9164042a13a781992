UEFA has hit Slavia Prague with a partial stadium closure for their Europa League quarter-final clash against Chelsea next month, National Daily gathered.
The punishment comes after a series of incidents in their round-of-32 tie against Genk on February 14, including setting off fireworks, throwing objects, crowd disturbances and blocked stairways.
UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) has ordered the closure of a number of sections in the Sinobo Stadium for the first leg against Maurizio Sarri’s side on April 11, while fining the club €32,000.
Genk were fined €20,000 after their supporters also set off fireworks and threw objects.
Chelsea have been punished following a pitch invasion in their Europa League tie with Malmo on February 21. The Blues have been handed a €5,000 fine, while their Swedish opponents have been fined €12,500 as a result of their fans setting off fireworks.
