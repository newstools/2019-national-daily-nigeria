The Niger Delta Freedom Volunteer Force (NDFVF), has accused the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike of being responsible for the defeat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar during the just concluded presidential election.
The group claimed that the leadership style of Wike and PDP’s National Chairman, Uche Secondus was responsible for Abubakar’s defeat.
NDFVF stated this in a communiqué jointly signed by its President and the Secretary, Harry Lawson and Preye Wilson and issued at the end of its emergency meeting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
They also congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his re-election for another four years.
NDFVF further urged Abubakar to accept the defeat as the sincere outcome of the exercise.
The communique reads: “Atiku simply lost because Wike and Secondus hijacked the party structure to themselves before the elections, former governor of Ogun state and Director General of Atiku’s presidential campaign, Otunba Gbenga Daniel was nowhere to be found close to him again. It was just impossible for PDP to have won.
“Wike and Secondus in their selfishness sold out the party in Kano state where they would have secured more votes, by insisting that former governor of the State, Rabiu Kwankwaso take fifty five percent (55%) of the state PDP exco.
“This decision infuriated another former governor of the State, Ibrahim Shekarau and forced him out of the party to join the All Progressive Congress (APC), where he delivered the state to President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC, producing the highest votes from all states in the country.”
