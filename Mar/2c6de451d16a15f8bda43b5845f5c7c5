The Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) has cautioned the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) against attacking any Yoruba territory.

Recall that spokesman of IPOB, Emma Powerful, had in a statement frowned on the alleged attack on Igbo ‘stronghold’ areas in Lagos during the presidential and national assembly elections and how they were allegedly prevented from voting for the candidates of their choice.

Powerful had claimed that the attack might have been instigated by some Fulani people, who according to him had in the past carried out such attacks in some parts of the country against Igbo people.

But in its response, a factional OPC president, Rasaq Arogundade, said in a statement that contrary to the claims of Powerful, there was no Igbo stronghold anywhere in Lagos State or any part of Yoruba land, adding that such claims were not true.

“The Igbo are again exhibiting lack of contentment and appreciation of divine goodness in their lives. Where in Igboland are strangers accorded the privileges being enjoyed by Igbo in Lagos and Yorubaland? Igbo have lived peacefully in Lagos and the entire Yorubaland for ages. They carry out their business and own property unmolested.

“As a matter of correction, there is no single Igbo stronghold in Lagos or any other part of Yorubaland. What exist are areas of high concentration of Igbo dwellers, who live side by side other immigrants and indigenes.

“It is no coincidence that Yorubaland (South-West Nigeria) has been the most peaceful part in Nigeria. The relative peace is not because of fear or cowardice but a deliberate policy of our forebears, who after fighting many wars, have resolved to make peaceful and communal living the way of life.

“That we are accommodating and friendly should not be misconstrued as a weakness or sign of timidity as the OPC is fully ready to repel any attack on Yoruba territory from any quarter,” the statement read.
