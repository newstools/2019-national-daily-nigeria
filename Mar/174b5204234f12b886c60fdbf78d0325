The Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has faulted the claim by the Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Agency (KASUPDA) that the Dunamis International Gospel Centre in the state has no valid properties’ documents.
The Christian body said it had gotten enough evidence to show that the general public had been misled on the operation of Dunamis Churches in the state.
CAN chairman in Kaduna State, Rev John Joseph Hayab, told newsmen that the claim by KASUPDA that Dunamis Church was occupying structures without valid papers in the state was misleading.
He, therefore, urged the general public to disregard it.
“Documents at our disposal show that Dunamis Church in Kaduna State followed the right channel. The church commenced paper processes since 2nd May 2015. And as at August 2018, the Church had paid its processing fees. So, why is this issue coming up now? KASUPDA must own up to its errors on this issue in other not to mislead the general public,” the CAN chairman said.
On the claim by KASUPDA that DUNAMIS Church operates illegally in Kaduna State, the CAN chairman said “It is not true. This issue is not about title documents because the Church has followed the process since 2015. Is it every place of worship that have their papers complete? Why only Dunamis? Why not other religious places?”
“To say Dunamis church is operating illegally is the state is not true,(1) Dunamis church is registered with CAC(2) Dunamis is registered church with PFN /CAN at the state level and National of which we as CAN stand to defend the activities and operations of Dunamis as legitimate,” Hayab said.
