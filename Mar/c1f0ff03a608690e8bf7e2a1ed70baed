The Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) has expressed dismay over complaints from her members receiving demand notices for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) payment from some States Government Ministries of Environment.
According to a statement signed by the ALTON Chairman, Engr. Gbenga Adebayo, this development is considered as an aberration of the existing law.
Adeboye noted that ALTON is the industry body of all licensed telecommunications operators in Nigeria.
He said, “It is duly registered under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and interfaces with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and other Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies on behalf of the telecommunication industry.
“ALTON members as responsible corporate citizens of the country that abide with the laws of the land and natural partner in progress has directed the industry body (ALTON) to make clarification on the following issues at stake: That the Federal Ministry of Environment has ceded the EIA oversight functions to some States Ministry of Environment to issue EIA Certification to our members. That some States Ministry of Environment as the case may be can conduct EIA process to our members without recourse to the Federal Ministry of Environment and National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA). That the Statutory responsibility on environmental issues of the Federal Ministry of Environment (FME) has been transferred to the States Government. That the States now have power to collect ecological fund from private sector after payment has been made to them by the Federal Government. We kindly request from the Federal Ministry of Environment to clarify these positions, so to guide us in our dealing with the situation and to advise our members accordingly. Please accept the assurances of our best regards as we await your prompt response.”
