The coach of the Ukrainian national team, Andrei Shevchenko, before the game with Portugal in the framework of the selection for Euro 2020, spoke about the leader rivals Cristiano Ronaldo.
According to the 42-year-old Ukrainian specialist, it is always very difficult to find the right strategy against such players. He noted that he sees no chance if playing with Cristiano individually, so you need to build a game at the expense of collectivism.
“We need to take Cristiano away from our gates. We have seen that he plays well in the penalty area. Hat-trick, which he did in the last match of the Champions League, again says that age is not a hindrance for him. Those are the most remarkable qualities, a great game in the penalty area, ”Shevchenko stressed in the commentary to Futbol 1 TV channel.
