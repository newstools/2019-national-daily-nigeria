The Lagos State University (LASU) has denied the rumour it planned to increase its tuition soon.
The unisversity’s spokesman, Mr Ademola Adekoya, said that the rumour was the handiwork of mischiefmakers.
“The story is not correct. No iota of truth on the increase of school fees,” Adekoya said on Monday.
He said the university’s Governing Council also had not made any recommendation for the increase of school fees.
According to him, the governing council only recently approved an increase on the amount paid on certificates, transcript and other sundry charges as recommended by the Finance and General Purposes Committee of the university.
The university also posted on its official twitter handle @LASUOfficial — “Kindly disregard any information suggesting an increase in the school fees of LASU. School Fees remains unchanged, please.”
A former governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, had on June 11, 2014 announced the reversal of LASU fee which ranged from N197,000 to N350,000 for medical students to the old rate of N25,000 across board.
He increased the fee from N25,000 to N197,000 for Arts and Humanities’ students, and N350,000 for medical students .
But following several protests by students and civil society groups, Fashola effected a reversal of the fee.
LASU’s tuition was increased in 2005 from N250 to N25,000 under former Gov. Bola Tinubu’s regime.
