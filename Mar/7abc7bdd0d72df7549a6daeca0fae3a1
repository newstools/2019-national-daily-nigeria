The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has protested before the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, the declaration of the governorship election in Adamawa State inconclusive.
The State PDP leadership in Adamawa demanded the commission to rescind its decision and declare the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP candidate, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, winner of the election and as governor-elect in Adamawa State.
Former Governor Boni Haruna at a media interaction, described the decision by INEC to declare the election inconclusive as absurd, unfortunate, and unacceptable.
Haruna stated that reports at the disposal of the PDP in Adamawa State indicated that the number of collected PVCs in the 44 cancelled polling units is less than the lead margin declared and as such cannot affect any difference even if the whole votes are given to the All Progressives Congress, APC.
The Adamawa State PDP also revealed that it has uncovered plans by the APC-led government in the state to use the military to intimidate and scare voters in PDP controlled units, warning that such a plan will not work.
The Adamawa PDP also said that the clear lead by the PDP governorship candidate, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, over Governor Umaru Jibrilla Bindo of the APC is a testament to the fact the people of Adamawa have changed an inept, non-performing regime.
While calling on all PDP supporters to remain calm, the former governor prevailed on INEC to do the right thing by returning the PDP candidate as the winner of the governorship election of March 9.
Adamawa PDP Chairman and all members of the PDP executive in the state attended the briefing.
