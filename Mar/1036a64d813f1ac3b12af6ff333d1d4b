Barcelona have reached an agreement to terminate Sergi Samper’s contract with the club, an official statement confirmed on Monday.
The 24-year-old was once considered the successor to Sergio Busquets after progressing from Barcelona’s famed football academy.
However, Samper has suffered several injuries which has disrupted loan spells at Granada and Las Palmas.
The Spanish midfielder was part of the Barcelona first team squad this season but did not make a single appearance.
