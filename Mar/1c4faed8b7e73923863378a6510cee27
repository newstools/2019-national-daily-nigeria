Governor Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar of Zamfara State has appealed to the people of the state to remain calm and be law abiding after the Court of Appeal in Sokoto disqualified the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and other candidates in Zamfara State from participating in the 2019 general elections in the state.
The governor has been consulting with the APC leadership and the President on the judgment. Following the judgment of the Appeal Court, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which had declared the APC candidate winner of the governorship election had withheld the issuance e of certificate of return to the governor-elect. The judicial decision also affect candidates for the state House of Assembly election and others for the National Assembly.
The state APC has been in a serious crisis since the conduct of the party’s primary election which led to series of litigations, courts orders, Judgments and counter-judgments.
In about 24 hours to the Presidential election, a Federal High Court had granted an order directing INEC to accept candidates from the APC and allow them to participate in the election. Consequently, all seats contested for, were won by APC candidates.
The Court of Appeal in Sokoto had on Monday set aside the judgement of the Zamfara State High Court.
