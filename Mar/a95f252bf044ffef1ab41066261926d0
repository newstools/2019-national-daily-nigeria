Opposition parties in Rivers State have lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for suspending the electoral process in the state.
The Governorship Candidates of the parties, including Action Democratic Congress (ADC), Labour Party (LP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) made the commendation on Tuesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt.
The candidates also called on INEC to cancel the governorship election entirely and order a fresh election in the state.
Mr Victor Fingesi of the ADC described the suspension of the process as a welcome development.
Fingesi alleged that the March 9 Governorship and State House of Assembly elections in the state was marred by violence and irregularities.
He further alleged that many thugs, allegedly dressed in military uniforms, were engaged in the process.
He called on the major political stakeholders in Rivers to come to a roundtable to discuss the way out of the current logjam in the state.
Similarly, Mr Isaac Wowon of the LP condemned the brazen show of desperation for power by some politicians.
Wowon called on Nigerians to resist impunity and lawlessness in the electoral process.
Also, Mr Precious Elekima of the SDP called on INEC to declare him winner of the March 9 governorship election.
Elekima claimed that he polled the highest number of votes cast during the election, judging by the results so far collated.
He further called for a summit where politicians and prominent Rivers people would sit to take a stand on how to resolve issues of governance in the state.
