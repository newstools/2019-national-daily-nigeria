The Appeal Court in Port Harcourt has struck out the appeal of Tonye Cole challenging the judgment of the Federal High court that delisted the All Progressives Congress, APC, from the ballot and barred them from participating in the 2019 general elections in Rivers State.

The panel led by Justice Isaiah Akeju in a unanimous judgement struck out the appeal for lack of merit.

The Appeal Court said they align with several judgments and decisions of other courts in the matter and abide with the consequential orders of the Courts.

The judges in the main suit also held that it will be an academic exercise if the court goes into other details of the suit.

The judges further said their reliance on several comments on the matter is to avoid causing confusion on well-decided matters.

In the same vein, the Appeal Court also struck out the matter filed by the APC in Rivers State
