Leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at an emergency meeting resolved to resist the plot of President Muhammadu Buhari to rig the governorship election for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) using the Nigeria Police and the Nigerian Army in Delta State on Saturday. The party leaders chided the President for the resort to deploy massive security operatives to Delta State on Election Day when the state is not at war or infested by security threat as in Zamfara, Borno, Yobe, states etc. the concern is more so after considering the use of security operatives to manipulate elections in several states during the presidential and national assembly elections.
President Buhari, visiting Akwa Ibom State on Monday, being represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, had declared federal government will give special security attention to Delta State during the governorship and house of assembly elections. The president had also boasted that APC will reclaim “stolen mandate” in Akwa Ibom State in response to the defeat of Senator Godswill Akpabio by former Deputy Governor of the state, Chris Ekpeyong.
However, PDP leaders have told Delta indigenes to consolidate on the successes recorded in the presidential and national assembly elections during the Saturday governorship and house fo assembly elections.
The PDP leaders at different stakeholders meetings in the three senatorial districts Delta State passionately appealed to all party members, sympathizers and supporters to ensure a better performance in the March 9 elections in the state.
From Delta South Senatorial District to D3elta Central and Delta North, the PDP leaders reminded party stakeholders that they are not unmindful of the importance of the March 9 elections which they said are the engine room of development and good governance the party has established over the years in the state. PDP leaders further appealed to party stakeholders to remain steadfast and committed to the party’s victory in the Saturday elections.Rounding up the stakeholders meeting in Delta North, the Anioma nation, PDP leaders expressed optimism of total victory in the Saturday governorship and State House of Assemblyelections.
