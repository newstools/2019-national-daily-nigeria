The tension in the Gaza area between Israel and Palestine has continued to rise despite the ceasefire agreement reached by the two warring nations over border dispute. The tension escalated since President Donald Trump recognition of Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights occupied by Israeli.
Israelâ€™s Prime Minister Netanyahu is, therefore, heading back home early to handle tensions with Gaza ahead of elections.
Thus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected back home in the next few hours, cutting short his visit to the United States of America, as tension mounts in the border zone.
Reports had it that Prime Minister Netanyahu boarded a plane after the Israeli army launched attacks into Gaza, hitting several Hamas targets.
An Egyptian-brokered ceasefire is now in place between Hamas and Israel.
