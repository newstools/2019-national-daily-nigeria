Star German footballer Mesut Ozil has sent football kit to a young Kenyan fan, saying he was touched to see the boy in a “self-made” jersey with his number 10, National Daily learnt.
Kenyan sports journalist Erick Njiru photographed Lawrence in December last year, grazing cattle in Nairobi wearing a red shirt with Ozil’s name and number written by hand on the back.
“He told me he loves Mesut OzilR so much (You can see his shirt). Maybe one day this can reach Ozil and get a real Arsenal shirt,” the journalist wrote.
