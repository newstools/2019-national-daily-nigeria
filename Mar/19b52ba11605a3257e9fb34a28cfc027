Imo Gov. Rochas Okorocha is currying favour by excluding President Muhammadu Buhari from what he called “lawlessness” going on in the ruling APC.
The party’s National Working Committee suspended Okorocha, his Ogun counterpart Ibikunle Amosun, and a couple of others for their anti-party activities in the run-up to the Feb 23 election.
The governor, however, believes the party chairman Adams Oshiomhole is the prime mover of the discipline.
Okorocha, in a statement on Sunday by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, said Buhari “is too decent” to be backing Oshiomhole in his unlawful actions.
  The governor said Oshiomhole had done “so many strange things in APC.”
Okorocha described his suspension and that of Amosun, from APC as worrisome.
He said Oshiomhole’s idea of party supremacy was lawlessness.
