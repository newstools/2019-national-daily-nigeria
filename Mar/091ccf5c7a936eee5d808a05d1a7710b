Wayne Rooney has admitted he ‘couldn’t bear’ to see Liverpool win the Premier League.
Having grown up as an Evertonian before becoming a Manchester United legend, Rooney is struggling to come to terms with the fact that the Reds are competing with City to win the title.
The DC United forward told talkSPORT: ‘It’s a great reason to be out the country when those two are going head to head for the title.
‘I hope Man City get over the line before Liverpool. I couldn’t bear to see them win it, it would be a nightmare for any Evertonian.
‘I remember in 2005 they won the Champions League and they’re still talking about it now so it would be another 10 or 15 years of that!’
Rooney is not the only former Manchester United player to voice his preference for City winning the league ahead of Jurgen Klopp’s side.
Rio Ferdinand told the Mirror: ‘The better of the two evils is Manchester City winning the league as I’ve seen it, I’ve been part of it.’
Rooney is plying his trade across the Atlantic for DC United in the MLS and has enjoyed a positive start to the season.
On Sunday he scored his first hat-trick in the US in a 5-0 thrashing of Real Salt Lake. No doubt he’ll be keeping a close eye on events in the Premier League with Liverpool leading City by two points in the table having played a game more.
