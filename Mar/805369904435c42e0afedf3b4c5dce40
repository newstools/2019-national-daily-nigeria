The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate in the Osun State governorship election, Senator Ademola Adeleke, have requested the Osun Governorship Election Tribunal to accept their petition and declare the party and its candidate, Adeleke, winner of the September 22 and 27, 2018 election in the state.
The Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, also told the tribunal to dismiss the petition which he said is full of confusion.
At the Tribunal on Thursday, parties adopted their final written addresses.
Counsel for INEC, Lasco Pwahomdi, urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition with a substantial cost in favour of the electoral umpire.
According to him, the petitioners woefully failed to establish the petition as required by law while counsel for Governor Oyetola, Wole Olanipekun, urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition, due to contradictions.
He said the petitioners presented a different case from what is contained in their pleadings and reliefs.
On his part, the APC counsel, Akin Olujinmi, stated that the testimonies of all the 63 polling agents called by the petitioners had no probative value.
In response, counsel for the petitioners, Onyechi Ikpeazu, urged the tribunal to grant the reliefs sought and uphold the petition.
According to him, Senator Adeleke had satisfied the provisions of the law and ought to have been declared the winner of the election but INEC resolved to declare the election inconclusive.
Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Sirajo Mohammed, adjourned for judgment and a date will be communicated to parties.
