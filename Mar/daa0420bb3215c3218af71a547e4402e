The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Abuja raised alarm that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, is plotting to prevent some of its prominent members from traveling out of the country.
PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, who disclosed this in Abuja also alleged moves by APC to intimidate and strangulate the opposition party.
The PDP also said the ruling APC has concluded plans to scuttle elections in its strongholds using the military and Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to deny the opposition party victory as was done with the presidential and national assembly elections.
The PDP, however, told its supporters to remain steadfast as plans are underway to address issues relating to the elections, particularly, the reclaiming of the stolen mandate.
