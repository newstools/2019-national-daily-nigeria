The National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) has adopted a new technology for HIV screening.
Dr. Yewande Olafa, NACA Assistant Director, Community Prevention and Care Services, disclosed this while speaking with the Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, on Saturday.
Olafa said the new technology was that of a non-blood based test kit, designed to promote privacy and confidence among users. She said that the screening kit was oral based with simplicity, accuracy and speed in ascertaining one’s HIV status.
“It is in line with the commemoration of World Aids Day with the title “Community makes the difference” in which we are engaging the community to help in reduction of HIV spread”.
Olafa urged Nigerians to embrace the new technology for HIV screening, saying that HIV detection was not the end of life.
”If you are positive with oraquick, don’t conclude yet, go for confirmation in a nearby hospital facility,” she said.
