Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State may have recovered some lost ground when some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ankpa jumped the ship of their party to join the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state for the November 16 governorship election.
Governor Bello and his supporters celebrated the defection as an indication of the wide support they are beginning top gain in the state.
Governor Bello, APC leaders, Chairmen of local governments, members of the state executive council, and lawmakers from Kogi State led the train of campaign that stormed Ankpa which has been pulling members of the opposition parties to the ruling party in the state.
The campaign in Ankpa, Kogi East Local Government was said to have bolstered and restored confidence in Governor Bello, APC candidate, and Edward Onoja, deputy governorship candidate in the next week election in Kogi State.
Governor Bello and the APC have been battling to counter prejudices of ethnic politicization in the electioneering campaign.
The governor was said to have vowed to contain the PDP challenge in the election.
