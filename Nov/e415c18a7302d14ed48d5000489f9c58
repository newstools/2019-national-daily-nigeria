Former President Goodluck Jonathan and Rivers Gov. Nyesom Wike were absent at the grand finale of the PDP governorship campaign in Bayelsa State on Wednesday.
There had been a rift between the former president nd his godson Gov. Serake Dickson over the party’s flagbearer.
Wike and his party too have been managing an internal crisis for months now. Moreover, he is loyalist of Jonathan’s.
The rally, however, still held without them, and was led the National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus.
Also present were Governors Aminu Tambuwa; Bauchi, Bala Mohammed, who is the Chairman of the PDP Campaign Council, Emeka Ihediogha and Ifeanyi Okowa, graced the occasion.
Some of the PDP National Assembly members, various youth and women groups, who turned the event to a carnival.
The National Chairman, who presented the flag of the PDP to the party’s governorship candidate, Senator Douye Diri, described Bayelsa as a PDP state and warned security agencies against compromising the election.
He said the APC took the control of the Federal Government from former President Goodluck Jonathan, a son of Bayelsa, so voters should shun the APC.
Secondus said the APC David Lyon was no match for  the candidate of the PDP.
