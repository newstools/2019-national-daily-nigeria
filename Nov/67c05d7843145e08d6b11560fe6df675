A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ibrahim Emokpaire, says those calling for the sack of Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of APC are “detractors that should not be reckoned with”.
Emokpaire who disclosed this on Wednesday while reacting to the internal wrangling within the party, said Oshiomhole is facing from opposition from some members of the party because of his resolve to instill party discipline and supremacy.
The former APC national chairmanship aspirant, and founder of Progressive Solidarity Forum (PSF), recalled that before Oshiomhole’s election, the party had turbulent times, when indiscipline was the order of the day in most of its state chapters across the federation.
“The loss of Rivers and Zamfara states was due to selfishness, greed and indiscipline of individuals in the party which was the hangover from the immediate past national chairman.
“Oshiomole has brought back some discipline in the party and has put in place ground rules of no go areas for it. Since he took over the affairs of the party, he has not lost any off season election as seen in Ekiti, Osun and just recently Kogi and Bayelsa.
“With Oshiomhole at the helm of affairs, opposition are not comfortable because of his doggedness and no nonsense approach, but do-it-right administration,” Emokpaire said.
