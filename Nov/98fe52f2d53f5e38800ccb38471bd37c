The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Kogi State, Natasha Akpoti, has accused Governor Yahaya Bello of masterminding an attack on the party secretariat in Lokoja.
The SDP’s secretariat was attacked by suspected hoodlums in the early hours of Monday.
Speaking to journalists after she visited the office, Akpoti also alleged that there were plans by Governor Bello to attack her convoy, adding that the unfolding event has affirmed the allegation.
According to her, the SDP secretariat was allegedly burnt down by some gunmen suspected to be supporters of the All Progressive Congress (APC), whom she said are purportedly attacking citizens of the state who are not in support of Governor Bello’s second term bid.
She said: “Is this how we are going to sit down and watch the illegality of APC in Kogi State. They invaded our party secretariat with arms, shooting sporadically and destroyed everything and then burnt down the property just because of an election?
