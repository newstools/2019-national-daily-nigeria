The crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) took a new twist on Friday as state chairmen of the part called on the party governors to sack the Director-General of Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman, over his call for the resignation of the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole.
Recall that Lukman, had in a recent statement accused the former Edo State governor of “destroying” the party and asked him to either convene the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting or resign from the position.
But the party chairmen, in a statement by its chairman, Ali Bukar Dalori, and Secretary, Ben Nwoye, respectively urged the governors to sack the director-general, adding that Oshiomhole enjoyed their trust and confidence.
The statement read: “The attention of state chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to a statement credited to one Salihu Lukman, who claimed to be the Director-General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum.
“We have decided to ignore his crass display of ignorance in the past, but as stakeholders in the progressive party, we find his actions and comments very suspicious and one that cannot be said that is coming from anyone close to the APC family.
“The position of the National Chairman of our great party is not a child’s play and we cannot allow it to be demeaned by characters like Salihu Lukman, who as it seems is being used by some disgruntled elements and even the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), with a view to causing disaffection in our great party.”
“We successfully overwhelmed our opponents at the polls, re-electing our dear President, Muhammadu Buhari, maintained our dominance in the states and won an overwhelming majority in the National Assembly.
“The Oshiomhole-led NWC did not relent. They went on to ensure that we avoided what happened in the 8th Assembly where leaders opposed to the developmental strides of our dear President, Buhari emerged as leaders of the party.
