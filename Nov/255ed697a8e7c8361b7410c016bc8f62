Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has relocated to Kogi State to rescue Governor Yahaya Bello. El-Rufai disclosed that he has moved the apparatuses of the government of Kaduna State to Kogi State to ensure the victory of Governor Bello and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16 governorship election in the state.
The Kaduna State governor insisted that he would not treat until he ensures that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is buried in the governorship election in Kogi State.
El-Rufai is the chairman of the APC campaign committee for the Kogi State governorship election. His assignment ought to have terminated with the electioneering campaign but out of desperation and sensibility to the weakness and vulnerability of Governor Bello because of his poor performance in his first tenure, Governor El-Rufai has taken it as a contract to oversee the election processes towards securing victory for Governor Bello and APC, having the federal might at the behest of the ruling APC.
