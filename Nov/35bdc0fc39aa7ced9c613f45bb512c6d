Femi Fani-Kayode has claimed to be in the know of names already penciled down as to replace embattled Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
The former minister urged Nigerians to not pity Osinbajo.
“Over the last two months, despite all pretentions to the contrary, things have gone downhill for him and he appears to be a drowning man,” Fani-Kayode wrote in his recent article.
He added It is only a matter of time before the final offensive and assault is unleashed against him by his traducers in the Presidency, the axe falls and Osinbajo is finally thrown out.
“I have been reliably informed that three names, all from the South West, have been penned down and are all being considered as his possible replacement,” he added.
“If this proves to be true I would not be the least bit surprised because those that ride on the back of the tiger always end up in its stomach.”
Tracing how Osinbajo triggered his own problem, Fani-Kayode lamented that Osinabjo “told lies against ex Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, Vice President Atiku Abubakar and other opposition leaders brandishing them as corrupt and unfit for public office whilst he serves the most corrupt, sectional and oppressive government in our entire history.
“He insulted Afenifere leaders and those that called for restructuring and described them as jobless people that are just seeking for relevance; insulted his own in-law, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, by saying he was wrong when he described Nigeria as a mere geographical expression
“He betrayed his own mentor Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; used his Redeemed Church and his spiritual father to split Christendom and help put in place an evil Antichrist Government.
“I have no sympathy for Osinbajo and I do not think any southermer, Middle Belter or Christian that is in his right mind ought to either.”
