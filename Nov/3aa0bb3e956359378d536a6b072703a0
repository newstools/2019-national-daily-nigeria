Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has declared that there would be no room for any form of godfatherism in Edo State.
The Governor said he would not allow anyone intimidate him, adding that the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adam’s Oshiomhole had outlawed godfatherism in the state.
Obaseki told reporters in Benin City, the Edo State capital, that Oshiomhole, who waged war against the late Chief Tony Anenih, cannot replace him as a godfather.
The governor who acknowledged the reality of crisis in the chapter blamed Oshiomhole for the conflict. Obaseki said he was not aware of moves by the PDP chieftain, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to defect to the APC.
The governor also warned some APC members in the state who were creating a parallel group under the aegis of Edo People Movement (EPM), saying the constitution of APC did not support parallel bodies.
“There are a few bad eggs in the party who now have another name for themselves. However, in the constitution of the APC, there is no provision for a pressure group within the party.
“So, these people who have alienated themselves from the party are very minute in number and they don’t in anyway represent the voice of the larger majority of the party members who are solidly behind the governor.”
