The International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), has acknowledged receipt of the full payment of $130,000, being grants overpayment it erroneously made to the Athletes Federation of Nigeria (AFN).
The IAAF had mistakenly paid the money into the AFN’s account two years ago, overpaying an annual grant it pays to member Federations.
In a letter to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Mr. Sunday Dare, the World Athletics body wrote;
“On behalf of President Coe, we acknowledge receipt and thank you for the balance of $65,000 which you recently transferred to World Athletics.
“We confirm that you have now paid us back in full the overpayment of $130,000 which had been made in error in May 2017.
We are extremely grateful for your cooperation in this affair.”
The Minister of Youth and Sports Development had in October, weeks after assuming office and in line with the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration’s fight against corruption, approved funds to repay the IAAF, for the excess fund the World Athletics body mistakenly transferred to Nigeria which had generated a lot of controversy in the media.
Mr. Sunday Dare had hitherto promised the funds whose payment was made more than two years before he assumed office as the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, would be refunded as soon as possible to regain Nigeria’s reputation.
