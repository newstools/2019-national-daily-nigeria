Lionel Messi would clearly be the most deserving winner of the Ballon d’Or despite Virgil van Dijk’s outstanding year, according to Barcelona team-mate Frenkie de Jong.
Liverpool centre-back Van Dijk was long considered the favourite for the prestigious individual honour having helped the Reds to Champions League glory last season.
Van Dijk has also impressed this term as Liverpool – agonisingly pipped to the 2018-19 Premier League title by Manchester City – have surged eight points clear at the summit.
De Jong says there is no doubt Messi deserves the recognition.
“For me, I said it a lot but Messi is the best player in the world so he has to win it,” he said.
“Van Dijk had an amazing season, he is a great defender and one of the best players in the world.
“But Messi is above and he is by far the best.”
“I’m really happy to be here. It’s everything I dreamed of. Of course we can play better, we’re working as hard as we can and hopefully everyone can see [on Wednesday] that we’re improving,” said De Jong.
“We can play better, I think we have an amazing team, most of the best players in the world, so we know we can perform better but we’re winning, first in the most difficult group in the tournament. We’re not doing really, really bad but of course we can do better.
