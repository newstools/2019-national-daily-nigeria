The Golden Eaglets returned from Brazil Thursday night following their elimination from the ongoing FIFA U-17 World Cup and the players’ woes were compounded as the Nigeria Football Federation did not give them a dime as they were sent home.
The players and their officials were dumbfounded after they were told to go to their respective destinations without getting any money from the NFF.
The players had hoped their winning bonuses and allowances would be cleared upon their arrival from Brazil but sources in the team informed Newtelegraph correspondent that they were thoroughly disappointed when the officials of the NFF only promised to get back to them.
The NFF did not give the players money in Brazil despite the fact that the sports ministry provided enough funds to clear their bonuses and allowances up to the final.
“The ministry gave the NFF money for the competition; the minister personally facilitated the provision of the funds so that the kids would be comfortable during the competition but many of us were shocked when the NFF failed to give them money and told the players they would reach out to them later.
“Nigeria’s performance at the Under -17 World Cup calls for a review. Indeed, our football administration at all levels calls for a review. We must exact greater responsibility from those charged with our football administration. Timely payment of salaries and allowances vital,” the minister said.
