Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has condemned the harassment and alleged shooting of protesters by security agents in Abuja who were protesting the continued detention of Omoyele Sowore.
The group which issued the statement in reaction to a viral video in which gunshots were fired at peaceful protesters demanding the release of Sowore and Bakare, called on the United Nations to send investigators to Nigeria to coerce Buhari-led government to obey court orders.
In a post on its official Twitter page, SERAP wrote: “We’ve seen video footage apparently showing the use of lethal and excessive force by Nigerian security agents against peaceful protesters demanding the release of Sowore and Bakare as ordered by the court. We condemn the ruthless violence and shocking abuses against protesters.
“UN should urgently respond to the rule of law and rights crisis in Nigeria and call on the authorities to end this brutality. It is high time to ramp up monitoring on the situation in Nigeria and to send investigators to the country at once.
“We’ve seen a video footage apparently showing the use of lethal and excessive force by Nigerian security agents against peaceful protesters demanding the release of Sowore and Bakare as ordered by the court. We condemn the ruthless violence and shocking abuses against protesters.
“Nigerian authorities should immediately obey ALL court orders and specifically the court order for the release of Sowore and Bakare from arbitrary detention.”
Sowore is currently held in custody of the secret police against a court order.
Last Wednesday, a Federal High Court in Abuja, ordered the release of Sowore alongside Olawale Adebayo.
The DSS was yet to comply with the order and claimed that no surety had come to take Sowore on bail.
Against this backdrop, Sowore’s lawyer, Femi Falana alleged that the DSS was plotting to file fresh charges against his client.
