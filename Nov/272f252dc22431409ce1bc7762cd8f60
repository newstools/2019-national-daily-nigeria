A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has refuted that President Muhammadu Buhari has third term agenda. He expressed his disagreement with Femi Falana SAN who raised the alarm of Buhari’s third term agenda in Lagos last week. Fani-Kayode, however, said that President Buhari has a bigger agenda than third term, noting that the President has  a grand plot to ensure a northern President  succeeds him in 2023. Fani-Kayode declared that Buhari is rather promoting northern agenda to entrench northern domination of the country.
Fani-Kayode in a tweet wrote: “my brother Femi Falana SAN has suggested that Muhammadu Buhari has a third term agenda.  He is wrong. There’s no “third term agenda” but there is a ‘northern agenda’.
“The plan is to ensure that another core northern Muslim from NE or NW takes over from Buhari to finish what he started. “

Falana had at the Colloquium and public presentation of “Testimonies To Courage”, Essaysin honour of  Dapo Olorunyomin, Publisher of Premium Times, in Lagos last Thursday, raised alarm that Buhari is planning third term and is already muscling the media to silent journalists.
Falana had declared: “the media must not be silenced. You may have a third term campaign soon. Very soon, they will destroy all possible opponents. And by the time they bring in the third term agenda, the media would have been gone. But we are not going to allow it. No dictatorship can defeat the Nigerian people. “
