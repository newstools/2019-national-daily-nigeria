The director-general of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) on Thursday declared that the APC governors and party leaders supported his earlier call for the resignation of the party’s national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.
Salihu Lukman based his declaration on the silence of the forum and part leaders after he made the call.
“I have not received any call asking me why I issued the statement. Not one, including governors. There is no meeting of governors where decision was taken on this matter. That is why I am saying that first of all, I am talking as a Nigerian”, he told New Telegraph.
Lukman, however, insisted he has nothing personal against Oshiomhole as he accused the former governor of running the APC without recourse to the National Executive Committee (NEC).
He said he has the rights to complain as a party member, and has his vantage position in the PGF gives him access to sentiments among the leaders and party members alike.
“I thought I needed to make this background clarification because I received calls from people asking me whether the statement was coming from governors or from me as a person,” he said.
“Those issues need not even come up. What is at stake is the substance and content. If anybody wants to dispute it, they should look into the content and I think that is the challenge before us. This is what this country requires.”
Describing Oshiomhole has somebody that lifted him out of obscurity, Lukman said he believe he and the chairman have the same convictions.
“And if I say that I am worried at the direction he is taking the party, I think he himself, should be worried more because this is not the Adams that really, everybody has confidence in,” he added.
The PGF has Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, as chairman, while Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, is the vice chairman.
