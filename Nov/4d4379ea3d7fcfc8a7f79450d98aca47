Chelsea will go into the final Champions League matchday hoping to seal qualification to the knockout stages for the fourth time in five seasons.
Frank Lampard’s side were held to a 2-2 draw by Valencia in a thrilling game at the Mestalla, with the Blues coming from behind after Carlos Soler’s strike with goals from Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic.
But Daniel Wass’ bizarre late goal denied the west London side the chance to seal their progress with a game to spare.
It’s been a rollercoaster ride for the Blues in Group H so far. They began with a home defeat to Valencia before away wins in Lille and at Ajax, and then fought back impressively from 4-1 down to snatch a point against nine-man Ajax on matchday four.
The draw in Spain means the 2012 winners can still qualify – and here’s what they need to seal their place in the next stage of the competition.
The draw means Chelsea and Valencia go into the final game both on eight points.
However, the LaLiga outfit have the better head-to-head which could be crucial come the final matchday, especially if Ajax fail to beat Lille.
But if Chelsea beat Lille at home on December 10, they will qualify for the knockout stages regardless of what happens in Amsterdam.
If the Blues draw, they will need to hope Ajax beat Valencia, allowing them to qualify in second place.
