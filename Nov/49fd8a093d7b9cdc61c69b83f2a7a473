Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has called on Christians in the country to speak truth to power in any position they found themselves, noting that if Jesus Christ were to be in Nigeria at this time, he would not keep quiet on the situation of the country.
Obasanjo, who spoke on Sunday at the 64th Annual Convention of Foursquare Gospel Church at its campground in Ajebo, Ogun State, said clerics in the country need to speak out.
He urged Christians to be like Christ and as well foster unity among themselves, saying that failure to do that might make them become preys to the enemies.
He said: “As Christians, we have to be like Christ as we are transformed into the likeness of Christ or little like Christ. So, in all positions, situations and events, we should be guided.
“If Christ was in this position, in this situation or in this event, what would he have done?
“We have a lot to do in the situation we found ourselves in this country today. And make no mistake about it, if we don’t get together and stay together, we would be devoured and that we should not take lightly.
“For me, if Christ was in Nigeria today, he would not keep quiet. He would say it as it should be said. He would speak truth to power. He would have no fear and he would have no intimidation.
“Children of God, you have a responsibility to do and say what Jesus Christ would have done and said if he was in Nigeria today.”
The convention also featured installation of the new General Overseer of the church, Rev. Samuel Aboyeji, who took over from the immediate-past General Overseer, Rev. Felix Meduoye.
