Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Umara, Saturday recruited 150 Cameroonian vigilantes to flush out remnants of Boko Haram insurgents from the state.
The Cameroonian vigilantes are expected to collaborate with Nigerian hunters and vigilantes working with the military in the counter-insurgency operations in the state.
They were presented with four surveillance vehicles and other fighting equipment at a brief ceremony held in Damasak, headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area of the state.
The Borno State Commissioner for Local Governments and Emirate Affairs, Sugun Mai-Mele and a member of the Borno State House of Assembly, Usman Moruma and other officials of the State Government conducted the exercise.
