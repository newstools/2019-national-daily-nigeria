Real Madrid are preparing to launch a player-plus-cash bid for Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling.
The LaLiga giants want to offer the Premier League champions 70 million plus Gareth Bale, who has been unable to fill the boots of Cristiano Ronaldo at Santiago Bernabeu for Sterling, according to Sky Sports.
According to reports, the Los Blancos will launch a former bid to Pep Guardiola’s side after their representatives will watch Sterling feature for England later this month in Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro at Wembley and Kosovo in Pristina.
The report added that Sterling’s representatives met with Real Madrid general director, Jose Angel Sanchez in the summer regarding a transfer for the England star.
Sterling has been impressive for Man City so far this season.
The 21-year-old scored a hat-trick in City’s 5-1 against Atalanta in the UEFA Champions League last month.
