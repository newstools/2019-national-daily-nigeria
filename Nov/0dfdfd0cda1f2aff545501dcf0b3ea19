Ghana’s Minister of InformationOppong Nkrumah  has called on ECOWAS  to swiftly engage Nigeria on the issue of border closure.
According to a Ghanaian newspaper,  www.ghanaweb.com, Nkrumah, in an interview with journalists, lamented that the border closure was affecting Ghanaian traders.
Nkrumah described the situation as ‘a terrible one.’
He  said a delegation was dispatched to visit the Ghanaian traders who had had their goods locked up at the borders after Nigeria shut its  borders in August.
,“It is very important for ECOWAS as a bloc to engage Nigeria on the closure of the borders because moves like this have a way of negatively impacting the West African Economic Integration project,” he said.
According to him, both Ghana and Nigeria’s cabinets are expected to meet between November 8 and 9, 2019 at the next ECOWAS summit to further address the issue.
Ghanaian traders at Opera Square in Accra are taking it too seriously now as the locked up shops owned by foreigners in the country’s capital on Monday.
