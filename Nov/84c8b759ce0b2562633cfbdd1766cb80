President Muhammadu Buhari has frowned at the interpretation some Nigerians gave the sacking of 35 aides in the office of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
He said what happened was that his government created some ministries and reorganised, adding that it was unfortunate people gave the development ethnic and political dimensions.
A statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, quoted Buhari as giving the explanation while fielding questions from State House correspondents at the Presidential Wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, shortly after his arrival from London on Friday night.
‘‘They said 35 people were sacked in the Vice President’s office. We just created some ministries and we reorganized and people are giving it ethnic and political dimensions. It is unfortunate,’’ Buhari said.
When asked what was next for his administration after a well-deserved rest in London, the President said:
‘‘We are going to work harder and be accountable. We have tried to make Nigerians understand why we do certain things. Accountability from bottom to top is absolutely necessary.
‘‘Whoever is responsible for government property, [should know] it is public property, it is not personal and he has to manage it according to the law.
‘‘That’s what I expect and I think that we have been around long enough to impress on people that we mean what we say.’’
