Kano Gov. Umar Ganduje has demolished property worth N250 million belonging to the Emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II.
According to reports,  the property, located at Ibrahim Dabo Road, was demolished to pave way for the ongoing flyover and underpass being constructed at the Dangi Roundabout area.
The demolition of structures within the land and the fence was supervised by the Commissioner of Works, Engineer Muaz Magaji, on Friday, 15 November, 2019.
Ganduje and the emir have been have been involved in a cloak-and-dagger relationship since the first tenure of the APC governor who made efforts to deposed the emir on corruption grounds.
Days ago, the Kano High Court presided by Justice Usman Na’abba nullified the law that created new emirates and the emirs in Kano–another move of Ganduje towhttle Sanusi powers.
Some officials of the Ministry of Lands, disclosed that Emir Sanusi purchased the 1.2 hectare land in 2010 at the cost of N200 million.
They noted the land was recently valued N250 million at commercial rate, but the state government insisted that payment would be made in accordance with the statutory land rate.
Sanusi’s Chief of Staff, Munir Sanusi, declined comment because the monarch had not given him clearance to speak on the matter.
In his reaction, the commissioner claimed that the Kano government had paid compensation to the emir.
“I can tell you he got the alert. For eight months, this issue has stalled the project, and this project is for public interest. We were even hoping that the Emir would give us the land free to continue with the work”, Magaji said.
“But since he did not give it to us, we decided to engage the service of valuers who valued it according to the statutory land rate because the government does not engage in commercial purchase”.
The commissioner also confirmed that he personally mounted the Grade D9 bulldozer to pull down the said the structures.
But sources say the government paid Sanusi only N4 million.
