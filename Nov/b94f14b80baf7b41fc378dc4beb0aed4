Guardiola confirms that Aguero could miss the Manchester derby
Manchester City boss Guardiola feared the worst when his talisman hobbled off in the 77th minute of Manchester City’s 2-1 win over Chelsea on Saturday.
The tendon injury will see Aguero miss the Manchester derby at the Etihad on December 7, but the issue is better than first thought National Daily further learnt.
Aguero hobbled off against Chelsea
“A few games, I don’t know exactly,” said Guardiola. “He has a tendon problem in front – will be a few games out.”
He added: “We will miss Sergio. We have had some problems with injuries but we will wait for him and meanwhile we have [Gabriel Jesus] and [Raheem] Sterling who can play in that position. We will live without him for a while.”
Both David Silva and Rodri were also forced off against Chelsea, but Guardiola was less concerned for the Spainards.
Providing an update on their conditions on Monday, he added: “We have no other [new] injuries. David Silva [and Rodri] had cramp but he’s okay.”
The Citizens went behind against Chelsea at the Etihad after N’Golo Kante slotted past Ederson after getting the better of Benjamin Mendy.
But Manchester City hit back through Kevin de Bruyne who leveled the scores.
Riyad Mahrez had the final say for the Citizens when he produced a moment of magic to beat two Chelsea defenders and fire City ahead.
Raheem Sterling had the goal in the back of the net late on for City, but it was ruled out by VAR.
