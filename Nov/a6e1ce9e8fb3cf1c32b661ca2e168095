Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is again floundering in another controversy within the presidency, and, as usual, it is about his head-butt with the cabal at Aso Rock, according to reports.
The Nigerian Daily earlier reported that President Muhammadu Buhari approved the sack of 35 staffers of the vice presidency.
Osinbajo had 52, while Buhari has 25
And efforts Osinbajo made head off the sack came a tad too late, especially as Buhari will return to Nigerian on Nov 17.
Some reports said CoS Abba Kyari went ahead with the sack.
“It is true that many of VP’s aides were given termination letters. However, I cannot confirm the exact number because it was not done in public. But you know it is political,” the Punch quoted a source as saying.
“Some of those dismissed are those who had been made redundant since the VP’s duties have been reduced and some of the social investment programmes have been put under other ministries.”
Other appointments were said to have been made for Osinbajo which were never made public.
For instance, the President also appointed four more aides for Osinbajo in August 2019.
Hiring and firing of stffers is part of the duty of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.
But the SGF has no official information for Nigerians n this yet.
Many of the APC critics believe and insist Osinbajo has been relegated at Aso Rock.
But he carries out his constitutional roles as V.P without let or hinderance.
