There is no end in sight for the average Nigerian on the issue of frequent data depletion and overpriced data subscriptions as telecom operators in the country have choose to neglect the call for reduction in data price by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami.
Pantami had in August this year directed the NCC to address the issue of frequent data depletion and overpriced data subscriptions often perpetrated by service providers.
He also set Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets for Chief Executive Officers under the ministry and promised to sanction them if they failed to deliver on his biddings.
Pantami has bitterly complained about this issue in his recent directives. He noted that issue was worrisome, and he was directly affected by the quick data depletion on his MTN line.
“As it is today, people are complaining and it happens to me. I recharge my phone (my data line) and I believe what I use is not up to 20 per cent of what I purchase. This is an issue that is very important,” he stated.
