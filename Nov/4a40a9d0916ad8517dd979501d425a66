Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed he will hand four players debuts in their starting line-up against Astana on Thursday in the Europa League.

Solskjaer has selected an inexperienced team for the trip to Kazakhstan, with his side needing just a point to qualify for the knockout stage.

His 18-man squad includes 10 players yet to make an appearance for United, with the others largely fringe players.

When quizzed on who will be in his starting XI at a press conference on Wednesday, Solskjaer said: “It’s Lee [Grant], you’ll see [Ethan] Laird, [Di’Shon]Bernard and [Dylan] Levitt from the start so you’ll definitely get a few.”

Reserve keeper Grant is the oldest member of United’s squad to make the trip at 36, while the other three players are all in their teens.
