The Senate on Tuesday adopted a bill to set up a commission for the prohibition of hate speeches after the bill was  introduced on the floor of the Senate.
The Bill sponsored by the former Senate spokesman, Senator Abdullahi Sabi, is listed on the order paper and has passed first reading  when the Senate resumed on Tuesday.
Reports indicates the Senate last week, passed through first reading the Protection from internet falsehood and manipulations Bill 2019.
The proposed bill under consideration  seeks to prevent the spreading and broadcasting of false information and manipulations using social media platforms via internet broadcasts and transmissions.
Repirt indicated the Bill is similar and a reminder  of the Social Media Bill which was introduced in the eight assembly but was not passed because of widespread condemnation of the bill which some Nigerians felt was intended to stifle freedom of expression.
