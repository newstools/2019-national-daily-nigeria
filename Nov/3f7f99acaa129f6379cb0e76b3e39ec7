Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyeama, knew he had a trick up his sleeves when he freely airlifted Nigerians caught in the xenophobic attack that recently rocked South Africa
President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has pointed out this on Sunday.
In a series of tweets, the presidential aide said she was not fooled by Onyeama’s “heroism” because she knew something was up, adding that the Air Peace boss knew America had him where they wanted him.
“When the scales suddenly fall off their eyes, we must give it time because it’s either they are pursuing something or something is pursuing them,” she tweeted.
“When AirPeace Proprietor became a “Hero”, I was not fooled. Something was pursuing him. He knew America had him where they wanted him.”
Onyeama was charged with bank fraud and money laundering for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of air-planes.
The US State Department of Justice (DoJ), in a statement posted on its website on Friday, said Air Peace Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, has also been charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.
But, reacting, Onyeama said all money transferred to the US went through the CBN.
He added that the allegations were false and are in no way in line with his character as a person and as a businessman
