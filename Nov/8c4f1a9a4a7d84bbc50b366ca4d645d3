The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday slammed the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, over his statement that President Muhammadu Buhari can rule Nigeria from any part of the world he finds himself.
Oshiomhole during a courtesy visit to the leadership of the National Assembly had commended President Buhari for signing into law the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract, PSC Amended Act in London, saying that   Buhari can rule Nigeria from any part of the world.
“What a shame, Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Tuesday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari can govern Nigeria from any part of the world.
“Oshiomhole made the declaration while berating those criticising Buhari for signing the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Amendment Bill into law in London.
“Sycophant Oshiiomhole should know that there is no where in a civilized democracy that a President of a Country will sign the law of his Country outside his Country.
“The constitution is very clear, in the absent of the President, the Vice President will act as the President,” PDP declared.
