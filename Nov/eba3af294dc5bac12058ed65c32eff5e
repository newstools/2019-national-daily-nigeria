The Senator who is also contesting the Kogi West senatorial election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on November 16 against Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and others, listed basic functions a state government must perform having been given the peoples mandate.

Dino Melaye had declared: “I want to assure you the kind of development we have not seen before; salary payment is compulsory, paramount, mandatory and a must.
“All of una know Yahaya Bello, there is nothing wen I no take better pass am. I tall pass am; I fine pass am; I go school pass am. And if na that one – kere wa, kere wa – forget that one!”
The video trended widely on the social media at the weekend.
