The national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole, has intensified his dispute with the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki. Oshiomhole last Monday succumbed to the pressure from APC governors to convene the partyâ€™s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting or resign, excluded Governor Godwin Obaseki led faction of the APC in Edo State while sending out letters of invitation to State chairmen for the NEC meeting. Oshiomhole rather sent invitation letter to his own faction of the Edo APC.
In the letter invitation to the National Executive Meeting dated November 11, 2019, signed Victor T. Giadom, APC Acting National Secretary, the copy of the Edo APC was addressed to Colonel David Imuse (retired), factional State Chairman in Edo State who was recognized in the letter as Acting Chairman of Edo State APC.
The national secretary had invited the Edo State Acting Chairman on behalf of the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to the NEC meeting scheduled to hold on Friday, November 22, 2019, at 10.00am at NEC Hall, APC National Secretariat, Abuja.
Despite the use of the federal might by Oshiomhole against the Edo State Governor, the APC national chairman, however, lacks the power to exclude or stop Governor Obaseki from the meeting. The governor has automatic qualification for attendance just like other governors in the party. Oshiomhole apparently has limited powers against Governor Obaseki on the NEC meeting. Governors of the party are members of the NEC though Oshiomhole heads the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party which is, however, lower in the hierarchy of the party structures.
It is apparent that the battle for the soul of Edo State between Oshiomhole and Obaseki may have no limit in the activities of the APC both at state and national levels.
