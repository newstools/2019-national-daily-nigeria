The Senate on Monday distanced itself from the Hate Speech Bill now before the lawmakers, saying the idea emanated from a member of the upper legislative chamber.
The Chairman of Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Godiya Akwashiki, who addressed the media on the matter, said the bill was not the idea of the ninth Senate but that of an individual member of the Senate.
According to Akwashiki, the bill is being sponsored solely by the Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, based on his conviction.
He also described as unfortunate, the statement credited to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which insinuated that the bill was a Senate bill skewed to make the alleged third term ambition of President Muhammadu Buhari possible.
Akwashiki said the fate of the bill would be determined on the floor of the Senate after a robust debate by senators.
