Barcelona will be without forward, Ousmane Dembélé, when they take on Atletico Madrid in the La Liga fixture on Sunday night.
Barcelona confirmed that the 22-year-old picked up a right hamstring injury during their 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday.
A statement on Barcelona’s official website read on Saturday: “Ousmane Dembélé is to begin treatment on his right hamstring injury on Sunday, alternating between Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital in Qatar and work closer to home at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper.
The entire recovery programme is being supervised and run by the FC Barcelona medical services.
“The Frenchman was taken off in the 26th minute of FC Barcelona’s Champions League game against Borussia Dortmund. Dembélé has participated in a total of 8 games so far this season: Four in LaLiga and 4 in the Champions League. He has also scored once, against Sevilla at the Camp Nou in the league.
“The initial forecast is that the player will be out of action for around ten weeks.”
