The chairman of the last APC governorship primary election committee in Imo has revealed how Sen. Rochas Okorocha, former governor Imo, offered him $2 million to swing the primary in favour son-in-law, Uche Nwosu.
Ahmed Gulak said he rejected the bribe because of his integrity
“I have no regret of any action I took during the primaries I conducted in Imo State. I don’t expect Okorocha to be happy with me, and I did not go there to make him happy anyway,” he told the Sun
“I went there to do my job and I did it to be best of my knowledge and ability and I came notwithstanding the tempting offer I refused. I can walk the streets of Imo state including Owerri with my shoulders high.
“I may not be perfect as a human being but I did not go there to make him happy. Somebody who offered me up to $2 million to give a certificate of return to his nominee but I turned it down.
He wondered how many people can turn such offer down.
In his reaction, however, Okorocha said Gulak ought to be in jail for what he did in Imo.
He described Gulak was an enemy of democracy who has repeatedly shown that he lacks character.
Okorocha spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuamedo,
“We showed a video of what he did when he came to Imo State. It is laughable he is talking about bribe.
“Nobody can say Okorocha has ever given him or her bribe, so it can’t start with a character like Gulak. He is looking for ways to launder his battered image. He has already destroyed his reputation beyond repair.”
