Former Chelsea star, Loic Remy, has described Super Eagles’ Victor Osimhen as a big potential player. He also noted that the Nigeria international is a “very good scorer.” The France international said he is impressed by Osimhen’s work ethic and hailed Lille for recruiting the former U17 striker.
Remi, who also plays for Lille, told Le10sport, ”Victor was a discovery for everyone. Once again, we must emphasize the recruitment of the club, very wise in its choices.
”I can now detect the big potential players, who are assiduous and serious in what they do. Victor is one of them. ”In training, he puts the intensity; he is a true finisher, a very good scorer. I see him working after the sessions, bodybuilding, taking time to take care of his body.
”He has a complete profile and I promise him a very bright future if he continues with this mentality.
”People sometimes make the comparison between Victor and me, because we are both attackers. But there is no animosity between us. He’s someone I really appreciate.
”On the field, we are also complementary; we have already proved this season when the coach has played us both.”
