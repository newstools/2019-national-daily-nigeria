Federal government have  ordered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to put in place measures to reduce the price of data, for the interest of Nigerians.
The minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami  gave the directive, said his office has been inundated with complaints from concerned Nigerians about the exorbitant cost of data by network providers.
The Minister directed the management of the NCC led by Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye, Board Chairman, during a courtesy visit to work out the modalities with other stakeholders in the industry in the next five working dates.
The Minister said: ”I am urging the management of NCC to work towards reducing the price of data in Nigeria. It is too costly and people are complaining every day.
“If you go to other countries, even countries that are not as largely populated as Nigeria, data prices are not this high.
“I am also a victim of some of the infractions that are so common in the industry. You load your data, but you barely used 20 per cent of it and the entire data is wiped off.”
