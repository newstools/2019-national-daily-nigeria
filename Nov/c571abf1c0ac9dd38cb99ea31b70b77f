Reports reaching National Daily have it that Manchester United have reportedly started preparations to secure the signing of Declan Rice from West Ham.
Declan Rice has remained Solskjaer’s top target
Rice, 20, has emerged as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s top target for next summer – but he could join in the upcoming transfer window.
The Red Devils lack options in the engine room after losing Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini this year.
Solskjaer wants to strengthen his midfield options
Uncertainty over Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba’s futures has further increased the need to reinforce the midfield.
National Daily further gathered from a report by Goal that a swoop for Rice is likely to be made at the end of the season, but preparations are already underway raising hopes of a potential January deal
West Ham would reportedly demand around £80m for the England international.
Despite fevered speculation over his future, Rice insists he is committed to the east Londoners.
“I signed a five year contract with West Ham last year, which will keep me at the club till I’m 24, and for me this is the best place to be right now,” he said.
“I am playing for a manager who has given me my chance and played me week in, week out.
“I’m improving every week and although I see all this speculation, I don’t really think about it too much.
“It’s all talk until something happens – and nothing has – so I’m just focused on West Ham, doing my best and making fans happy.”
