Arsenal are determined to turn around their fortunes with a victory at King Power stadium this weekend.
Meanwhile, National Daily gathered that Unai Emery has revealed Granit Xhaka has made a shocking personal decision not to play part in Arsenal latest quest this weekend.

Granit Xhaka Arsenal future in uncertain despite his excellent return to training

The Swiss midfielder has not featured in any of Arsenal last three matches after his outburst at Gunners fans in the clash with Crystal Palace last month.
Xhaka has since been stripped of the captaincy, with his Arsenal future now hanging in the balance.
National Daily further learnt that despite training all week, Emery claims that Xhaka is not in the right frame of mind for action on Saturday.
When asked at a press conference whether Xhaka would be back in the squad for the trip to the King Power stadium, Emery replied: “Not yet.
Unai Emery claimed that Xhaka has trained well, but not feeling perfect to play for now
“I spoke with him on Tuesday about how he’s feeling now and how he is in his mind.
“He’s working well, he’s training well, but he said to me that he’s not feeling good enough at the moment to play. We are going to wait.”
The timing of Xhaka’s outburst has come at a bad time for Emery, with the Spaniard now under pressure to get a result at Leicester without his key midfielder, if they are to keep their top four hopes alive.
Emery said: “Is this must-win? Yes. But in our mind, for each match it is only to win.
“The most important is our mentality and going there thinking: ‘We are Arsenal.’ And we will go there with confidence and also strong in our mentality to be together to go to work against them.”
Arsenal are said to be considering selling Xhaka in January as his relationship with the club’s supporters remains fractured.
However they are concerned they may have to take a hit on the £30 million they paid for him in 2016, with other clubs aware of his current situation.
