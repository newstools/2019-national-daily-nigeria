Members of ex-Rangers FC led by Nigeria football legend, Christian Chukwu, on Tuesday visited the players of the club during their training session at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium as they prepare for Sunday’s CAFCC opening group game against Egyptian side, Pyramids.
While addressing the players, Chukwu regretted the manner with which the team has been losing league matches in the past few weeks.
However, the former Rangers coach called on the players to change their attitude by raising their game starting from Sunday’s game.
