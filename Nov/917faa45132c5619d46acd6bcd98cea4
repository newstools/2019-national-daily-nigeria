The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has declared that the party is rebuilding its platform to fill the vacuum created by the exit of Osagie Ize Iyamu, PDP governorship candidate in the 2016 election, to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
PDP State Chairman in Edo, Dan Orbih, speaking to PDP members at the State Secretariat in Benin City on Sunday, emphasized the urgent need to re-organize the party after the defection of Ize-Iyamu to APC, adding that the party will make provisions for new members to enjoy all rights, including contesting elections without additional conditions.
Orbih disclosed that the State PDP is considering a review of its constitution on waivers, which will allow new members to contest for key positions in the party.
The PDP is working on strengthening the party in Edo State to maintain and expand its influence in Edo politics, despite the exit of Ize-Iyanu. The party is already working towards the 2020 governorship election in the state.
