The senatorial election in Kogi West on Saturday has been declared inconclusive, and a supplementary election date will be announced.
INECâ€™s returning officer Prof. Olayinde Lawal stated his on Sunday.
According to the election management body, the APC candidate Senator Smart Adeyemi, scored a total of 80,118 votes while the PDP candidate Senator Dino Melaye, scored 59,548 votes.
Lawal said the margin between the candidate of the APC and Melaye is 20,570.
The total margin between both candidates was lower than the 43,127 registered voters in 53 polling units of 20 registration areas in the zone where elections were canceled.
The returning officer said he decided not to declare a winner because of the slim margin between the two leading candidates.
Before the announcement, Melaye had rejected the election, claiming widespread violence, rigging, and collusion between security agents and the APC.
