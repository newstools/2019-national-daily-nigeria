The Big Brother Naija housemate, Khafi Kareem, who was said to have participated in the BBNA 2019 reality show without being authorized by her employers in the United Kingdom, has been reabsorbed into the London Metropolitan Police.
Khafi, marking her 30th birthday was to have acknowledged that she has been told to return to work. She was said to have resumed duty at the UK security outfit two weeks ago.
There were reports she had been a subject of probe by Scotland Yard.
The Mirror of London quoted Khafi as saying she is returning to her beat.
“Work has been really great, we’ve been speaking and communicating, they asked me when I’d be coming back to work.
“I’m not sure when I’m going to go back yet – I want to get back as soon as possible, I’m passionate about keeping London safer,” Kharfi had said.
Kareem, 29, had caused outrage among senior officers by appearing on BBN without permission.
