The All Progressives Congress (APC) received a shocking communication from the court on Thursday notifying the party of the disqualification of its candidate for the Saturday election in Bayelsa State.
Report indicated that earlier on Thursday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), were both served with an Order of the court, disqualifying the APC Governorship candidate, Mr. Lyon David and the Deputy Governorship Candidate, Senator Degi-Eremienyo, from participating in the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State.
Apparently, the development has generated uncertainty in the Bayelsa State APC, culminating in the phobia that the Rivers and Zamfara states tragedies is about to struck the APC in Bayelsa.
The court order may be shocking but not surprising to the APC leaders because of the failure of the party leaders to ensure transparency in the partyâ€™s primary election for nomination of its governorship candidate. The post-primary election crisis precipitated legal suit by the aggrieved party members who challenged the process that led to the emergence of the APC candidate being sponsored by the party for the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State.
