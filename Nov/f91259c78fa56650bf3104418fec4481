The national leader of the APC has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Deep Offshore Act in London.
Bola Tinubu also praised the president’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari who ferried the bill to London for Buhari’s assent on Monday.
While many Nigerians were reacting to Kyari’s action which they believed undermined the office of VP Yemi Osinbjo, Tinubu dodged commenting on the controversy, and focused on the economy
He noted the signing of the bill was a pointer to the fact that Buhari was determined to reform the country’s economy.
According to him, with the action by the National Assembly to improve the outdated Deep Offshore Act through legislative amendment, Nigeria has turned an important corner.
“Billions of dollars that should have landed in our national coffers to fund public infrastructure and essential social services instead found residence in the balance sheets of the oil firms,” he said in an official statement titled The Coming Prosperity he signed on Tuesday.
“This was no attempt to deprive the oil majors. We want the firms to make a just profit for their efforts; however, they have been receiving a surplus at the expense of our minimal developmental needs. This is not as things should be.”
Tinubu likened Buhari to a past American leader who steered the country out of economic doldrums.
Kyari had written an op-ed earlier in ThisDay on the out-moded law, a piece Tinubu described as forward-looking and insightful.
