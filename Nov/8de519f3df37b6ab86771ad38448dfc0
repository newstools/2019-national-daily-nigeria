Rt. Hon Mudashiru Obasa, the Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly and Chairman Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, has asked President Muhammad Buhari to issue an  executive  order  on financial autonomy to state legislatures .

Obasa, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues (Speakers of State Legislatures in Nigeria) during a courtesy visit to Mr President in Aso Rock Villa on Thursday, November 21, wanted Mr President through the executive order to mandate the Accountant General of Federation to deduct allocations for the state legislatures and judiciary for any state that fails to release the budget of State legislatures and judiciary.

Obasa also in his opening address to the president wanted some of the powers in the exclusive legislative list such as police and railway to be devolved to state’s government.
 

He further implored President Muhammad Buhari to create time out of his busy schedule to relate with state legislators in order to understand their progress,  challenges and to share ideas with them .

President Muhammad Buhari in his response urged the lawmakers to always place interest of the people first in all deliberations and negotiations.

The president went further to say that the autonomy of state legislatures had been constrained by the Constitution.
President Buhari in his conclusion said, “I will ensure that we consult your conference to further enhance the positive impact of our interventions across the country.”
