Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho has admitted that Christian Eriksen’s doubtful future with the club will have an affect on his choices going forward.
Eriksen is out of contract with the north London club come the end of the season and it looks likely that he will leave for pastures new. Both Inter and Real Madrid have drawn links to him, as have Manchester United.
“My decisions about starting him or not starting, selecting or not selecting, will be based on a perspective of future. I cannot hide that,” he told the Daily Mail.
“We have a present and in football we have to focus on the present, in this case the game against Olympiakos, but it’s a club where you have to think about the future. These important decisions, obviously, they have an influence on my decisions as a head coach.”
Mourinho, who succeeded Mauricio Pochettino on the bench at Spurs, then went on to insist that the Danish playmaker is committed to the cause despite the question marks surrounding his future.
“Christian is a proper guy, loves the club, loves his colleagues, amazing colleague in the dressing room. So it doesn’t matter what – he’s one of us until the last day.
“The important thing is that he’s committed with us, so let’s not talk about his future. Is he leaving? Is he staying? Let’s talk about his commitment for the club and for his colleagues and for the project. He’s with us.”
