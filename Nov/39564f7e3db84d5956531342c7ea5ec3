Mauricio Pochettino is confident that it will go “massively wrong” for Tottenham Hotspur under Jose Mourinho, according to ESPM.
Mourinho replaced Pochettino earlier this week, after the Argentine was sacked by the club’s chairman Daniel Levy.
Pochettino left less than six months after guiding the club to the Champions League final.
But he elft the club 14th in the table, 11 points behind fourth-placed Manchester City.
However, Pochettino is “confident” that Spurs will continue to go massively wrong during Mourinho’s reign.
Mourinho, meanwhile, is confident that Spurs can be title challengers next season.
“We cannot win the Premier League this season,” Mourinho said this week.
“We can, I’m not saying we will do, we can win it next season.”
