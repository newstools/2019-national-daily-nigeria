Reports reaching National Daily reveal that the Red Devils have been dealt a transfer boost after Red Bull Salzburg sporting director Christoph Freund denied they have a clause to sell United major transfer target Erling Braut Haaland to RB Leipzig for a cut-price fee.
Haaland has remained a huge target for United
Haaland is in-demand with top European clubs with United believing they are at the front of the queue.
National Daily learnt from earlier reports in Germany that Haaland could be on his way to the Bundesliga for a fraction of the fee the Red Devils or other suitors would have to pay.
It was reported that Leipzig – who share owners with Salzburg – had a clause to buy Haaland for just £25.7million.
Yet Freund has denied that is the case, providing hope United are still first in line to land the Norwegian in a £75m deal either in January or next summer. “We would never own any club a right of advance to any player.
“That was not the case in the past and will not be the case in the future.”
Haaland’s father, Alf-Inge, has reportedly visited Carrington as well as Arsenal’s training ground to consider options.

But reports have suggested he has advised his son to first move to the Bundesliga before making the jump to the Premier League.
RB Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche hinted they will be keen on pursuing a move for Haaland, with United and other interested parties facing serious competition.
The boy is a very good player,” he told German outlet Bild.
“Both in the league and in the Champions League, he does an exceptionally good job. Of course, we are already looking around for the summer.”
