Zinedine Zidane has insisted that Kylian Mbappe’s dream is to play for the Spanish giants.
Mbappe was linked with a move from Paris Saint-Germain to Madrid last summer, but ended up staying with the Ligue 1 side.

The Real Madrid handler spoke about Mbappe’s desire to play for Los Blancos.
This comment didn’t go down well with PSG’s sporting director Leonardo.
He cut Zidane shot, warning him against “destabilising” Mbappe.
But Zidane ignored him.
“All I said was something that Kylian Mbappe had already said himself – that it was his dream to one day wear Real Madrid’s white jersey.
“That’s all I said, and I’m saying it again today and I would repeat it again everyday. I have nothing more to say about Leonardo, I can say whatever I want,” Zidane said during Friday’s press conference.
