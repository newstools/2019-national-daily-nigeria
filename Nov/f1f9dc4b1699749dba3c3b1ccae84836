Controversial politician, Dino Melaye, claimed on Wednesday that operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) were heading to his hometown in Aiyetoro, Kogi State, to plant arms in his house.
Melaye, who is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senatorial candidate in Saturday’s rerun election in Kogi State, raised the alarm on his Twitter handle, after news emerged that SARS officials were leaving Lokoja for Aiyetoro.
The sacked lawmaker who warned that the officers would be exposed, claimed that the aim of SARS was to implicate him.
He wrote: “SAS police leaving Lokoja now to go and plant arms in my house in Aiyetoro in other to implicate me. They are many of them. We have planted cameras everywhere. You will be exposed.”
