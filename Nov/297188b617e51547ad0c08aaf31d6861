As the crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) show no signs of abating, Governor Godwin Obaseki has debunked the claims that the embattled National Chairman of the Party and former governor of the state, Adams Oshiomhole made him governor.
Obaseki who stated this at a meeting of the APC leaders in the state held in Benin City, the state capital, emphasised at the meeting that he was not ungrateful to the APC chairman as being insinuated in some quarters.
“I am not an ungrateful person. No one made me governor. I became governor by God’s grace, with the support of many other people. If God had said I would not be governor, no way would I have been governor. It is wrong for someone to say he made me governor.”
Governor Obaseki also denied insinuations that Oshiomhole sponsored his election.
“No one gave me money. The fund Oshiomhole initially raised for his governorship ambition was raised by me in Lagos. If I can raise money for him for his election, why would I not be able to raise money for my own election?”
The governor said the national chairman was not truthful about comments on his administration, adding, “If you came into power on some basic principles, do not expect to change those principles because you have certain ambition. If you came to power believing no man is God, then the day you start to play God, you will get the consequences.”
