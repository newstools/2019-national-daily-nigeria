Action continued on Saturday, November 2, 2019 in the Round of 16 of the Bet9ja Royal Cup with Osevan FC of Kwale and Rolly FC of Koko all progressing to the quarterfinals.
Osevan FC narrowly beat 90FC of Asaba by alone goal in the first game after playing a goalless draw during normal time and taking it to extra time.
Echune Ifeanyi’s solitary effort gave Osevan FC all the needed advantage, as it was enough to stop the tie from being decided via the lottery of penalty kicks.
In the next game, Rolly FC were in their usual element after they sent five goals past Young Stars FC of Ossisa and goalkeeper, Okwuelum Ekene.
Goals from Hassan Lasisi, Osaghae Solomon, Ediake Precious, John Obasi, and Enofe Godwin in either sides of halftime guaranteed safe passage to the quarterfinals and a 5 – 0 triumph over Stars.
The last two Round 16 fixtures will be staged in Warri on Wednesday, November 6, 2019.
Ekete United will take on Mega Stars and Young Shall Grow FC will go up against Delta Eagles FC.
