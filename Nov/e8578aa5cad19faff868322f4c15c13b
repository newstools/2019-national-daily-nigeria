The Ogbolomabiri community in the Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa was caught in a crossfire between supporters of the PDP and the APC during a rally by the ruling party.
Five people got shot, including two policemen and a staffer of the Bayelsa Radio Station who allegedly died on the spot.
The governorship campaign rally of the PDP had to be cancelled then.
It was a detachment of the Nigerian Army that came to douse the tension.
Trouble started when some supporters of one of the political parties started defacing posters and flags of the rival political party at the King Koko Square venue of the rally.
Armed men reportedly started shooting, opening fire on the protocol bus of the Bayelsa State Government House along the junction between Bassambiri and Ogbolomabiri communities.
Confirming the shootings, the incident, spokesperson of the Nembe Chiefs Council, Chief Nengi James, said there was a clash between rival supporters of the PDP and APC in Nembe resulting in injuries.
He however said no death has been recorded.
The senator representing Bayelsa East senatorial district, Senator Nimi Barigha-Amangi, has condemned in its entirety the act of provocation and violence released on the community by supporters of the People Democratic Party (PDP).
He, however, warned that no individual should hide under any political platform to breach the already existing peace and harmonious relationship amongst the people in Nembe.
Governor Seriake Dickson, who was billed to attend the rally in company of the candidate of the party, Senator Douye Diri, however, condemned the Â attack.
