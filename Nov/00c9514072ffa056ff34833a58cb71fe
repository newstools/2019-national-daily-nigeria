The European Union has decried reports of violence and voter intimidation in the November 16 governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.

EU Diplomatic Watch in a statement raised alarm over reports of fatalities and missing people, appealing to stakeholders to call for calm.
The Diplomatic Watch deployed observer  teams from Austria, the European Union Delegation, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States to monitor both governorship  elections on November 16 in Bayelsa and Kogi  states.
“We express our alarm at reports of widespread incidents of violence and intimidation, some of which were witnessed by our teams in Kogi. There are reports of fatalities and people missing, including INEC staff. Our thoughts are with all victims and their families.
“We encourage all stakeholders, in particular, political leaders, to call for calm and we encourage security agencies to investigate thoroughly and bring perpetrators to justice.
“We are also concerned by evident vote-buying and credible reports of ballot box snatching in both Bayelsa and Kogi, the EU declared.
The EU commended the commitment of voters in both states who came out to vote and asked that those enshrined with the mandate to see through a smooth democratic process should continue to act in all capacity.
“We commend the commitment and resilience of voters in both states who came out to exercise their democratic rights. We express our sympathy for those affected by the violence, including ordinary voters; INEC officials; members of the NYSC; civil society; and the media. All should be able to carry out their fundamental role in the democratic process free from intimidation and harassment,” the statement read.
