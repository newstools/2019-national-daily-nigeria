Kardashian West is doing everything she can to join her celeb hubby Kanye West in his new faith.
She has, for instance, promised to reduce the amount of flesh she bares in her dresses.
She also pointed out that she is growing older, and as such, the youthful vanity of sexualising every thing is fading out.
Kanye West recently protested  her 2019 Met Gala dress was “too sexy.”
The reality star explained to New York magazine in a November 2019 interview that she’s looking to a new phase of her life — one that doesn’t include thong bikinis.
“I am a mother of four. I am going to be 40 next year. When is it time to stop? She said.
The suggestion of her new image came to light since Kanye is embarking on a new spiritual awakening and Kim wants “to honour” her husband as he’s “going through this life change.”
She added, “I think I’m evolving to where I don’t feel the need to want to keep up.”
But Kardashian also admitted that yes, the process of her own awakening has already begun.
“I don’t know if it’s the fact that my husband has voiced that sometimes too sexy is just overkill and he’s not comfortable with that.
“I listen to him and understand him. Still, at the end of the day, he always gives me the freedom to be and do what I want,” she said.
“But I have kind of had this awakening myself. I realized I could not even scroll through Instagram in front of my kids without full nudity coming up on my feed pretty much all the time.
“And I definitely contributed to that. I mean, one of my most iconic covers was the Paper magazine one, when I was all oiled up and ripping my dress off.”
