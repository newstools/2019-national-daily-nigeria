President Godluck Jonathan might have saved the rod in the pickle for his godson and partyman Gov Seriake Dickson who supplanted him in the choice of the party flagbearer in the on-going Nov 16 guber election.
The results of the poll so far in Jonathan’s Ogbia LGA show some kind of rebellion against the ruling PDP and its candidate Duoye Diri whom Dickson anointed and empowered.
The opposition APC candidate David Lyon is leading so far—with a mile-wide margin.
