“I won’t have office of First Lady” – he created 1st lady office
“I will ban medical tourism” – he became the world famous medical tourist
“I will sell off all presidential jets” – Budget on presidential fleet even double
“I won’t pay oil subsidy because it’s scam” – Oil subsidy payment triple
“I won’t seek second term in office” – he did at last and forced himself on Nigerians
“I won’t seek for third term” – trust?
