It has been gathered by National Daily investigations that Arsenal chiefs have reportedly apportioned some blame to VAR for the Gunners’ dismal start to the season.
Arsenal chiefs
Unai Emery’s men are winless in the Premier League since October 6 and were well beaten by Leicester on Saturday as the Foxes ran out 2-0 winners at the King Power Stadium.
Arsenal will be at least eight points off the top-four place after Sunday’s fixtures and pressure is mounting on boss Emery with fans turning on the Spaniard.
It is understood the Emirates hierarchy are ready to keep faith in Emery and thought the display at Leicester showed ‘improvements’ despite a third top-flight defeat of the season.
National Daily learnt from reports by The Athletic that Arsenal chiefs accept that many of club’s problems have been self-inflicted – but also place some blame at the door of VAR.
Video Assisted Referee (VAR)
Sokratis had a late goal controversially ruled out against Crystal Palace a couple of weeks ago which would have given the Gunners a 3-2 win over their London rivals.
The technology again hit the headlines on Saturday after officials took almost four minutes to rule out David McGoldrick’s strike for Sheffield United in an eventual 1-1 draw at Tottenham.
Despite yet another defeat, Emery issued a defiant response when quizzed over his future after the game.
“We need time and patience. We have changed a lot of players and we have a lot of young players,” he told Sky Sports.
“We are going to achieve. We have had a lot of circumstances that haven’t helped but with consistency, we can do it.”
Asked if he will get the time from the board, Emery added: “The most important thing is to be calm but step up in our intensity and our work.”
