Former Super Eagles  goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama has announced that his playing days with the national team are finally over.
The former Lille of France disclosed this when he visited the camp of the Super Eagles of Nigeria after their hard earned win against the squirrels of Benin on Wednesday in Uyo in 2021 African Cup of Nations Qualifiers.
Enyeama, who met the players and technical crew, congratulated the Super Eagles on the win against Benin and charged them to go for another win against Lesotho in their next match.
“To be honest, my body language is no longer with the Eagles, infact I have been playing golf all along and I really admire it” Enyeama said.
Enyeama made his debut for the national team at the 2002 world cup against England and went on to record the joint highest  appearances for the National team (101).
He has enjoyed successful club football in Isreal with Maccabi Haifa, Lille of France, Enyimba of Aba among others.
He was also a member of the Nigerian national team from 2002 until October 2015, serving as its captain from 2013 until his retirement from international football. With 101 caps, he is Nigeria’s joint most capped player of all time.
