Senator Shehu Sani who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the 8th National Assembly, has ridiculed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo over the maneuverings in the Presidency in which the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, took flight from Abuja  to London, the United Kingdom to summit a bill to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.
Reports indicated that Kyari presented the amended Deep Offshore Act in London to President Buhari on Monday. The issue has been generating controversy in the country.
Senator Shehu Sani was gathered to have appealed to Nigerians to stop criticising the Vice President before they throw him into another trouble.
Sani on his Twitter handle wrote: “Make una leave Baba make him rest for London, una wahala dey too much. Abi una no get old papa for house? (leave Buhari to rest in London, your problem is too much Nigerians)
“As for him, person wey no complain, make una no complain for am before una land am in another soup, leave am make him Kuku de shaku. (As for his VP that is not complaining, leave him alone before you all put him in trouble. Leave him alone to ‘Shaku’).
Several other stakeholders in the polity had also condemned the President for undermining the Vice President while proceeding on his two weeks travel to the UK after his sojourn in Saudi Arabia.
