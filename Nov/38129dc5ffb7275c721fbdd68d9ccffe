The Trauma Care International Foundation (TCIF) is organizing the first ever trauma care conference in Nigeria on Nov. 19, and the gathering will be addressing the way forward in trauma care delivery in Nigeria.
According to the Foundation, trauma has become one of the leading sources of death globally, and it has equally assumed the status of a public health burden in Nigeria.
“It is our expectation that this event will present a platform for all relevant stakeholders to engage and proffer sustainable solutions to the problems surrounding trauma care and emergency response in Nigeria,’ said Deola Philips, the chairperson of the foundation, in a press release.”
The conference, the medical doctor added, will also provide a platform for the stakeholders to debate and stimulate inter-disciplinary discussions in the fields of trauma care and emergency response management.
Among the hundreds of stakeholders and professionals in the field of health that will grace the events include: Health Minister Osagie Ehanire, special guest of honour; Sen. Ibrahim Oloriegbe, Chairman Senate Committee on Health, keynote speaker; and Prince Julius Adewale Adelusi-Adeluyi, chairman Juli PLC and conference chairman.
The keynote speaker will address the topic Trauma Care: Way Forward while the panel of discussants will debate ‘Building Sustainable Trauma Care Systems in Nigeria (with emphasis on Low-Income Settings).
