National Daily reliably gathered that Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly decided he wants to sign Erling Braut Haaland.
Solskjaer has reportedly requested the signing of Erling Braut Haaland
The Norwegian striker has been a revelation at Red Bull Salzburg this season, scoring seven Champions League goals already this season amongst 26 goals in 18 games in all competitions.
Haaland’s form has put top European clubs on red-alert – and Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet says United are now ready to pull the trigger and make their move for the teenager.
Erling Braut Haaland has been the flavour of Europe this season
Solskjaer is said to have put around the message that he wants a reunion with his former Molde striker at Old Trafford, with a move likely to materialise next summer.
United are in the market for attacking reinforcements in January after the departures of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez in January.
Mario Mandzukic is said to be close to a move as a short-term solution, but Haaland could be a key signing in the long-term.
He is likely to remain at Salzburg until the end of the season having settled in Austria and with the club chasing several pieces of silverware.
But he has already been named a key target by Solskjaer, who has outlined what he believes his worth to be to club bosses to put the wheels in motion for negotiations to begin.
Haaland is also believed to recognise a full pre-season could give him the best opportunity to successfully adapt to the demands of the Premier League next season.
He recently outlined the impact of Solskjaer on his early career as he ponders a reunion with the man who handed him his senior debut.
Haaland partly owes his football development to Solskjaer
“He has had a huge impact on my life, both as a person and as a trainer,” Haaland told TV2.
“He won the Champions League and was an incredibly good player. He has taught me a lot.”
