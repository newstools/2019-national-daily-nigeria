The Katsina State chapter of the National Conscience Party (NCP) on Monday accused the All Progressive Congress (APC) of bribing tribunal judges to get judgement in favour of its candidates, saying the party has evidence to support its claims.
The NCP which stated this in a statement issued by the state chairman of the party, Abdulmumin Sani, in Katsina, also claimed that the APC offered $193,700 as bribe to members of the state Election Petition Tribunal to rule in favour of the state governor, Aminu Bello Masari.
He said: “The APC has been pretending to be fighting war against corruption at the state and at the federal levels but unfortunately it is now crystal clear to all well-meaning Nigerians that APC in Katsina State as a party is openly aiding and abetting corruption instead of fighting it.
“The latest among many examples of corrupt practices perpetrated by the Katsina State government under the leadership of Aminu Bello Masari is that of giving bribes and other inducements to members of the Katsina State governorship election petitions tribunal.
“It is now on record that Aminu Bello Masari and the APC in Katsina State gave the sum of $193,700 as bribes to one of the three judges that presided over the petition challenging the re-election of Aminu Bello Masari of the APC as Governor of Katsina State
“But unfortunately for them, but luckily for the people in Katsina State, the judge turned back the money and it’s now duly deposited for safe keeping with one of the security agencies.”
