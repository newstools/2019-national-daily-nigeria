Lagosians driving past the Lekki Express Toll Gate faced a tumultuous week following the suspension of electronic passage.
The Lekki Concession Company Limited informed its customers last week that it will be upgrading its tolling system by enhancing and modernizing service delivery at the Plazas. Thus all cars have been diverted to its cash tolls.
Due to the upgrades, it explained that electronic passages via the Toll Plazas and the online payment platforms “will be impacted from 9th – 15th November 2019″. The company claims it is migrating its customers’ toll accounts from the existing tolling system to a newly installed system.
The move has apparently restricted movement at the plaza meaning electronic customers with eTag or Swift Pass being unable to gain passage except they pay cash or exchange with a voucher.
The experience has been excruciating for motorists who now spend more time passing through the toll during peak hours in the morning and at night. Long queues of cars can be seen at either side of the toll during peak hours while the easy pass toll remains barred from entry.
National Daily gathered that the situation could remain beyond the November 15 timeline possibly extending till the end of the month. The Easy pass section could still be seen closed on Saturday, November 16th. LCCI is yet to confirm if there will be an extension to the timeline.
The upgrade also means customers who wish to top up on their cards or Swift Pass cannot do so online or in the offices until the upgrades are completed.
