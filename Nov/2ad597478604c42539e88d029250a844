Former Aviation Minister Femi Fani-Kayode has ridiculed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for allowing operatives of the Department of State Services, DSS, attached to him to brutalise a reporter.
According to him, allowing his security aides to beat-up a reporter was an act of cowardice by the Vice President.
In a tweet, Fani-Kayode wrote: “Someone tell @ProfOsinbajo that getting his security team to beat up @vanguardngrnews’s Abayomi Adeshida & smash his camera won’t make @MBuhari give him back his 35 sacked aides or restore his lost honor & glory. Hitting soft targets that cannot hit back is the cowards way!”
The Vanguard journalist, Mr Abayomi Adeshida, was beaten up by security details of the vice-president.
