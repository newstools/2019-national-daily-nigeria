While Governor Yahaya Bello and leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are still puzzling over potential uneasiness in the Kogi State after the governorship election which the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had declared war to retrieve the stolen mandate, the PDP is causing more palpable panic in the state when it declared its readiness to upturn the result of the inconclusive senatorial election in Kogi West on November 30 when the supplementary election holds.
The PDP on Sunday directed its members and supporters in Kogi West to brace up and get ready for a triumphant supplementary Kogi West Senatorial election on Saturday, November 30, insisting that nothing will deter the party from wining at the polls.
The party called on all its members, supporters, citizens and voters in Kogi West to unite in readiness against any repressive forces that may attempt to forcefully invade any polling unit, disrupt electoral process or alter results as witnessed in the November 16 elections.
The PDP in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary, cautioned that Kogi State and particularly, Kogi West, remains its home and the people are not ready to stomach the kind of impunity exhibited by the APC in the November 16 polls.
“Our party, therefore, charges the people of Kogi State to come prepared to vote, protect their votes and ensure that they stamp their will on the ballot despite the odds,” PDP declared.
The PDP cautioned security agents as well as officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to pander to repressive forces, who seek to subvert the will of the people, as such is capable of attracting dire consequences.
The party directed its members to stay united under their leaders in the area, as they would continue to be updated of vital information ahead of the election.
“The PDP is mourning our compatriots slain by the APC on November 16 and restates that their death will never be in vain,” the statement read in part.
