Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made known his intent on bringing Red Bull Salzburg star Erling Haaland to Manchester United to the satisfaction of the Red Devils supporters National Daily gathered
Solskjaer wants Haaland to boost his United attack
The Norwegian has been tracking his compatriot’s progress this season as he looks to bolster his forward options.
Haaland has scored a whopping 26 goals in 15 appearances this season
Haaland’s 26 goals have attracted the interest of Juventus and Real Madrid as well as United.
National Daily further learnt from the reports by Daily Mail that despite the Austrian side slapping a £75m price tag on their star man the Red Devils have not been put off with Ed Woodward making funds available.
It is understood that discussions have already been held at Carrington over how Haaland and current frontman Marcus Rashford could play together in United’s attack.
A January deal looks difficult with Salzburg reluctant to let Haaland go midseason – especially if they remain in European competition.
United though are confident they can secure the 19-year-old’s services in the summer.
Haaland enjoyed his senior debut with Molde under Solskjaer
Haaland previously worked with Solskjaer at Molde before he made the switch to Salzburg for just £4.5m.
