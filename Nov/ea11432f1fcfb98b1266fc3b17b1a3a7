Nigerian football fans were delighted to receive the news of Enyeama’s presence in the camp with some going as far as asking him to remain with the team.

Enyeama’s visit was received with cheers
The Super Eagles are preparing for their AFCON 2021 qualifier clash against Lesotho after beating Benin with a slim margin in their opening Group L encounter on Wednesday.
The team was put through a light training on Thursday at the Le Meriden Hotel in Akwa Ibom. However, it was not a normal training day as former Super Eagles captain was seen with the goalkeepers in camp.
The former Lille goalkeeper last played for the National team in 2015 but was in high spirits with other goalkeepers on Thursday.
It is yet to be known if Enyeama was just in town to pay the team a visit or he is training with the team to keep fit after being released by Lille.
Nevertheless, it’s good to see the 37-year-old back in the National team set up once again.
