Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation and a PDP chieftain, has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari over undermining the Office of the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, signing the amended Deep Offshore Act in London.
Fani-Kayode expressed perturbation over the increasing undermining of the VP, protesting if the loyalty of Osinbajo to Buhari is still desirable while being ‘sidelined’ in the Buhari administration. The statesman chided Buhari for not handing over to Osinbajo while not in the country.
Fani-Kayode on his twitter handle wrote: “How do you describe a VP that insists on remaining in office after his boss refuses to hand over power to him when he goes on leave and instead gets his Chief of Staff to fly over to London to sign legislative bills into law?
“If your boss can’t trust you, why are you still there?
Buhari had signed the Deep Offshore Act on Monday in London, noting that the amended Bill will generate at least $500 million additional revenue for the Nigerian government.
The Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, was with Buhari when the President assented to the bill in London.
Several stakeholders had protested Osinbajo should have signed the bill while the President was away in the UK. The stakeholders also chided President Buhari for not transmitting a letter to the National Assembly to empower the Vice President to function as acting president while he is away.
