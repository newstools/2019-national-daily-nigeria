The immediate past Governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun, has poured cold water on his purported 2023 presidential ambition by describing the poster that has gone viral on the internet on his bid to vie for the nation’s highest political office in four years’ time as a “mere distraction.”
Amosun, who now serves as a senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District, disowned a graphic poster that surfaced on social media, suggesting he is interested in becoming the president in 2023.
In a statement issued on Thursday by his media aide, Alhaji Bola Adeyemi, the former governor described the poster and anything of such publication as “nothing but a distraction.”
He said: “My attention has been drawn to a poster, suggesting I had thrown my hat into the 2023 presidential race.
“It definitely belies logic that such a move would be my preoccupation or in any way linked to me when indeed I have not spent a year in my current assignment as the Senator representing Ogun Central District.
“It goes without saying that anyone nursing a Presidential ambition at a time President Muhammadu Buhari has just begun to consolidate on the successes of his first term, is not only an enemy of the Nigerian State but clearly does not desire any good for Mr. President.
“As a Senator, my hands are full and I am committed to working with fellow patriots on how best to move our nation forward by supporting and working with President Buhari.
“There is a time for everything. The time to address 2023 is clearly not anywhere close.”
