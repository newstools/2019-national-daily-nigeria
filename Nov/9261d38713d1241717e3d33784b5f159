Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has accused the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), Adams Oshiomhole of being economic with the truth over the current situations of things at the ongoing construction at the Bayelsa Airport
The governor also clarified that only N70 billion was spent on the acquisition of land, clearing, sand filling and actual construction of the airport as opposed to the N100 billion claimed by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole.
Recall that on Thursday, Oshiomhole accused Dickson of wasting N100 billion on the airport which he said was flooded.
Oshiomhole who was speaking during a meeting with a former Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lokpobiri and some state governors, asked Governor Dickson to account for the money expended on the runway project which he said was the most expensive in the world.
Reacting, Dickson, while taking newsmen round the airport runway on Friday, denied insinuations that the newly constructed cargo airport in the state is flooded.
He said: “It is clear from this visit that former Gov. Adams Oshiomhole lied when he was quoted as having said that the airport runway is flooded.
“All the visitors confirmed that the 3.5 km. runway was high above flood level.
“So, the question is: why is a fellow South-South person deliberately maligning another governor from the region? Is this the way to play politics, even with the development of the people?
“This is the height of flood in Bayelsa state, but as you can see, there is no flood here; we reclaimed these parcels of land before starting the construction.
“This airport has one of the best runways in this country; so we will not join Oshiomhole in playing politics with the fortune of our people,” he said.
