The Court of Appeal sitting in Makurdi has dismissed an appeal filed by Senator George Akume challenging the victory of Barr Emmanuel Orkejev as the senator representing Benue North West.
The court dismissed the petition of the former governor and APC’s senatorial candidate, and upheld the election of Orkejev of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP.
The tribunal had earlier dismissed the petition filed by Akume challenging the election of Barr Okejev in the March 9 elections.
Akume then approached the Appeal Court challenging the judgement of the tribunal.
Chairman of the appeal panel, Justice I. G Mbaba, in a judgment read by Justice Louise Otis, J.C.A on Friday, upheld the judgment of the tribunal on grounds that the appellant’s Appeal lacks merit, the appellant was also not able to prove his case.
The court said all evidence were based on hearsay.
