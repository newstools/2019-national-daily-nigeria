Sen Dino Melaye got it hard this time as his latest drama at INEC headquarters in Abuja bombed on Wednesday.
Melaye in the company of some journalists was refused entry into the commissionâ€™s premises
The embattled senator had gone to INEC to submit more petitions.
He earlier submitted video clips to make his point that the Nov 16 senatorial election between him and Smart Adeyemi of the APC be cancelled.
Adeyemi led the inconclusive election with 20000 plus votes
A camera belonging to one of the Journalists was said to have been seized but later released when Melaye intervened.
