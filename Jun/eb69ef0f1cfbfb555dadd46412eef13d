The just concluded 2018/2019 Nigerian Professional Football  League organised by the League Management Company (LMC) has come and gone producing Enyimba FC as champions, National Daily monitored during the Super6.

A onerous feat was achieved in the season just gone by when Ifeanyi Ubah FC defensive King Charles Chukwudi Okafor became the third defender in Nigeria’s local footballing history since the new millennium to be nominated more than 7(Seven) times into the Premier league team of the week.

He joins only two defenders to attain such feats. They are Obinna Nwaneri of the People’s Elephant, Enyimba FC in 2002/2003 and Godfrey Oboabona of Sunshine Stars  in the 2012/2013 Season.

Achieving this footballing heroic feat is not easy for the talismanic defender who manned the defense of the Nnewi outfit making them to concede the lowest number of goals at home.

  Okafor  whose is likened to the ‘Rock of Gibraltar’ combined the defensive techniques of Christian Chukwu with that of Legendary Paolo Maldini and the last defender to win world best footballer, Fabio Canavaro.

His Foresight, man on man tackling, ball sense and confidence is a niche that has catapulted the former Zamfara United and Plateau United ace to limelight and this latest footballing fame.

No doubt, the Enugu born footballer has much to offer both in an attacking and defensive role.

The former Nigerian junior invitee will certainly be someone to reckon with in the future not just locally but globally in the round leather game.
