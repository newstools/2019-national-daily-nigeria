The Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal on Monday turned down the request of the Peoples Democratic (PDP) and the Presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, to be granted access to the server of the Independent National Electoral Commission.
National Daily learned that the five-man panel unanimously rejected the PDP and Atiku request, noting that issues have been joined by parties on the existence or otherwise of the server.
The judges insisted that the tribunal cannot delve into those issues at the interlocutory stage.
