Egyptian formerÂ  President Mohamed Morsi has died in court.

Egyptian state television reported this Monday.

Morsi was in office when the Arab Spring kicked off in 2013.

The mass protests brought down his regime as the Egyptian armed forces overthrew him in 2013.

He was thereafter sentenced to seven-year jail term for falsifying his candidacy application for the 2012 presidential race.
