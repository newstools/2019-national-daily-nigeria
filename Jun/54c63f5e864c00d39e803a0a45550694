The Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has advised the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu to shelve any ambition for the 2023 presidential race.

Speaking in Umuahia, Abia state on Friday, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the group, Chuks Ibegbu, warned that contesting for president in 2023 will only rubbish the political career of Tinubu.

He advised Tinubu to “shelve any ambition he is nursing for 2023 presidential election”, adding that “running a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), to assist poor Nigerians will be better”.

“This is the time for Tinubu and other Nigerians that made their wealth solely from Nigeria politics, to pay back to the society they milked directly and indirectly. I wonder why and how Tinubu could nurse such ambition, if it is true, when the South East and the third leg of Nigeria is yet occupy the position.

“I laud Tinubu’s courage and efforts to deepen the democratic space from the June 12 days, but it appears diminishing return is now setting in. I think it’s high time for him to help build an equitable and just Nigeria.

“He should be less controversial and less ambitious, so that, those who cherish his doggedness will not abandon him in the years ahead. Let him listen to the voices of wisdom from Yoruba land. You know our Yoruba brothers are known as arbiters of fairness and justice.”
