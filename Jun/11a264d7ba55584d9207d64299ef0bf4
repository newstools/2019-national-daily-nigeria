One of the sons of the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, late Chief MKO Abiola, Abdulmumuni, has lamented about the state of Nigeria since 1993.

Reacting to the adoption of June 12 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day by the Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, Abdulmumuni said the date should be a day of national sober reflection for Nigerians as things are worse than it was in 1993.

Recall that President Buhari on Monday signed into law the Public Holiday (Amendment) Bill, making June 12 a public holiday in the country and country’s official Democracy Day, replacing May 29.

Abdulmumuni who lamented that the education and health sectors had collapsed, however, expressed hope that things will get better but lamented about the increasing rate of poverty.

He said: “The recognition of June 12 as Democracy Day will get people thinking. I don’t think it should be a day of celebration.

“It should be a day of reflection of where we are as a country and where we are going. It is important that we should know that for the decisions we make today, there are consequences.

“This is because those who made the decisions to truncate the Nigerian people’s yearning for democracy in 1993 would now see that sometimes when you make certain decisions, you must see the consequences.

“The country is worse off than it was in 1993. My father was trying to address certain issues like poverty eradication and free education. But what is going on in the country now? The education system is dilapidated.

“The health care system is nothing. People are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer.
