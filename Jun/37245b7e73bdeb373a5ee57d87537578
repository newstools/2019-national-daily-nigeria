The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) has constituted committee on national security to provide solutions to the rising insecurity in the country. The security crisis in Nigeria appears to have gone out of the limit that the Federal Government of Nigeria can unilaterally handle, thus, the rising insecurity has gone beyond the capacity of the Nigerian Government, compelling the intervention of the state governments.
It was disclosed that the major deliberation at the inaugural meeting of the Nigeria Governors Forum after the 2019 general elections would be focused on national security.
It was indicated that the NGF at the National Economic Council meeting decided to constitute a committee on national security to look into the increasing incidence of insecurity.
The NEC meeting was said to be the first that Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State presided as new Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum since he was appointed through unanimously decision to lead the Forum.
Over 20 governors were said to be in attendance at the NEC meeting.
