Prospective private candidates of the 2019 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) – second series (Aug/Sept WAEC GCE) across Nigeria can now conveniently purchase their registration PINs through any of the multiple channels available on Remita, an electronic payment platform in Nigeria.
 This agreement was made recently as the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) formally announced the commencement of the sale of WAEC GCE registration PINs to commence on May 27 and end on July 19, 2019.
 Intending candidates are to visit the Remita website or mobile app and choose a preferred payment channel of the many options available which include debit/credit card, internet banking, mobile wallet (Pocket Moni, Paga, etc), branches of all Nigerian banks, and at designated agent locations in the country.
 Once payment is completed, the exam registration PIN is delivered to the candidate’s email and also displayed on the Remita payment receipt sent to the same email. The candidate is then expected to proceed to WAEC’s website to complete registration with the obtained PIN.
 “We are glad to always provide everyday payment solutions for our customers across the value chain. In this particular instance, it is our pleasure to empower prospective candidates of the August/September WAEC GCE with multiple payment options available round-the-clock that would help them complete their registration in good time, with no hassles,” said David Okeme, Divisional Head, Applications and Vertical Markets, of SystemSpecs, owners of Remita.
