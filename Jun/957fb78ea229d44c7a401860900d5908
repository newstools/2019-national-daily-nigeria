The Federal Government of Nigeria through the Police authorities has reacted to a circular recently issued by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, advising its citizens to stay of some states in Nigeria because of insecurity.

Recall that National Daily had on Tuesday reported a statement issued by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth office where it advised its citizens travelling to Nigeria to avoid states like Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Cross River States and 20km of the border with Niger in Zamfara State.

The UK government also warned against all but essential travel to: Bauchi, Zamfara, Kano, Kaduna, Jigawa, Katsina, Kogi and within 20km of the border with Niger in Sokoto and Kebbi States, non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa, and Rivers and Abia States.

According to the UK government, there’s a high threat of kidnap throughout the listed states, insisting that UK citizens working or travelling to the areas, especially in the north-east of Nigeria, you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping.

“If you travel to areas to which the FCO advise against travel, you are particularly at risk and will need a high level of security. If you’re working in northern Nigeria you should make sure your employers provide an adequate level of security where you live and where you work, make sure they regularly review security arrangements and familiarise yourself with those plans.”

But reacting in a statement issued by the Police spokesman, DCP Frank Mba, the police said while it acknowledge that Nigeria is not without some security challenges, just like other nations of the World, including the advanced democracies, it wish to restate that Nigeria remains one of the most beautiful places to live in the World.

“It is a safe country with its own peculiar socio-economic and security challenges. We therefore wish to reassure Nigerians and the International Community of their safety and the commitment of the Police and other security agencies to continue to provide effective security services to the nation.”
