A vehicle carrying over two dozen disposable gas canisters rammed into the US embassy in central Seoul Tuesday just days before US President Donald Trump’s scheduled visit, Seoul police said.
The 40-year-old driver, who has not been identified, was arrested on the scene, they said.
Police said the car was carrying 28 butane canisters when it ploughed into the embassy’s main gate, partially damaging it.
