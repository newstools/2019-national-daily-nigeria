The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) on Friday killed 42 members of the militant Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in a clearance operation on the Lake Chad Island; several other members of the militant group were said to have  escaped with gunshot wounds.
Col. Timothy Antigha, Chief of Military Public Information of the MNJTF, confirming the successful operation in a statement on Saturday, noted that this was the greatest loss suffered by the terrorists in the past six months.
National Daily learned that Antigha that narrated troops effectively suppressed ISWAP and successfully conducted the clearance operation.
“Unfortunately, the MNJTF lost a soldier while 10 others were wounded in action,” Antigha lamented.
The Chief of Military Public Information of the MNJTF also indicated that the terrorists lost equipment when two of their gun trucks and three motorcycles were destroyed; adding that troops recovered two light machine guns and two AK 47 riffles from the terror fighters.
National Daily further learned that Antigha had earlier in the week said that ISWAP also met a similar fate when they attempted to attack MNJTF troops in Sector 1 Foward Operation Base (FOB) in Ngouma in Cameroon.
The Multinational Task Force information manager also explained that in that engagement, ISWAP lost five terrorists, while one was captured. He added that 13 AK 47 riffles and two hand grenades were recovered from the encounter.
Antigha maintained that the MNJTF also conducted air interdiction in Arege and Malkorony where several terrorists were killed, noting that the headquarters and logistics base of a top ISWAP commander, Abu Talib, was targeted in that operation for destruction.
