National leader of the All Progressives congress (APC) is on a collision path with President Muhammadu Buhari over his decision to block the appointment of former governor of Lagos state, Akinwunmi Ambode as a minister representing Lagos state.

National Daily gathered that President Buhari may reward the former governor and appoint him as one of his next cabinet members.

But top APC chieftains in the state are against the appointment, claiming that Ambode frustrated some party members in the state during his tenure and needed to be taught a lesson.

Reacting to the development, the Save Lagos Group (SLG) called on Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to stop playing God over rumoured plan to appoint the immediate past Governor of the State, Akinwunmi Ambode into the yet-to-be-constituted cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari.

The group said it was reacting to a purported statement by the former Lagos governor that he (Tinubu) would resign his membership of the APC if President Buhari nominates Ambode as ministerial nominee from the State, Daily Post reports.

In a statement by the SLG’s Convener, Comrade Adeniyi Alimi Sulaiman on Tuesday, the group stated: “Tinubu has turned himself to Alpha and Omega of the State nay Nigeria politics, forgetting that only God gives and takes power and no human being can act like God.”

SLG maintained that “all the ideas of Tinubu in the political armament of the State and Nigeria was parochial and self-serving.

“Ambode is more qualified than Tinubu because Ambode is educationally qualified to hold any position including Minister in the country, because he doesn’t have ‘Chicagogate’ on his educational qualification like Mr. Godfatherism.”
