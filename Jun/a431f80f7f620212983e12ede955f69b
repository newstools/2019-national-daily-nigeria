Former Super Eagles captain and goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama revealed recently that  he is not ready to hung up his boot yet he will return to action with a club in France next season.

Enyeama, 36, failed to make a single league appearance for Lille in the 2017-18 season after falling out of favour with then head coach of the side, Marcelo Bielsa and was released on mutual consent at the the end of the campaign.

After failing to secure a move to another club last season, Enyeama is eager to return to action again ahead of the new campaign.

“After the club’s decision to terminate my contract, I stayed home and made the decision to rest. I still want to play, I still have the desire. I hope I will find a new project,” Enyeama added.

“I did not think about retiring at all, it’s not in my diary. I already have contacts for next season, I started talking with a club in France. I prefer playing.
