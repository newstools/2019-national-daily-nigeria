The heat is on for the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Kogi State. Governor Yahaya Bello has continued to come under intense pressure to secure the ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to seek re-election for second term in office.Some stakeholders in Kogi State say the governor is desperate for second, adding that the governor recorded monumental failure in the about past four years of his first tenure.
Governor Bello, National Daily gathered is deploying every paraphernalia in his political arsenal to get the support of the party leadership beginning with President Muhammadu Buhari to the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, for the party ticket.
Having made overtures to APC national chairman, Oshiomhole, and APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, without assurances of support, Governor Bello at the weekend mobilised traditional rulers in the 21 local government areas of Kogi State to subtly extend his campaign for the APC ticket to President Buhari.

However, the meeting was said not to have yielded the desired result. Details in subsequent reports.
