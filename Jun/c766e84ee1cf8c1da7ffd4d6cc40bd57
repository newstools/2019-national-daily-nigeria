Paul Ihuaku, 45, has been arrested by the Imo Command of the Civil Defence Corps for allegedly raping his mother.
IThe state Commandant of the NSCDC, Mr Raji Ibrahim, said the suspect was arrested by the operatives at Umueke Ezagbogu in the Ezinihitte Mbaise Local Government Area of Imo.
The mother reported the suspect to the youth in the area, who apprehended him and alerted men of the corps.
The suspect, who lives in the same house as his moher, confessed to the crime, adding that he was under the influence of alcohol.
“There was heavy rain and I could not resist the urge for sex; so, I had to use a local pistol to threaten my mother to submission and I later raped her,” Ihuaku stated.
Asked if he was married, the suspect said he did not have the means yet, as he was not doing anything tangible.
“I was not bewitched. I was under the influence of alcohol,” he added.
According to the mother, she saw him (Ihuaku) with a pistol which he used to threaten her.
“He told me that he would kill me. I could not do anything other than to beg him to drop the gun.
“It was in the process that he threw me on the ground and it (rape) happened.
“I had to call on the youth the next morning. The youth later went to the NSCDC headquarters in Itu to report him.”
The mother confessed that the incident was the second time.
