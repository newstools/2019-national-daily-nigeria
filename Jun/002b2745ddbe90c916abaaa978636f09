Former Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Lasisi Oluboyo, on Thursday lost the suit he filed at an Ondo State High Court, Akure, demanding his unpaid emoluments and pension arrears from the state government. The court struck out the suit in its judgment in the state capital.
National DailyÂ learned that the presiding judge, Justice Bode Adegbehingbe, in his judgement, declared that Oluboyo was not entitled to any pension since he was appointed contrary to the provision of the constitution that stated that you must be elected before you can benefit from the perquisite of office.
Justice Adegbehingbe had said that since the issue of pension falls within industrial relation between an employee and employer, the best court to approach is the National Industrial Court.
Oluboyo who succeeded Ali Olanusi as Deputy Governor after the impeachment of Olanusi by the Ondo State House of Assembly, was said not to have been paid the statutory pension over two years after he left the office with former Governor Olusegun Mimiko.
Oluboyo, therefore, through his counsel, Olumide Ogidan, approached the court to compel the Ondo State government to pay his gratuity and pension running into millions of Naira.
The former Deputy Governor had insisted that he will challenge the judgement of the high Court at the Court of Appeal; adding that he may also challenge the judgement at the National Industrial Court on the advised of his legal counsel.
