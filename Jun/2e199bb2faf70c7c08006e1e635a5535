President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday denied media reports of immediate ban of almajiris in the north, affirming that there is no immediate ban on the Almajiri system.
Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, in a statement in Abuja, cautioned against misrepresentation of the pronouncements of President Buhari on free and compulsory basic education for every child of primary and junior secondary school age in Nigeria, during his speech on Thursday at the inauguration of the National Economic Council (NEC).
The SSA noted that while the Buhari administration is committed to free and compulsory education as a long-term objective of bringing to an end, the phenomenon of out-of-school children, any necessary ban on Almajiri would follow due process and consultation with relevant authorities.

Shehu said the federal government wants a situation where every child of primary school age is in school rather than begging on the streets during school hours.
“Reports that there are plans for the massive arrest of parents are definitely out of place,” Garba declared; insisting that violating the right to free and compulsory primary school education as a requirement of the Nigerian constitution is punishable by law.
At the inauguration of NEC, President Buhari had stated that the country’s children have rights and must be given their due rights and protection under the law.
The President also said governors need to put in place structures like schools and educational materials for pupils; otherwise, they also, are complicit in violating the law of the land.
