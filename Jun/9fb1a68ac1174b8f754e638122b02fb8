Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state on Friday stated the position of state governors on the issue of creation of state and local government police.

Recall that the Presidential Panel on Reform of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police Force had on June 3, submitted its report to the president.

The panel recommended the establishment of state and local government police among others things.

Speaking with State House correspondents after an expanded Security Council meeting, presided by President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Kayode Fayemi said the NGF is yet to take a position on the issue of state police.

He said that each state has its own peculiar security challenge that needed a suitable policing arrangement. “There are governors and states where their experience does not necessarily lend itself to a more devolved policing arrangement to the states.

Fayemi noted that while some governors had disclosed their ability to support such state and local government police, others were still battling with the challenge of paying existing workers’ salaries.

“But there are also states where there are agitations for this and their own governors too have a view that will work better in such states. Of course, there are economic issues relating to that; do we have the capacity at the state level to fund state police?

He further disclosed that a comprehensive National Economic Council (NEC) meeting will be held to address the issue of security.

He said that there was a committee looking into the report of the panel on reform of SARS, adding that the issues would be discussed at the next NEC meeting.
