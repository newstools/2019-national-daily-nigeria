A prominent Civil Rights Advocacy group- HUMAN RIGHTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (HURIWA) has warned of the grave consequences of marginalizing a bulk of the Nigerian populations who profess Christianity as their religion in the scheme of leaderships of the Executive Arm of Government; Legislature and the Judiciary in the unfolding democratic dispensation marking the second and final tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. 

HURIWA warned that the plots to undermine national unity by ensuring that only Moslems head all the branches of the central government started when President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration instigated the kangaroo trial resulting in the removal of Justice Walter Onnoghen the only Christian to have held the position of Chief justice of Nigeria in 30 years over some phantomand substantially forged allegations. “This exclusion will mark the end of Religious harmony in Nigeria and may result in anarchy and doom unless political stakeholders take measures to stave off the building up of mutual distrusts”.
HURIWA in a statement issued by 7.30pm on June 9th 2019 from the venue of a high wired lobby for the selection of the next Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives in Abuja, the Rights group expressed consternation and apprehension that the exclusion of Christians from headship of any of the three constitutional arms of government at the center offends section 42 of the constitution which outlaws discrimination and also constitute a gross infringements of the constitutionally guaranteed provisions on the Federal Character Principles enshrined in the highest laws of Nigeria. HURIWA through the National Coordinator Comrade Emmanuel and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf has prayed President Muhammadu Buhari and all political stakeholders to save Nigeria frim slidding into a state of mass distrust because if one of the largest constituents of Nigeria being Christians are excluded from the headship of the three arms of government it may not portend well for national peace, unity, and inter religious harmony that are essential for sustenance of constitutional democracy.  HURIWA cited the relevant section of the Nigerian Constitution that speaks against the systematic exclusion of Christians in thr political schemes of leadership as is about to happen imminently.
