Reports indicated that ethnic violence hit Amhara and other parts of Ethiopia in recent years over reforms implemented by the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister was said to introduced reforms to end political repression by releasing political prisoners, removing bans on opposition political parties and overseeing the prosecution of officials accused of human rights abuses. He further restored diplomatic relations with Ethiopia’s former long-time adversary, Eritrea.
His reforms were said to have provoked powerful interests in the country’s military and ruling coalition who plotted to bring him down. He was said to have escaped death at different times from explosions at public events.
