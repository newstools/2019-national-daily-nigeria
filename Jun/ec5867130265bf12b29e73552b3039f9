The kidnappers operating around Ikire and other communities in Ibadan-Ife expressway have been arrested.
The Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 11, Mr Leye Oyebade, disclosed this at the ongoing Southwest security summit in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Zone 11 comprises Oyo, Osun and Ondo states.
Oyebade made the revelation while explaining that security agencies were not overwhelmed by the security challenges in the region.
He added that those who kidnapped Prof. Adegbehingbe of the Obafemi Awolowo University have also been arrested.
He said police decided against publicizing their successes on those arrests for security reasons.
He was responding to claims by the governors that police were overwhelmed by the level of insecurity in the country.

The Ikire segment of the Ibadan-Ife expressway has become notorious for kidnapping in the last few months thereby instilling fear in motorists and commuters.
The kidnap of Prof. Adegbehingbe also reinforced the fear thereby causing outrage over the level of insecurity in Southwest.
The outrage was partly responsible for the security summit.
While commending the governors for supporting police operations in their various states, Oyebade insisted that more support, especially in the area of vehicles and technology, will further enhance the ability of the force to offer a more effective policing.
