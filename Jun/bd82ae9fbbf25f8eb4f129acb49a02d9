Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State has reacted to report that a gorilla allegedly swallowed N6.8million in Kano Zoological Gardens.

Recall that a finance officer in the Kano state Zoological Gardens was on Friday quoted as saying that a gorilla “sneaked into their office” and carted away the money, before swallowing it.

The incident was said to have happened during the Sallah celebrations.

Umar Kobo, the Managing Director of the zoo, confirmed that the money is missing and that the issue is being investigated.

“The issue is under investigations for now and I don’t want to say anything on the matter, many journalists have come to meet me but I don’t want to talk anything.

“What I can confirm is that money is missing,” Kobo said.

Abdullahi Haruna, the Police spokesman in Kano, was quoted as confirming that 10 persons, including those on duty when the money went missing, have been arrested.

“Yes, it is true that money from five days of Sallah festivities is missing from the Kano zoo,” he reportedly said, adding: “As at now, we have arrested 10 members of staff of the zoo including the security man and those working in the finance unit.”

But reacting, Ganduje ordered the State Anti-Corruption Commission to probe the missing
N6.8m.

The order was given in a statement issued by Abba Anwar, Chief Press Secretary to Gov Ganduje.

The statement added that Ganduje also asked the Commission to look into the immediate and remote cause of the allegation, directing them to unearth everything surrounding the incident.
