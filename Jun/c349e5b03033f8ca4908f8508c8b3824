Perhaps, it’s one very story thats indeed shocking. How do you explain that a player relegated to PSG bench is set to become the 2nd most important player in Juventus? Strange or not, Adrien Rabiot is set to join Juventus after being frozen out at Paris Saint-Germain.
The France international will reportedly become Juve’s second most paid star – Rabiot’s current contract at Parc Des Princes is set to expire at the end of June Adrien Rabiot’s proposed move to Juventus would make him the second highest earner in Serie A after Cristiano Ronaldo. The Paris Saint-Germain star was frozen out of the squad after he refused to extend his contract with the French champions. But the 24-year-old will be pocketing a massive pay package if he moves to Turin next season when his contract expires at the end of June.
According to beIN Sports’ Tancredi Palmeri, the Frenchman will be the second best-paid player in the league thanks to his €9million salary. But he will fall behind Ronaldo, who earns a mouth-watering €31m since arriving at the Allianz Stadium from Real Madrid last season.
Behind the PSG midfielder is Juve’s on loan Chelsea striker Gonzalo Higuaín, who pockets €8.5m and Paulo Dybala in fourth earning €7m. Palmeri was also quick to point out that eight of the top ten earners in the Italian league will play for Juventus next season, including welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey.
Below are the top ten earners in Serie A
1. Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus): €31m
2. Adrien Rabiot (TBC/Juventus): €9m
3. Gonzalo Higuaín (Juventus): €8.5m
4. Paulo Dybala (Juventus): €7m
5. Aaron Ramsey (Juventus): €6.9m
