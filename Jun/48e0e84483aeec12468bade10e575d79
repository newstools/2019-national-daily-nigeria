Deploys additional 1,000 troops to Middle East





The United States is not refraining from tis determination to exterminate Iran, a dreaded country in the Middle East since the crisis over the development of nuclear capability by the Arab country.
The US President, Donald Trump, has at different times threatened that the US at the height of provocation will destroy Iran on the outbreak of war with the Arab country. About one year ago, the US led aerial bombardment of a location in the heart of Iran under the guise of destroying the country’s nuclear site.
Since then tension has continued to build up in the Middle East over the refusal of Iranian leader to back down on the building of nuclear capability.
National Dailylearned that the US military is deploying additional 1,000 troops to reinforce the earlier troops mobilized to the Middle East, thus, intensifying the tension in America’s relations with Iran.
It was gathered that the US Acting Defence Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, explained that the deployment of the 1,000 troops was in response to what he described as “hostile behaviour” by Iranian forces.
The US Navy also shared new images it says links Iran to recent oil tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman.
Iran may have set the country in the frontier of renewed hostility from the US when the leader announced on Monday that it would no longer comply with part of the 2015 deal on curbing its nuclear ambitions.
Iran authorities had said that the country would breach a limit agreed with international powers on its enriched uranium stockpiles by June 27, 2019.
The US renewed provocation has, therefore, become visible in the outcome of the breach of international agreement Iran entered previously with the international community.
