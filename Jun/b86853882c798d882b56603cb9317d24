Christian Samuel’s 67th minute strike proved enough for Gateway United to pip Nnewi United 1 nil, and thereby earn crucial three points at Rojenny Int’l stadium in Nnewi, National Daily learnt.

In its fight for survival as well as keeping alive the hope of super 8 qualification, the Akeem Busari tutored side left nothing to chance by taking control of the game from the blast of the whistle.

The first attempt of the game fell to Seyi Okeowo who skillfully dribbled past his marker from the left flank but his cross posed no threat to the Nnewi goalkeeper.

As the home team continued to absorb the pressure, it was right wingback Julius Ikechukwu who put Nnewi goalie to test with a thunderous shot from the edge of the box.

Bearing in mind the need for nothing but a victory, the visitors resumed the second half strongly while the host became more aggressive in a bid to quell the attack, resultantly, a few number of free kicks were awarded but still not enough to break the deadlock.

15 minutes into the second half, Stephen Adodo received a pass from few yards outside the box but could only blast the ball over the bar.

Almost instantly, Nnewi responded and it was Nwafor Nonso who created a moment of scare with a left footed shot which slightly missed the target.

Eventually, Gateway United’s enterprise upfront did materialise as Seyi Okeowo laid a pass for onrushing Christian Samuel who without no hesitation fired the ball into the net.

The home team went in search of a leveller with long balls into the box but Gateway’s three man defence was able to keep them at bay even as the game went far beyond the 5 minutes added time.

With this result, Gateway United FC who have moved from the bottom  to third on the log with 8 points are next in action against table topper Dynamite FC with 11 points in Abeokuta on Saturday 29th June, 2019.
