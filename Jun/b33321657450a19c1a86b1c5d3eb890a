The Supreme Court has fixed judgment for July 5, 2019 in the appeals filed by Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the last governorship election in Osun.
A seven-man panel of the court chose the date after taking final arguments regarding the main appeal, marked: SC/553/2019 filed by Adeleke.
Adeleke is challenging the May 9, 2019 judgment of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, that upheld the APC candidate Adegboyega Oyetola as the governor of Osun State.
The Court of Appeal also set aside the majority judgment of the election tribunal which had allowed Adeleke’s petition and declared him winner of the election.
On Monday, by agreement of lawyers in the appeals, the court took submissions from Onyechi Ikpeazu (SAN) for the appellants and Wole Olanipekun (SAN) for the 1st respondent (Oyetola) in respect of appeal marked: SC/553/2019.
The court ruled its judgment in the main appeal will be applied to two others filed by Adeleke against the Court of Appeal’s decision in relation to the appeals filed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the APC.
he panel headed by Ag CJN Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad comprises Justices Olabode Rhodes-Vivour, Kumai Aka’ahs, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, Amiru Sanusi, Paul Galunmje and Uwani Abbah-Aji
