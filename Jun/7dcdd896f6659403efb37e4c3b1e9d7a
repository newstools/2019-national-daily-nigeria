Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, has alleged that ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo was one of the architects of the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election.

Kingibe, who was the running mate of late MKO Abiola under the platform of the defunct Social Democratic Party, SDP, spoke while appearing on Nigerian Television Authority, NTA.

He stated that though, Obasanjo attempted to convene a meeting of statesmen to address the aftermath of the June 12 crisis, President Muhammadu Buhari only attended the inaugural meeting and stopped because of the direction of the session.

Kingibe said: “In the aftermath of the annulment, one of the architects of the annulment, former President Olusegun Obasanjo tried to get some elder statesmen (former presidents and so on); I think at the African Leadership Forum to see how the aftermath of the annulment could be addressed or to see how the problems arising from the annulment could be addressed.

“And I think President Muhammadu Buhari did attend the meeting once, the inaugural meeting. I understood that when he (Buhari) saw the direction of the meeting, he decided not to attend again.

“Every time the issue of the annulment came up over the years, his position was very clear; he was very firm that the election was free, fair and there was a clear winner. And that the annulment was unjustified.

“So, having had the opportunity, perhaps, to right the wrong, I won’t be surprised he did so because it is in his character to try and do justice, however, belated and under whatever circumstances.”
