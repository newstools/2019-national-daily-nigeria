Nigeria’s Senate President, Ahmed Lawan has subtly began campaign for power to shift to the Southwest comes 2023 when President Muhammadu Buhari would have completed his second term in office.
Speaking in Yola, the capital of Adamawa state on Tuesday, Lawan said returning power to the Southwest will be the best that can be bestowed on the late Nigeria’s symbol of democracy, Chief MKO Abiola.
He, therefore, advised President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress to take a step further by handing over the 2023 presidential ticket to the South-west.
He added, “I have said it before and I believe that 2023 presidential ticket of the APC must go to the South-west. Since I made this comment last time, some members of my party have been hatching a plot to suspend me from the party but I am not moved and I will still hold my ground that power must go to the west.
“June 12 Democracy Day is a milestone in Nigeria’s history and anyone who embraces democracy in Nigeria should be proud of what Buhari has done and it takes so much courage to do.
“So many Nigerian leaders have shied away from talking or acting about it because of the controversy arising from the date and fear of being scandalized but this is what Nigerians want, respect, rule of law and honour for those who fought and bled for democracy and that is what Nigerians should remember as significant for this date.
“It was not marked to spite or contradict anyone but to celebrate the common value we share in the belief in democracy as the best form of government that would serve this country and its people. And Buhari must be praised for this day,” he told Sahara Reporters.
On whether the day is widely acceptable, he said, “I don’t think Nigerians rejected it in any way, on the contrary, it has been welcomed with huge applause across party and regional divides.”
