A Gudu Grade I Area Court in Abuja has ordered a divorce-seeking housewife, Amina Abdulsalam to pay her estranged husband, Sani Abdulraman, N20,000 as a condition for divorce.
The petitioner, who filed a case against Abdulrahman, told the court that she could no longer tolerate her husband of 13 years and wished to divorce him.
The Judge, Ado Muktar, said that as stipulated by Islamic law, when the divorce is at the insistence of the one of the couple, which in this case, was instituted by the wife, the court had a duty to grant them what they asked for.
“I hereby, pronounce the dissolution of the marriage between Sani and Amina as stipulated by Islamic law.
“However, your husband cannot take you back until after a new marriage has taken place between you and someone else,” he said.

She also informed the court that the respondent restricted her from seeing them when he took them back to school.

He told the court he was not interested in the money but requested that the court should order her to return the household items she took from his home when she left.
The couple, who got married in 2016 have two children.
