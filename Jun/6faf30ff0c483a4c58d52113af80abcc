The Management of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has called on the attention of Federal Public Institutions on the need for strict compliance with the Framework and Guidelines for the use of Social Media Platforms for Public Institutions, signed into law on 25th January, 2019.‎
The Framework and Guidelines was issued with the aim of providing guidance on the use of Social Media within the Public Institutions’ communications environment in order to improve government transparency, participation and interaction with the general public.
Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, Director General/CEO, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) disclosed this in a statement released on Thursday, in Abuja.‎
According to Pantami, “this call has become necessary as the Agency’s compliance monitoring activity revealed that some Public Officials use personal accounts for official communication.
“We further note that where official accounts are used, some Public Officials, upon expiration of their tenure or retirement, fail to release such accounts.
“These actions are in violation of the provisions of the Framework and Guidelines which requires Public Officials not to use personal Social Media accounts for official engagements and also to establish appropriate account handover processes including the need for change of password(s)upon leaving office.
“It should be noted that all official Social Media accounts of Public Officials in their official capacity are the property of Government and must be handed over appropriately.
“The Agency therefore advises Public Officials to take appropriate measures at ensuring that they comply with all the provisions of the Regulation within 14 days of this release to avoid being sanctioned.
“Public Institutions and the general public are further advised to acquaint themselves with NITDA’s Regulatory Instruments, available on the Agency’s website – www.nitda.gov.ng.‎
“It should be noted that violation of the Regulatory Instruments of NITDA is a criminal offence, which is punishable with a fine, imprisonment or both” the statement added.
