A young man claiming to be Ned Nwoko’s son (unverified) has called out Shan George, whom he claimed asked him of his father’s phone number, despite berating the politician.

The man known as Emzy on Instagram wrote that the actress once hit his DM to request for Ned Nwoko’s contact and he took to his Instagram to leak chats he had with the actress.

He wrote:

“Wow it just came to my notice.. Shan Gorge called my dad a dirty and ugly disgusting man but she keep disturbing me for his phone number what a a life.. my dad don’t do old school…

“Sorry to disrespect you ma but family first.  i know so many nollywood actress who wish to be in regina’s position.. instagram save this one here before she unsends them”

Here are the screenshots of the chat:
