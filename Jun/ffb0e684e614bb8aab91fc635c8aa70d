It was a sad occurrence when Islamist fighters were said on Thursday to have overrun an Army base in northeast, Nigeria, killing the commander. 
It was narrated that the Militants on Wednesday invaded an army base at Kareto village in northeastern Borno State, some 130 kilometers from Maiduguri. 
Report indicated that no other details about possible further casualties were available.
The Nigerian Army spokesperson was said not to have responded to the report yet.
It was noted that the latest development was at odds with the Nigerian military’s public statements that their campaigns against Boko Haram and Islamic State’s West African branch are making “major breakthroughs”; the Nigerian authorities have often described the terrorists as “remnants”, “degraded”. 
Reports indicated that the insurgents had overrun troops from the Nigeria Army’s 158th Battalion stationed at Kareto, killing at least their commanding officer and causing the remaining soldiers to flee. 
After the assault, the militants left Kareto but remained in the area, report further indicated.
