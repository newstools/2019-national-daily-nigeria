A gas pipeline has exploded at Kom Kom in Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers state, and dozens of residents that rushed to the scene were feared killed.
The incident happened on Saturday as workers of Shell Petroleum Development Company were carrying out routine maintenance.
Authorities said majority of the casualties are burnt beyond recognition in the fire that occurred early Saturday.
According to the spokesman of the Rivers State Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni, the casualty figure was yet to be ascertained but the fire has been put out.
“Shell was carrying out maintenance on the pipeline when the explosion happened. Our findings indicate that some members of the community rushed to the scene to scoop the product when the explosion happened.
“I can’t tell you how many people were burnt but it was not a good site. Our men are still at the scene,” he said.
