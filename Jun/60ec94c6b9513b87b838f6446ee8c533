”The commitment and love that I have for my country will never change until I stop playing,” Obi said.
”Right now it will be difficult to find young players who will be able to do that for the national team because the agents make money from the clubs.”
He will be hoping to lead the Super Eagles to their maiden AFCON title since 2013.
Nigeria is in Group B along with Guinea, Madagascar and Burundi.
