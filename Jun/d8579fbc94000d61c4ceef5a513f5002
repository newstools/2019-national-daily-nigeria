Two-time Federation Cup Champions Akwa United on Sunday evening touched down at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, on board Dana Airlines for the Nigeria Professional Football League NPFL season ending Super-six play-offs scheduled for Agege stadium from Tuesday 4th to Wednesday 14th June, 2019.
National Daily learnt that a delegation of 26 players and officials of the club landed at exactly 7:30pm following a smooth and safe flight from Port Harcourt Airport to the Centre of Excellence.
The Promise Keepers booked their place in the play-offs after finishing top of NPFL Group B log with 38 points from 22 games and will be playing against five other teams – Kano Pillars, FC Ifeanyi Ubah, Enugu Rangers, Lobi Stars and Enyimba International in their quest for a maiden NPFL title.
The Uyo based side will have their first and only training session at the Agege stadium on Monday ahead of their first match against Kano Pillars on Tuesday afternoon.
League highest goal scorer Mfon Udoh will be aiming to continue his goalscoring form for the Promise Keepers during the ten day playoff. The 26 man team for the play-offs includes three goalkeepers, ten defenders, seven midfielders and six forwards.
Dana Airlines – the official partners of Akwa United FC – signed a flight partnership extension deal late last year to airlift the Promise Keepers to and from away games this season in all competitions.
