Manchester United have settled on a replacement for David De Gea – but it reportedly isn’t Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Jan Oblak. De Gea, 28, is understood to be on the radar of Ligue 1 giants PSG, while Serie A titans Juventus have also emerged as potential suitors. Many United fans would like Oblak, who has established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in world football. But the Daily Mail claim that, if De Gea goes, United want Lille’s Mike Maignan.
Also Stoke is signings. A flurry of transfer activity at Stoke saw five new signings announced by the Championship side today. The Potters, under boss Nathan Jones, confirmed the acquisitions of a quintet of players – including former Manchester United youngster Nick Powell. Powell moves to Stoke after his deal with Wigan expired and is joined by fellow free transfer signings Lee Gregory, Adam Davies and Jordan Cousins. Stoke also confirmed the £2million signing of centre-back Liam Lindsay from Barnsley as Jones looks to build a squad that can challenge for promotion. Davies, a Wales international, was also signed from the Tykes while Gregory comes in from Millwall and Cousins agreed terms after leaving QPR.
