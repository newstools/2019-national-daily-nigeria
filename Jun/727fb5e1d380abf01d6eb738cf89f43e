At the sitting on Friday, the Appellant’s Counsel, Mr Abubakar Suleiman, moved an application to amend the originating summons which was opposed by the Respondent’s Counsel, Mr Afraimu Jingi.
The counsel argued on the legality to effect changes on the summons after expiration of the stipulated period in accordance with pre-election matters regulation and Court rules.
The Presiding Judge, Justice Ahmed Belgore, adjourned the case until June 23, to hear the main appeal and gave Respondent Counsel five days for reply on motion papers served on him on the amended prayers.
