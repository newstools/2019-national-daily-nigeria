The Nigerian Army in conjunction with the Borno State Government and the Kalthun Foundation made a major breakthrough in securing the freedom of a female National Youth Service Corps member in Borno State, Halima Umar, who was kidnapped in January by Boko Haram terrorists.
National Daily learned that the Youth Corps member, Halima Umar, from Gwoza, was set free after a jointly coordinated negotiation undertaken by the Borno State Government, the Kalthum Foundation, and a prominent journalist who liaises with the Boko Haram terrorists.
The Corps member, Halima Umar, was said to be received by the Borno State Deputy Governor, Umar Kadafur, at the Government House, Maiduguri, from the General Officer Commanding 7 Division, Brigadier-General Abdulmalik Biu, in the company of other officials.
The Borno State Government deputy governor was said to have remarked that the successful release of Halima is part of the new strategy the state government is adopting to collaborate with strategic partners and other interventionist agencies, to open lines of communication with the terrorists towards mitigating the process of securing the freedom of several non-combatant victims in Boko Haram captivity.
