The PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar has voiced his concern about a plot to arrest him.
The EU election monitors recently released  statement in which the mission denied knowledge of any server INEC used in the Feb 23 presidential election.
Atiku and his party have however been insisting there was a server manipulated to rig him out, and declared APC candidate and President Muhammadu Buhari winner.
Paul Ibe, Atiku’s media aide, said due to his boss insistence on existence of a server used by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), his enemies attributed a false comment on “mass protest” to him to prepare ground from his incarceration.
The fear in the Atiku camp is how the federal government might make an excuse of that protest to arrest him for inciting the masses when the case is already in court.
“I wish to emphatically state that such a statement did not emanate from Atiku Abubakar or his privies,” said Ibe in a press statement on Sunday.
“It is the work of mischief makers who want to mar his spotless pro-democratic record and lay the ground work for their threatened actions against him on false charges of being a threat to national security.”
Ibe said Atiku believes in the rule of law and in the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and he has never taken action or spoken words against democracy and will not start now.
“Atiku Abubakar and his team have confidence in God and thus call on those bent on mischief to have the fear of God and retrace their steps, he added.
He pointed at the culture of fear being created now to rein in Nigeria’s democracy.
But he noted that Nigeria and Nigerians have a consistent history of outlasting tyranny.
