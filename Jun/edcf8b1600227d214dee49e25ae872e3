Hours to the expiration of the 48 hours the Kano government gave  Emir Muhmmadu Sanusi II, the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum Kayode Fayemi  and businessman Aliko Dangte waded in , and finally settled the rift between Gov Abdullahi Ganduje and the emir.
A statement by Ganduje’s aide said Fayemi and Dangote had a conciliatory meeting with the two in Abuja on Friday.
After the meeting, Ganduje and Sanusi greeted each other in a show of reconciliation.
The National Daily reported earlier that Sanusi was accused by the state anti-graft agency of mismanaging N3.4bn between 2014 and 2017, and an investigative panel had recommended his suspension.
The Abuja meeting, however, ended the hostilities which started when Ganduje and his godfather Sen. Rabiu Kwakwanso parted ways in 2017. Sanusi, who was helped on to the throne in 2014 by Kwakwanso , a governor then,  had to side with his benefactor.
And a  loose cannon that many say he is, Sanusi started criticising Ganduje’s policies and those of the APC federal government. The emir actually supported the PDP in the March guber election.
The loss of the opposition candidate worsened the situation for Sanusi, and Ganduje was about to crush him with the corruption allegation as early as possible in his second tenure as governor.
So the reconciliation became inevitable–because Sanusi is apparently fatherless now, politically. Kwakwanso lost his presidential bid, and he could not return to the Senate either, thus edged out of power and influence for the next four years .
Now the emir’s Hobson;s choice is to abandon Kwakwanso in order to secure his throne.
He has congratulated  Ganduje for the victory in his second term in office.
‘He also wished”the governor successful tenure in office,” said Ganduje media aide.
“For healthier relationship between the two institutions of government and Kano Emirate Council, the dialogues will continue,” Sanusi was quoted s saying.
