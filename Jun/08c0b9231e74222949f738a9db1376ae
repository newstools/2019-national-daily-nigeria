A gorilla has been accused of swallowing N6.8 million in the Kano Zoological Gardens.
A finance officer in the zoo, according to BBC Pidgin, the gorilla “sneaked into their office” and carted away the money, before swallowing it.
This is the second incident in which a beast has been alleged to have swallowed cash in government agencies.
Last years, an employee of JAMB also claimed a python guzzled down some millions of naira at the exam board ofice in Benue.
The Kano incident was said to have happened during the Sallah celebrations.
Umar Kobo, the managing director of the zoo, confirmed that the money is missing and that the issue is being investigated.
“The issue is under investigations for now and I don’t want to say anything on the matter, many journalists have come to meet me but I don’t want to talk anything.
“What I can confirm is that money is missing,” Kobo said.
Abdullahi Haruna, the Police spokesman in Kano, was quoted as confirming that 10 persons, including those on duty when the money went missing, have been arrested.
“Yes, it is true that money from five days of Sallah festivities is missing from the Kano zoo,” he reportedly said, adding: “As at now, we have arrested 10 members of staff of the zoo including the security man and those working in the finance unit.”
