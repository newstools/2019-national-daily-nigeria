A Judge, Rita Ofili Ajumogobia, has lost her status as a judicial officer in the Nigerian judiciary. National Daily learned that this was confirmed by Justice Rilwan Aikawa of the Federal High Court, Lagos, on Friday, who in a judgement declared that Ofili Ajumogobia is no more a judicial officer in the Nigerian judiciary and so can be prosecuted in a court of law on any offence.
The former judge has been facing prosecution by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in conjunction with Godwin Obla on conspiracy and money laundering allegations.
The deposed Judged had argued that the charges were incompetent and that the court lacks jurisdiction.
Justice Aikawa dismissed her application, insisting that the presidents’ letter to the CJN in 2018 is clear, that she has ceased to be a judge.
