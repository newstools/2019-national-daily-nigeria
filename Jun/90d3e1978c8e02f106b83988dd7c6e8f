The Lagos Environmental Protection Agency, Lagos State, has indicated readiness to begin monitoring indiscriminate disposal of wastes in the state. The state government has noted that it is not unmindful of environmental pollution, which in recent times has become a major source of health concern across the world.
Accordingly, the General Manager of the Lagos Environmental Protection Agency at a forum in Lagos which had in attendance experts in E-Waste management sector, disclosed that the agency will begin a monitoring exercise in the state to ensure that only eco-friendly refrigerants are used by technicians in the state.
Also, a non- governmental organisation in Lagos demanded the Lagos State government to adopt better Environment friendly policies that would address the crises of noise and air pollution in the state.
They were of the belief that the environment will be healthier and safer when noise and air pollution are contained.
