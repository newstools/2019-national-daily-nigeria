The return of the Ebola epidemic has recorded over 2,000 victims in the country. The federal government was, however, said to be working hard in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to contain the spread of the disease and minimize its casualties.
National Dailylearned that about 2,000 Ebola cases have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, while the country was identified to be struggling with the second largest outbreak of the disease in history.
Health officials in the DRC acknowledged that have recorded 1,994 cases of the disease and 1,900 cases have been confirmed to be Ebola.
It was highlighted that 1,245 persons were confirmed to have died, with another 94 deaths were reported.
The outbreak, which began last August was said to have proved difficult to bring under control because of community mistrust and violent attacks on health care workers.
National DailyÂ had earlier reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) in May raised alarm over sporadic violence by armed militias who attacked treatment centres, which constrained health care resources.
