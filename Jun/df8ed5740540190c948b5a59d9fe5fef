“The suspect confessed that prior to his arrest, he has beheaded four children and gave their heads to his master who is now at large.
“According to him, he is paid N170,000 for every male victim and N160,000 for every female victim.
“He said his victims were taken from Sheda, Kwali, Kilankwa, Gwako and Leleyi villages.”

“I walked back to my area with a substance he gave to me. He told me that if I touch any child with it, he will not make sound.
