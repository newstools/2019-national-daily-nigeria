The European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) in Nigeria on Saturday said that it knew nothing about the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) server that was allegedly used to transmit results of the 2019 general elections.
While briefing newsmen in Abuja on the EU EOM’s report, the Deputy Chief Observer for the EU, Hannah Roberts said the Mission relied on results that were released by INEC.
She, said the EU Mission in Nigeria was unaware of an INEC server by which results were transmitted during the election.
“The EU had to rely on INEC’s explanation in result transmission,” she said..
The PDP and its presidential candidate have insisted at the election tribunal  the INEC server was manipulated by the commission to favour the APC and its presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari in the February 23 election.
But the election management body said it has no server—despite documents Atiku presented before the tribunal as evidence.
