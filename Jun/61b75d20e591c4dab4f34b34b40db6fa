A rape lawsuit against Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo in the U.S. that made headlines last year and sent the club’s shares down 15% has been quietly dropped, National Daily learnt.
A notice of voluntary dismissal was filed last month in Nevada state court in Las Vegas. The filing didn’t say whether the accuser had reached a settlement with the Portuguese soccer player.
The New York Times reported in March that Juventus, the Italian league champions, wouldn’t participate in the International Champions Cup in the U.S. this summer to avoid the risk that Ronaldo would be detained by authorities as part of a rape investigation.
Ronaldo publicly denied the allegations and never filed a response to the lawsuit.
Katheryn Mayorga filed a complaint Sept. 27, alleging that she was sexually assaulted by Ronaldo in 2009 in his penthouse suite at a Las Vegas hotel. Mayorga said in the complaint that while she agreed to a settlement with Ronaldo after the alleged assault, she was experiencing severe emotional trauma at the time and wasn’t competent to participate in the mediation.
Leslie Stovall, a lawyer for Mayorga, and Peter Christiansen, a lawyer for Ronaldo, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the dismissal.
