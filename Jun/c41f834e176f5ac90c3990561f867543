Real Madrid’s ready to sell star to Manchester United to fund Kylian Mbappe transfer
Real Madrid are reportedly ready to sell Gareth Bale to Manchester United in order to fund a move for Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe.

This latest update on Bale’s future comes from Spanish outlet Don Balon, which suggests Real are eager to swoop for Mbappe in what would no doubt be a dream move to strengthen their attack for the post-Cristiano Ronaldo era.

In a potentially complicated transfer merry-go-round this summer, Madrid may also need to get Bale off their books to fund any bid for Mbappe.

The France international would certainly be a big upgrade on the out-of-favour Welsh winger, who could, however, perhaps still do a job in the Premier League where he previously displayed the best form of his career in a spell at Tottenham.

The Catalonia-based newspaper Sport has revealed that, with Antoine Griezmann’s prospects of joining Barcelona fading, Paris Saint-Germain are now in pole position to sign the forward, who has announced he is to leave Atlético Madrid.

Such a deal would come with one major potential knock-on effect: it could well push Kylian Mbappé closer to a summer move to Real Madrid.
