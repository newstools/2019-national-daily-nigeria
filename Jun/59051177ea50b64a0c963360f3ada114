Unlike the May 29 inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, former head of State, retired General Yakubu Gowon, was absent at the June 12 Democracy Day anniversary held in Abuja at the instance of President Buhari. Gowon had, perhaps, joined other former presidents and heads of state of the Nigerian government in boycotting national activities organized by the President Buhari. By protocol, all former presidents and heads of state should get official invitation to such national event from the presidency, which National Daily learned was sent out.

Apparently, the former presidents and heads of state who include Dr. Olusegun Obasanjo, retired General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, retired General Abdusalami Abubakar, including the head of the Interim National Government (ING), Chief Ernest Shonekan, were all absent at the Wednesday June 12 anniver4sary at eth Eagles Square, Abuja.
