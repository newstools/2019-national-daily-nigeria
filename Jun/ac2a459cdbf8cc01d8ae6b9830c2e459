Chairman of the League Management Company Shehu Dikko speaking on the recent incident on the field during the NPFL playoff at the match between Rangers International and Kano Pillars that  the time for violence in the NPFL  is long gone and will not be condoned.

Dikko told National Daily that the incident  was a  spontaneous one stemming from the action of one of the players which instigated the fans but added that has been dealt with.

He further said, “we have passed the era of having the stadium packed full with  security men. Even when we have  security they are  always outside the stadium”.

He added that the era for attacking  players by the fans or fans fighting amongst themselves has been phased out but these days, the attacks are targeted at the match officials.

“Nobody gives referees any chance. Even in Europe they believe the referee is perfect and shouldn’t make mistakes. That day when the fans invaded pitch, Rangers was there, Kano Pillars was there but the fans were aiming for the referees which is not good.”

The football administrator called for fans to be educated to know that referees are humans capable of making mistakes and should not be attacked for that.
