Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki hit at his godfather and APC national chairman Adams Oshiomhole for the first time, publicly, since their cold war began more than eight months ago.
The governor in a press release just warned his chairman to respect party supremacy, the biggest slight a political creature can hurl at his maker.
Oshiomhole had remarked about the inauguration of the Edo State House of Assembly, and the Obaseki camp believes the chairman has vested interest.
Obaseki’s charge was contained in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie.
According to the governor’s aide, the remark about the governor false and baseless.
“We believe that he could have shown that he does not have a vested interest by simply inquiring from his friend, the governor or any official of the State Working Committee of our party as to what actually transpired,” said Crusoe Osagie.
“His failure to satisfy the basic tenets of natural justice, which makes fair hearing from all sides of a matter mandatory, has clearly exposed his bias on this issue.”
Osagie said all the decisions relating to the leadership of the Edo State House of Assembly recently elected by the House were taken by the State Working Committee and leaders of the party from across the state.
“In reference to the rule of party supremacy, which our national chairman so eloquently professes, the governor and all party members are obliged to respect the party’s decision, as we expect the national chairman to also do.”
The Oshiomhole-led national leadership objected to the emergence of Ho, Frank Okiye as Speaker of Edo’s eighth assembly last week.
