The Afenifere on Tuesday demanded for true federalism to be enthroned in the country.
They made the demand during a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
The Afenifere group was led by Pa Ayo Fasanmi.
Other requests of the group included security, education, youth employment and power supply.
The five demands of the Afenifere leaders were read by Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye.
He said: “ We seriously recommend clinging to the spirit and letters of our federal constitution. This is one sure way of achieving the desired goals of unity even in diversity, mutual respect, tolerance and giving true meaning to the opening phrase of our constitution that is, “ we the people “

“We will be a greater nation if we sincerely practice true federalism, think and act as Nigerians rather than as champions of the smaller units we were born into. Our big size is an asset worthy of preservation.
“Good examples of big size, hard work and prudent spending are the USA, China and India. It is not with violence or hate speeches but with mutual trust, self-respect and tolerance that we will speedily achieve the lofty destiny of the great country, Nigeria, ” he said.
