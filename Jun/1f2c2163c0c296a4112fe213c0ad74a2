“They said they came to arrest me following a petition. I read the petition and it was from the lawyer of Madonna University.
“I followed them and currently (Tuesday morning), we are on our way to Abuja. I will keep you posted.”
The NANS VP had planned to occupy Madonna University in protest over the arrest and detention of six students of the university and a lecturer about six months.
The students allegedly posted an opinion on Facebook considered by the university to be injurious.
