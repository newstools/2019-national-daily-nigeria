Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has contacted Eric Bailly amid interest from Arsenal, it has been claimed. Manchester United boss Solskjaer is facing a fight to keep Bailly, with Arsenal keen on signing the Ivory Coast international this transfer window.
“I know that [Arsenal] have a longstanding interest in Eric Bailly and have approached him to find out if he’d be interested in moving to Arsenal,” he said on The Transfer Window podcast.
“But the question mark in that deal has been: would they have the money to give Manchester United back what they paid to sign him three seasons ago? “That essentially came down to whether they qualified for the Champions League or not, and when they didn’t, it doesn’t look like they’re gonna have the resources to get Bailly out. And Bailly himself has been told that Solskjaer doesn’t want to sell him.”
Gary Neville has insisted that any transfer targets who are focussed solely on playing Champions League football are ‘not right’ for the club. “I’d like to think players would see beyond that in terms of what this club can do and how big it is and what it will do in the future,” he told Sky Sports. “If a player is going to choose a club based on the fact they’re not in the Champions League for one season, I would say they’re not the right player for the club. “You want players to come to United to put the club back where it belongs, which is at the very top.”
