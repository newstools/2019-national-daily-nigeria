Anthony Joshua, who recently lost the IBF, WBA and WBO world titles, was asked about potential fights with WBC world champion Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury.
“I still want to compete with those men but a rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr is where we are at,” he said.
He vowed to get the belts back after calling his sensational heavyweight world-title defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr a minor setback.
“I’m still a champ and I will rectify it to get the belts back,” he said.
Eddy Hearn, his promoter, said Joshua got “sloppy” and expects the defeat to “devastate” his fighter, adding Ruiz had pulled off “one of those big upsets in heavyweight history”.
The  29-year-old was floored four times as Ruiz defied underdog status to win in seven rounds and deliver a true shock to the sport at Madison Square Garden. He said: “It’s a test of character. I’ll see what is next and move on.”
Hearn said a rematch is a “must win” because Joshua’s options will be “nothing after that”.
A rematch clause was part of the contract and Hearn said he expected it to take place “in England in November or December”.
Ruiz himself says he will take the contest at any time.
