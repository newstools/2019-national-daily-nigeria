The globally celebrated Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka turns 85 on July 13, 2019. In marking the 85th birth anniversary, the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ) will be holding the 11th Media Lecture Series on Saturday 13 July, 2019, at MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos, at 10.00am
The Centre in a statement, sent to National Daily, indicated that Dr. Obiageli Ezekwesili, Senior Economic Advisor, Africa Economic Development Policy Initiative (AEDPI) and Co-Founder of #BringBackOurGirls Movement, will give the keynote address on the theme, ‘Rethinking credible elections, accountable democracy and good governance in Nigeria’.
The Centre also stated that the former Minister of Solid Minerals and Minister of Education, also former Vice President of the World Bank (African Region) and a Presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, Oby Ezekwesili, will be speaking along with others chosen from relevant sectors on the theme to mark Wole Soyinka’s 85th birthday.
According to the statement, the panel will discuss the urgent need to reconsider Nigeria’s electoral process in view of its complexities, how to make sure that governance becomes accountable and propound ways to make the people emerge as the greatest beneficiaries of democracy in Nigeria, while the discussants will also consider the critical role of the media in the mix. The meeting is strategic as it hopes to set the tone for the new government, the Centre noted.
It was highlighted that lecture was first held in 2008 while the Wole Soyinka Centre Media Lecture Series has since then become an annual event of the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ). “The Centre organises the lecture to raise debate on critical issues affecting Nigeria. The event has since 2009 held on 13 July, to commemorate the birthday of Africa’s first Nobel Laureate in Literature and Grand Patron of the WSCIJ, Wole Soyinka,” the statement declared.
