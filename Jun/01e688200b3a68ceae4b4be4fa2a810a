Now, chose to be called First Lady 





The wife of the President, Hajia Aisha Buhari, has reviewed the official status she wishes to be addressed in the second term of President Muhammadu Buhari.
National Dailylearned that Aisha Buhari at the presentation of awards to the former and current wives of Governors of the 36 states on Thursday at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja, declared that she has chosen henceforth to be addressed as First Lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This is contrary to the decision of President Buhari in 2015 that there will be no office of the First Lady under his leadership.  The decision was maintained through the first tenure, though the President’s wife was however engaged in several official activities in that status, relatively unofficially.
Hajia Aisha Buhari had explained that the choice of her being addressed as the wife of the president was a personal decision she took when her husband wanted to take over leadership of the country in 2015. She stated that she later realised that her decision was causing confusion among governors’ wives whether they should be addressed as First Ladies or wives of the governors.
“When my husband was elected newly, I, personally, chose to be called the wife of the President.
“But, I realised that it causes confusion from the state as to whether the wives of state governors are to be addressed as the first ladies or wives of the governors.
“So, forgive me for confusing you from the beginning, but now I chose to be called the First Lady,” she said; declaring that “this would take effect immediately.”
