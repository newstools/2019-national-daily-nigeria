Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), has received a response from the Nasarawa State Government to its Freedom of Information request for explanation on how the Nasarawa State Universal Basic Education Board “… spent Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) funds on primary school education between 2015 and 2019,
 which Commission offered explanation on the “spending of N45 million in one week to train 1,000 primary school teachers.”
SERAP acknowledged the Nasarawa State Government response in a statement by the Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, on Sunday.
National Daily learned from the statement that the government’s response followed FOI requests SERAP sent in the month of May to the Nasarawa State Universal Basic Education Board (NSUBEB), UBEC and other 35 state universal basic education boards, seeking details of spending on primary education across the country, given the poor state of education in many states of the federation.
In the letter with reference number NS/UBEB/S/OFF-69/VOL.I/XX and signed by the Board Secretary, Yakubu Ahmed Ubangari, on behalf of the Executive Chairman, the Nasarawa State Education Board disclosed: “Our counterpart fund for primary education in 2015 was N866,756,76 while the matching grant was N876,756,756,76. In 2016, our counterpart fund was N607,848,100.48 while the matching grant was N607,849,100.48. The total fund we accessed in 2015 was N1,753,513,513.52. For 2016, it was N1,215,698,200.96.”
According to the letter, “In 2015, we spent N45,000,000.00 in one week to train 1000 primary one and two teachers on Jolly Phonics teaching in our schools. The objective is to improve staff and pupil’s synthetic phonics in English language and to read and write effectively. The training took place in the 3 Senatorial district centres in the state.”
The letter with accompanying documents dated 21 May 2019, but which SERAP said it received last Friday, read in part: “We spentN13,925,336.36 to construct 3 classrooms with 1 office at Kwagshir Primary School.

SERAP said: “We are studying the large documents on spending on primary schools in Nasarawa State, with several purportedly completed but also some uncompleted. Our team is analysing the total project sums, comparing the amounts spent on projects. We will publish the full information on our website and social media platforms shortly. We have also set up a national verification group to visit the state and other states of the federation to check the status of projects against the total amounts reportedly spent and to talk to all the contractors involved.”
It would be recalled that SERAP had in an FOI request to the Nasarawa State Universal Basic Education Board stated that: “Since assuming office, Nasarawa State Government has reportedly received over N3.4 billion from Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC). Nasarawa State also reportedly received N47.6 billion from Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) in 2018, at an average of N3.97 billion monthly.”
SERAP’s FOI request read in part: “Despite the huge resources available to the State Government and the massive budgetary allocations to primary education in Nasarawa State including from the UBEC funds, several of the around 1,310 schools across the State are in shambles, and with very poor teaching facilities, thereby jeopardizing the futures of tens of thousands of Nigerian children in in the State.
“Nigeria is also a state party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which require states parties to promote transparency and accountability in the spending on education, and take steps to improve and expand quality and free education for all.”
