The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council worldwide, on Thursday, condemned the recent travel advisory issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom on 21 states in Nigeria.

Recall that the UK government in a statement had warned against all trips to Bauchi, Zamfara, Kano, Kaduna, Jigawa, Katsina, Kogi and within 20km of the border with Niger in Sokoto and Kebbi States, non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Abia States and some other states in Nigeria.

Reacting OYC’s President General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro described the report as false information filled with malicious intent.

Isiguzoro maintained that the South East was the safest haven in Nigeria for investors.

In a statement he signed, Isiguzoro said: “The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth council worldwide, contrary to malicious intent and false information of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom, declared that one or two States in South East Nigeria is(or are)among the 21 States unsafe for British National to travel to, as total fallacy and inclusion of any South East State is an error that must be corrected and debunk such unfriendly report.
