For the coming guber elections in Kogi and Bayelsa, the PDP has named the prices for its party forms: N20m for a nomination form, and N1m for expression of interest.
That is 300 percent increase from the last election.
In the last election, the form was N5m while expression of interest was N1m—for governorship aspirants.
According to the party leaders, the increase has a reason: the cost of organizing free and fair primaries is crushing
The decision was made at the party’s 86th Emergency National Executive Council, NEC, meeting at the headquarters in Abuja on Thursday.
Speaking after the meeting, PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, assured that the party would conduct a free, fair and credible primary in Bayelsa and Kogi states to produce credible candidates in the coming months.
“The return of expression of interest/nomination forms would commence on Monday, June 24 and close on Wednesday, July 24 at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja,” he added.
Also, a document signed by PDP National Organizing Secretary, Col. Austin Akobundu (RTD) disclosed that sales and return of expression of interest/nomination forms would commence on Monday, June 24 and close Wednesday, July 24 at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja.
