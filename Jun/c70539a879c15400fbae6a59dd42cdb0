John Odigie-Oyegun, immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has hit hard at his successor Adams Oshiomhole, describing his tactics and leadership skills as those of ‘agberos’.
He said this in a press release by his public affairs aide  exonerating himself from the crisis facing the party in Zamfara and other states of the federation.
The chairmen of the party in the six states across the south south had risen in defence of Oshiomhole, alleging the current challenges facing the party as a “landmine” left behind by Odigie-Oyegun’s administration.
The party’s National Deputy Chairman Lawal Shuaibu last Tuesday spiked a personal feud that spilled into the media, asking Oshiomhole to step down for lack of leadership.
But the former chairman also insisted Oshiomhole truly lacks the leadership capacity to move the party forward.
“Oshiomhole fails because he lacks the temperament required to run a political party.
“He lacks the capacity to manage different interests and tendencies that constitute a political party.
“He engages his mouth before engaging his mind, so he offends party members, so how does that constitute traps by Oyegun,” Odigie-Oyegun wondered.
He recalled that already, the APC Deputy National Chairman (North) had confirmed that Oshiomhole runs the party without recourse to its National Working Committee (NWC) and acts in direct opposite to its decisions.
Odigie-Oyegun noted that many party men were against Oshiomhole because of unfair treatment and injustice meted on them during the party’s last primaries ahead of the 2019 general elections.
“Only a bad carpenter quarrels with his tools, indeed Oshiomhole is degrading and de-marketing the party, rather than seek to bring more people on board, he is chasing people out of the party with his agbero style of engagement,”Odigie-Oyegun said.
