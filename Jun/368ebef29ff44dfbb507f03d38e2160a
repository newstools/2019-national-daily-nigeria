The petitioner at the Katsina State Election Tribunal, Yakubu Lado, has declared that Governor Aminu Bello Masari ‘s documents with INEC suggested that the governor and his father were born the same year, and are both 69 now.
Lado insisted that an affidavit deposed to by Governor Masari’s father, Umaru Bello showed that, while his son was born on May 29, 1950, his father was 51 years as at the time of declaration on August 9, 2001, exactly 69 years in 2019 and the same age with his son.
He also pointed out that dates of birth on Masari’s primary school leaving certificate differs from the sworn declaration of age.
“While the declaration of age indicated that Masari was born in 1950, the primary certificate on the other hand stated that he was born in 1951,” Lado said.
The National Daily gathered that the petitioner also claimed the primary school certificate in question belongs to one Aminu Bello, a Fulani. But the governor, claiming same document, is known and addressed as Aminu Bello Masari, Hausa by tribe.
Addressing journalists shortly after the sitting in Katsina, Lado’s counsel Gordy Uche stated that it was clear from the testimony of the first witness that Masari has no educational qualification for the post of a governor.
But, counsel to the governor, Tunde Busari, dismissed the allegations.
According to him, Masari qualified to contest the post of governor, adding that he (Masari) had been Speaker of the House of Representatives and had served four years as governor.
APC’s counsel Ernest Obunadike also said the party ready to test this issue in court.
“Let them prove their allegation before the court. Once a matter is in court, you don’t discuss it this way. It is unfortunate that they have done so.”
