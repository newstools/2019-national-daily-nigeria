The Super Falcons of Nigeria eventually qualified for the Round of 16 of the FIFA Women’s World Cup.
It took some few dashed hopes before the team clinched the round 16 spot as one of four best losers.
Chile needed to beat Thailand more than 2-0 to snatch away the last Best Losers spot. But could only beat Thailand 2-0.
Here was how Ediale Kingsley captured the situation before the Thailand game. His Facebook post after the Cameroon versus New Zealand game:
Cameroon took the available 3rd slot. It was the last kick…2-1 against New Zealand.
Now Chile and Nigeria fights for the last slot!
For Nigeria to go ahead. Thailand who conceded 13-0 in a match, 17-0 in two matches must not concede up to 3.
You see how Nigerians like to disturb God?
Now God has to consider a decision to intervene.
Only God can write the script for Nigeria. And scripts is about scenes. If Scene One is making it to Round of 16. What about Scene Two?
For Scene Two…Nigeria must defeat Germany.

If these two things happen. Go and sell that land and place a bet on Bet9ja that Nigeria will win the World Cup.
Cos, God doesn’t write scene one and two if he doesn’t want to take the full credits!
Nigeria will next face Germany on Saturday at 4.30PM Nigerian time.
