Former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has some issues to clarify over the prosecution of former National Security Adviser (NSA) Sambo Dasuki, before a legal disciplinary committee.
National Daily learned that the hard that Malami will be facing the Disciplinary Panel of the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee over a prejudicial statement made against detained former National Security Adviser, Colonel Sambo Dasuki, who has been under prosecution since 2015.
It was gathered that the Hearing Notice dated 16th May 2019, was signed by Patricia Orhomuru, Secretary of the Disciplinary Committee.
The notice indicated that the panel will be sitting at the Office of the Supreme Court registrar in Abuja.
Malami was said to be investigated by the panel for a statement credited to him in the Voice of America, Hausa Service, on 13th July 2018 in which he was reportedly quoted to have said that Dasuki would not be released despite all subsisting court orders to be released on bails.

In the audio recording of the interview he granted VOA, Malami had alleged that Dasuki was responsible for the death of over 100,000 Nigerians during President Goodluck Jonathan’s term in Office.
In the petition dated 23 July 2018 received by the NBA the same day, the family wants Malami to be investigated in the resolve of the Federal Government not to comply with any order of court admitting the former NSA to bail and has been unjustly detained for almost four years.
Meanwhile, the former AGF is awaiting the ministerial list of President Muhammadu Buhari to confirm if he gets re0appoitment in the second term.
