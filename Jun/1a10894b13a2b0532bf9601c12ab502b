Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno is set to join Villarreal, according to Marca.
Moreno, 26, is out of contract at Anfield in July and has already agreed personal terms with the La Liga side.
It’s claimed the announcement will be made on Monday with the paperwork already signed by both parties.
Moreno arrived at Anfield from Sevilla in 2014 for £12million, but lost his place to Andrew Robertson – making just two Premier League appearances last season.
