President of Supporters Club, Prince Vincent Okumagba has given a pat on the back to the Super Falcons declaring that there was nothing to take away from the girls even if they fail to make it to the knockout stage of the France 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup.


Okumagba told National Daily that he returned to the country recently after cheering and mobilizing support for the Falcons in France said the girls put up a good show against the hosts Monday night in the game that ended 1-0 in favor of France.

He added that truth is that no body gave the Falcons any chance against France. Many people thought they were going to be roasted by a wide margin. The Falcons came out strong and determined to get a result and they were almost going to do that until the late penalty drama orchestrated by the Honduran referee. If France had scored the first kick, I doubt if the referee would have called for a re take.

And come to look at it, the French player threw away the first kick outrightly, so it was not a case of our keeper’s movement giving her an undue advantage that led to a save. On the whole, even if the girls come home now, they have put up a decent performance. I know many Nigerians want them to go far in the tournament, but sometimes things don’t go a team’s way,” Okumagba said.

The Super Eagles Supporters Club boss said he is home to focus attention on how to hit Egypt with his men ahead of Eagles first game against Burundi this weekend.
“We intend to storm Egypt with 200 of our members. We have a new song for the Eagles and we intend to give the team maximum support,”
