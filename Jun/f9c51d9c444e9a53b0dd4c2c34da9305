Mupwaya, who said that the division comprised nine members, selected from the technical and safety departments headed by the Director of Risk and Compliance, Mr Collins Chabuka, explained that the initiative was part of the management’s efforts to avoid any fatality or injury of its field officers.
He explained: “It is better for any fault to remain unattended to if it will result to the death of any worker or members of the public.
“Any staff who does any act adjudged to be capable of causing any accident or electrocution will be sanctioned, including losing his job”, Mupwaya added.
According to him, the division is saddled with the responsibility of stopping any unauthorised work within AEDC’s network and sanctioning any staff that violates any safety standards.
