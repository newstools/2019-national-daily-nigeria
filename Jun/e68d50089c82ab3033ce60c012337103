The Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission has described the claim by the Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi II, that he was not the accounting officer of the Kano Emirate Council, as a misrepresentation of facts.
This was contained in a preliminary report of the Commission on the investigation being carried out in respect of the alleged misappropriation of over N3.4 billion by the Kano Emirate Council between 2014 and 2017.
The report was signed by the Commission’s Chairman, Magaji Muhuyi Rimingado, and addressed to the Secretary to the State Government. A copy was made available to newsmen in Kano on Thursday.
The Commission alleged that all the expenditures made by the Emirate Council were either based on the approval or instructions of Emir Sanusi.
