Two security guards on an estate at Ojomo, Akure, Ondo, were high on Tramadol and Indian hemp the day they killed their 71 year old employer, and then his 27-year old graduate daughter preparing for her national youth service.
Tasiu Abubakar and Ayuba Idris later took off to Kano and Sokoto where the long arms of the law fished them out—with their spoils: their master’s suits, phones, and laptop.
They were paraded at the headquarters of the command on Monday for allegedly killing Richard Kwakye and his daughter Tope last month.
According to the state Commissioner of Police Undie Adie, Kwakye and her daughter were initially declared missing. After the guards were arrested, they confessed that they killed the two, and threw their bodies away.
The CP stated Ayuba Idris, 20, was arrested in Kano on May 16, 2019. Kwake’s handset and his suits were recovered from him.
“Upon interrogation, he confessed that he and the second security guard, Taisu Abubakar, knew where the two missing persons were. He led detectives to a building on the Ojomo Akintan Estate, Olu Foam area of Akure, where the decomposing bodies of Richard Kwakye, 71, and Tope Kwakye, 27, were found.
“The detectives also tracked down Taisu Abubakar, 23, in Sokoto State. One of the victims’ laptops and some clothes were recovered from him. Upon interrogation, he also confessed to the murder of the victims.
In his confession, Abubakar said the man never offended them but they carried out the act under the influence of Tramadol and Indian hemp.
As he was being strangulated, his daughter saw them.
“So we killed her too in order to cover up,” he said.
Police said the two suspects will be charged to court.
The remains of their victims have been deposited in a mortuary.
