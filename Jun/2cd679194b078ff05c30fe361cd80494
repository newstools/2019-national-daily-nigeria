Ambassador Babagana Kingibe has alleged that former President Olusegun Obasanjo was one of those behind the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election.
The former SGF who was the running mate of late MKO Abiola said this while appearing on Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, June 12
According to him, Obasanjo attempted to convene a meeting of statesmen, including Muhammadu Buhari then, to address the June 12 crisis at the African Leadership Forum.
“And I think President Muhammadu Buhari did attend the meeting once, the inaugural meeting. I understood that when he (Buhari) saw the direction of the meeting, he decided not to attend again.
“Every time the issue of the annulment came up over the years, his position was very clear; he was very firm that the election was free, fair and there was a clear winner. And that the annulment was unjustified,’ said Kingibe.
He added that having had the opportunity, perhaps, to right the wrong, Buhari had to right the wrong, even if it is belated.
“it is in his character to try and do justice, however, belated and under whatever circumstances.”
Kingibe and the late Abiola ran on the platform of the Social Democratic Party then, and were adjudged winner of Nigeria’s freest and fairest election in the election against Ahmed Tofa of the National Republican Congress.
