APC’s Sen. Ahmed Lawan gunning for the Senate presidency has got over 61 of his colleagues in the APC behind him in readiness for the June 11 election.
Lawan said this on Saturday while his campaign organization was reading out the list of endorsements. 
Only two out of the 63 APC senators-elect had yet to endorse him.
Basically, his rival and APC Sen. Ali Ndume has just one backer from his own party. Lawan also said about 38 Peoples Democratic Party senators-elect out of 44 have promised to vote for him.
The only senator from the Young Progressives Party,  Ifeanyi Uba, has also signed the list.
