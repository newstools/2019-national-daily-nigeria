The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal on Monday dismissed the application filed by Atiku Abubakar and the PDP, seeking to inspect INEC server allegedly used in collating results for the Feb. 23 general election.
Justice Mohammed Garba, Chairman of the panel, held that granting such application at this interlocutory stage would preempt the substantive petition.
Atiku and his party have insisted that the result of the Feb 23 presidential election were manipulated on INEC server, where they were transmitted, to favour the APC candidate President Muhammadu Buhari.
