After a week-long Sports Competition at the Lt Gen Tukur Buratai’s Sports Complex at Ikeja Cantonment, Lagos, the 81 Division Garrison of the Nigerian Army has emerged the overall winner of the 2019 Inter Formation Sports Competition.

The event which was rounded off at the weekend, saw the emergence of the garrison beating other formations within the Division. However, 9 Brigade took the second and 55 Signal Brigade, third positions respectively.

The Special Guest of Honour, Maj.-Gen Kamilu Kadiri, in his remarks described training as the “bedrock of the military.”

He explained that constant training prepares the military to discharge their statutory responsibilities including defending the territorial integrity of the country.

“Healthy competitions like the one we just witnessed are indeed crucial for the promotion of emotional stability, self-discipline and self-realisation in the individual.

“I believe these attributes are important to every soldier in the army for the enhancement of the soldier’s ability to discharge his duties,” he said.

It was further learnt that the primary aim of the Inter Formations/Units Sports Competition was organised to improve on training standard, sportsmanship of personnel, promote spirit-de-corp and encourage participation of troops in sporting activities.

“The competition usually affords all formations within 81 Division opportunities to compete favourably among one another.

“It is therefore important that your level of physical fitness is maintained and improved at all times,” he said.

On his part, the General Officer Commanding, (GOC) 81 Division, MajbGen. Musa Yusuf, noted that the competition was also to promote the spirit of comradeship among personnel.

To ensure maximum participation, the formations and units under 81 Division were grouped into eight and the events competed for included football, volley ball, table tennis, squash, badminton and combat race.
