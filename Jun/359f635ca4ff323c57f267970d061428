The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has reportedly written Mastercard Inc and Visa Inc requesting for details of credit cards used by Azeez Fashola popularly known as Naira Marley.

The anti-graft agency said the cards it recovered from the artiste were used for alleged identity theft and credit card fraud.

As stated in the document obtained by Punch, the EFCC wrote Mastercard and Visa on Monday, May 13, 2019, three days after the music star was arrested.

The letter titled ‘Investigation Activities’ was signed by Dein Whyte, the Zonal Head, EFCC, Lagos.
