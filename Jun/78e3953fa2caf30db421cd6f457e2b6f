T.B. Joshua of the Synagogue was a darling to Israel three years ago because of the millions the nation stood to gain in tourism revenue when the crowd-puller of a prophet contemplated moving his Lagos church there.

The Hadash and Youth for Change parties in Nazareth were said to have also cited Joshua’s source of wealth as part of their concerns.
