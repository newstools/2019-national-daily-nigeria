Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, had warned a South West leader and national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to be careful in his political alliance with Fulani politicians.

He urged Tinubu to learn from history how every relationship any South West leader had with the Fulani in the past ended up.

There are speculations that Tinubu is nursing the ambition to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.

Fani-Kayode, apparently supposing that Tinubu wants to achieve his alleged aspiration using his present relationship with Buhari and other Fulani politicians wrote on his official Twitter handle:

“Every single notable leader from the SW that formed an alliance with the Fulani ended up regretting it and paying a price. From Afonja, to Akintola, to Fani-Kayode, to Awolowo (during the civil war) to Abiola, to Bola Ige and to Obasanjo.
