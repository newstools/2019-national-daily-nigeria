Chairmen of the 16 local government areas in Kwara State have challenged Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq in court questioning his dissolution of the local government councils on contempt he inherited from the past administration.
The 16 LG chairmen argued that there was a subsisting court order restraining the governor from suspending or dissolving the councils which they said Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq undermined.
The local government chairmen protested that were elected in 2017 on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) but they later defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the buildup to the 2019 general elections. They insisted that their tenure will elapse in November 2020, lamenting that the Kwara State APC House of Assembly made a resolution empowering Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq suspend the LG chairmen and councilors for six months citing misappropriation of public funds.
