In 101 years’ time, Nigeria’s most populated city Lagos will move higher and become largest city in the world.
By then, 88 million people will be crammed into the state with the smallest land mass in Nigeria..
Global consulting firm Mercer said this in a statement by its Head of Strategy and Geographic Expansion, Pearl Siffel. during the launch of a new study in partnership with a human resources and management consulting firm, EZ37 Solutions.
The study was entitled ‘People first: Driving growth in emerging megacities,’.

It was launched in Lagos, and it examined the needs of workers in the 15 fastest growing cities across four key factors which were human, health, money and work.

According to her, Lagos was important for such a study because it remained the most populous city in Africa, adding that the study would not have been completed without Lagos.

She also added there are more babies born in Nigeria than in Europe.

Siffel said, “Findings reveals that 42 per cent of workers are very comfortable with overall satisfaction with life. Ninety-three per cent of workers say that access to employer-subsidised health and wellness programmes is important to them.

“What organisations and the cities need to do is to focus more on those needs and the people’s skills will be a competitive advantage to organisations while technology will drive the process.”

Lagos is currently the largest city in Africa, and the fifth in the world.
