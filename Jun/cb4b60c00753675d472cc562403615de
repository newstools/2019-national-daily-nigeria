Jose Mourinho sought out Iker Casillas to give him a warm hug when the pair were in Paris to celebrate Gianni Infantino’s re-election as FIFA president.
Mourinho and Casillas never really saw eye to eye during their time together at Real Madrid, but they have put those differences aside in recent weeks.
When Casillas suffered a heart attack during Porto training last month, Mourinho contacted the Portuguese club’s medical staff directly to ask how the goalkeeper was.
Florentino Perez was also at the event in Paris and he and Mourinho greeted each other in a friendly manner as well.
