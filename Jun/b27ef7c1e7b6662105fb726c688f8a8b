The statement of former President Goodluck Jonathan that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo took lies to the United States on the situation in Nigeria during his recent visit, got an international support from a former Acting Assistant Secretary to the United State of America (USA) Secretary of Defence, Mr. Frank Gaffney, who National Daily gathered blasted the Nigeria’s Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, on the social media as “shamelessly” lying about the killing of Christians in Nigeria.

It was gathered that Frank Gaffney Jr., now President of the Centre for Security Policy, CSP, a Columnist for The Washington Times, and Host of the nationally syndicated program, Secure Freedom Radio, in a podcast declared: “US Vice President, Mike Pence, will have today, what could be a decisive meeting for tens of millions of Christians in Nigeria, now facing the prospect of genocide and forced mass emigration.

“Mr. Pence’s visitor is a man who should be on their side, his Nigerian counterpart, Yemi Osinbajo. After all, he is one of the very few Christians in a Nigerian government, otherwise dominated by Islamist Fulani tribesmen.
“Unfortunately, Osinbajo is instead part of the problem.
“He lies shamelessly, including this weekend, in New York, about the anti-Christian persecution his government is at least tolerating, and at worst, enabling.
“Osinbajo’s own tribe has sharply repudiated him for doing so.
“If Vice President Pence makes clear that all the persecutors in Nigeria will be held accountable and face penalties, he may be able to prevent a catastrophe there, on his and President Trump’s watch.”
