Workz Group, Mobile and IoT solutions provider, has announced a long-term partnership with the manufacturer of mobile IoT modules to deliver a projected 50 million embedded SIMs (eSIMs) by 2024.
The deal sees Workz provide secure data generation, management and personalisation for eSIM chips to be deployed globally by the cellular module leader for use in machine-to-machine (M2M) devices.
Workz, which offers eSIM technology and cloud management platforms to device manufacturers, network operators, technology enablers and governments, was recognised in an industry report by BIS Research earlier this year as a key player in the eSIM market.
Workz is the only GSMA-certified manufacturer of eSIM technology (EUM) in the Middle East and Africa.
The certification guarantees the secure management of data both physically and virtually during production and personalisation of eSIMs.
Personalisation refers to the upload of the SIMâ€™s unique information to its smart chip.
Workz is one of only six providers in the world to carry such accreditation and possesses two certified facilities located in Dubai and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
