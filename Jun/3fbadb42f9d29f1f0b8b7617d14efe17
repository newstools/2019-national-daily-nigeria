The incoming Group Managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, on Sunday, raised alarm over attempts by fraudsters to impersonate him.

Kyari, on his Twitter account, clarified that he has no Facebook account as was being claimed.

“My attention has been drawn to some Facebook accounts claiming to be Mele Kyari bent on defrauding the general public.

“Please note that I do not currently have any Facebook account and will never transact any business on social media platforms.

“Kindly disregard any account on Facebook claiming to be Mele Kyari. Thank you.”

Kumari, whose appointment takes effect 8 July, replaces Dr. Maikanti Baru as the 19th head of the national oil company.

Until his new appointment, Kyari, a geologist, was Group General Manager, Crude Oil Marketing Division of NNPC and also doubled, since 13th May, 2018, as Nigeria’s National Representative to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC.
