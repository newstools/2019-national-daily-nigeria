For so long now, Lionel Messi has been trying to find someone with whom he can successfully link up when playing for Argentina. Over the last few years, there has been a distinct lack of creativity and talent in the middle of the park for the Argentine national side.

Spain had it in abundance with Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez, as did Germany, France, Belgium and Croatia with Toni Kroos, Paul Pogba, Kevin De Bruyne and Luka Modric, respectively.

Argentina lack this and instead find themselves with players who are more suited to winning the ball back for their side.

That said, it appears that Messi has finally found his perfect match in the form of Giovani Lo Celso, the Real Betis player, with whom Messi has linked up perfectly since his call up to the national side, as was demonstrated their recent goal glut against Nicaragua.

Lo Celso has a wicked left-foot, on top of his x-ray vision and ability to pick out and pinpoint passes, all of which have helped Messi to do what he does best. The Copa America in Brazil will be the first real test to see whether they can continue to link up as exquisitely as they have been against lesser opposition.
