Governor Sanwo-Ou also remarked that the road from the National theatre  to Maza-Maza has been completed but has become impassable due to indiscriminate dumping of refuse and misuse by traders, assuring that massive clean-up will take place in the coming week.

“We started the journey from Orile Iganmu through Maza-Maza, and finally here at the Trade Fair. The road from National Arts Theatre up to Maza-Maza has actually been constructed but unfortunately the refuse on the road has not made the work shown.

“There are lots of infrastructure on the road including the railway line. The refuse had not allowed us see the road. I don’t know how it will take but it’s going to be a major task force to clean up that corridor,” Sanwo-Olu said

He expressed readiness to partner with the Federal Government to find a lasting solution to the road from Okokomaiko to Agbara to Seme-border.
