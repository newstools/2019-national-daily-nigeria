The lawsuit between MTN Group, South African telecommunications giant and the government of Nigeria was on Wednesday adjourned until October 19.
The case involved a $2 billion tax dispute.
Abubakar Malami, attorney general of Nigeria, on behalf of the President Muhammadu Buhari government had demanded MTN to pay the $2 billion last September.
The telecommunication company, however, claimed that the requested tax money was without merit, accusing the attorney general of exceeding his powers in making the request.
The adjournment of the case was moved by lawyers representing the Nigerian government.
MTN through Funso Aina, senior manager, External Relations “We are confident in the Nigerian court system and the rule of law and look forward to presenting our case at the earliest possible opportunity.
MTN Nigeria maintains its stand that we are in full compliance with all extant tax and regulatory obligations. We reiterate our commitment to obeying all Nigerian laws, rules and regulations that govern and guide our business practices.” he added
