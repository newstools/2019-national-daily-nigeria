APC’s Deputy National Chairman Lawan Shuaibu has been expelled from the state chapter of the party for his role in sabotaging the party’s National Working Committee.
Shuaibu had gotten above himself lately, spoiling for war with his chairman Adams Oshiomhole who he asked in letter seven days ago to resign.
The table has turned now.

Both were expelled on Monday for sabotaging the party in the 2019 election.
The decision to expel Yari and Shuaibu was taken at the end of an emergency meeting held in Gusau, the Zamfara state capital.
A statement jointly signed by the chairman of the party in Zamfara, Alhaji Surajo Garba Mai Katako and the Publicity Secretary, Muhammad Bello Bakyasuwa, said the expulsion was sequel to the electoral misfortune, Yari and his co-travelers exposed the party to in Zamfara.
“ After reviewing the outing of our party in the last general election and the outcome of the Supreme Court Judgement, we hereby dismiss the former governor of Zamfara state, Abdulaziz Yari and the Deputy National Chairman Sen Lawali Shuaibu from the APC.
‘Following this development, we are urging them to immediately surrender all the belongings of the party in their possession including funds.
“ Yari and his boys scuttled the efforts of our national headquarters to conduct primaries on the 3rd and 7th of October 2018. His nefarious activities led to the death of six persons and over 200 others were injured,” the party said.
The party said the expulsion would be communicated to its national headquarters for appropriate action by Thursday.
