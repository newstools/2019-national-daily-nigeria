Real Madrid have signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea on a five-year contract after completing the most expensive transfer ever involving an English club.

Madrid are understood to have struck a deal with Chelsea that could rise to £130 million once all bonus payments come into play. The 28-year-old will be officially unveiled on Thursday, June 13, after he has undergone his medical.

As reported by Telegraph Sport on Thursday, negotiations between the clubs had been taking place all week. Real had been reluctant to pay more than £88m for the Belgian, but eventually agreed to a deal that is set to earn Chelsea as much as £130m once all the bonuses have been met.
