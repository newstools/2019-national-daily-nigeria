Orders proper handover in 24hrs





The Cold War between Governor Emeka Ihedioha and his predecessor, former Governor Rochas Okorocha, has been deepening as the new governor settles down to deliver good governance to the people of Imo State after his inauguration on May 29.
Governor Ihedioha on Monday encountered former Governor Okorocha over untidy handover notes left behind which was not formally presented to the incumbent before exit from office.  Ihedioha, therefore, ordered the Permanent Secretary, and Head of Service, under Okorocha, to prepare all the necessary documents and hand them over to the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) and Chief of Staff, before midnight on Tuesday, June 4th.
The governor issued the order at the swearing in of the new Chief of Staff and Secretary to the State Government.
Ihedioha had declared: “I direct Head of Service and Permanent Secretary, to ensure a complete handover of all government properties, the last administration utilised on behalf of Imo people to SSG and Chief of Staff of Imo state government. I want the process to be completed by midnight tomorrow.
“I spoke to Imo people that we will start work we will resume work. We will give no excuses of not performing. We will give dividend of democracy irrespective of the status of the state of facilities I inherited.
