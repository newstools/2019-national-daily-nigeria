Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has appointed a new management headed by Mutiu Sunmonu  to oversee the affairs of Oando Plc.

This is coming on the heels of a recent order by SEC for the resignation of the Management team headed by Wale Tinubu, indicted for financial Infractions.

 “Further to our Press Release on Oando Plc, dated May 31, 2019, the Commission hereby informs the public of the constitution of an Interim Management Team headed by Mr. Mutiu Olaniyi Adio Sunmonu CON, to oversee the affairs of Oando Plc, and conduct an Extra Ordinary General Meeting on or before July 1, 2019 to appoint new Directors to the Board of the Company, who would subsequently select a Management Team for Oando Plc,” SEC disclosed in the statement.



“The Commission wishes to reiterate its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the market,” it continued.
