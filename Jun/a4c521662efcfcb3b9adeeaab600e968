The Coach of Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) of Ibadan, Edith Agoye,has reveled the main focus of the Ibadan-based team is to return to the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) next football season where he said the team truly belongs.


The former 3SC player explained this after his team dumped NPFL side, Katsina United, out of this year’s Aiteo Cup round of 32 games played at the FIFA Goal Project pitch package B of the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja on Wednesday.

He said despite playing in the lower cadre of Nigerian football, 3SC still remain a big club with the sole aim of winning every game it is participating in. He expressed the optimism that the 1995 Nigeria league champions will go all the way in this year’s Aiteo Cup.

“Naturally when you play a game and you win, the feeling is always of joy, happiness and satisfaction having achieved your aim. The target for 3SC is to get back to the premier league and I think we are in a very good stead.

It has given us the opportunity to concentrate on the Aiteo Cup, we want to play every game and give our best. At the end of the day we want to see how far we can go but hopefully, we want to go
all the way.”

“We won this game against an NPFL side like Katsina United, though avery strong side, with what they did in the just concluded football season because we (3SC) is the better side. Forget the fact that Shooting Stars is playing in the Nigeria National League (NNL).
