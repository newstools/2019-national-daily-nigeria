The Nigeria Police at the weekend prohibited any form of mass action which include rally, demonstration, procession or assembly in Kano State until further notice. The Kano State Police Command noted that the action was necessary to forestall breakdown of law and order as well as open the space for the Police to effectively monitor the insecurity challenges in the state.
The Public Relations Officer of the Kano State Police Command, Abdullahi Haruna, declared that the Police had withdrawn permission given to members of the public, civil society organisations, political parties, NGOs and other groups for public activities.
It was observed that the impasse between Governor Abdulahi Ganduje and Emir Sanusi Muhammad II, has been generating tension in the state, essentially, as the governor was mobbing closer to dethroning the Emir.

National Daily recalls that the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission had recommended the suspension of the Emir under the guise that during its investigation, it uncovered that N3.4 billion was misspent by the emirate under Sanusi. There was also report on Saturday that two Palace aides loyal to Emir Sanusi were suspended by the state government.
Meanwhile, Governor Ganduje and Emir Sanusi after a reconciliatory meeting in Abuja on Friday convened by Alhaji Aliko Dangote and Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, resolved the impasse and re-united again. The development significantly doused the tension in Kano State.
