The Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) on Friday issued the federal government 24 hours ultimatum to re-open the AIT and Raypower radio stations shutdown by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC). The NUJ noted that the union was alarmed at the closure of the AIT by the National Broadcasting Commission, expressing the belief that the action portends grave danger for the free press and independent media in Nigeria.
The NUJ President, Chris Isiguzo, in a statement on Friday contested that Independent and pluralistic media in a democracy, like Nigeria, serve to promote democracy by their dissemination of authentic information and ensuring transparency in governance.

The union therefore, condemned the closure over allegations of breach of 2004 broadcasting code, insisting that there are better ways of sanctioning media organizations that are found to have erred.
NUJ noted that it will be helpful if the National Broadcasting Commission will immediately re-open AIT to ensure that they continue to promote debate and opinions on issues that are of social economic and political importance to the nation.
The union, therefore, said it expects the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, to do the needful in 24 hours.
