Arsenal youngster Jordi Osei-Tutu has joined VfL Bochum on a season-long loan. Osei-Tutu, 20, was named on the bench for two Premier League fixtures in the 2017/18 season but injuries restricted him to just 11 appearances with Arsenal’s Under-23 squad last term. The full-back joins the 2. Bundesliga outfit to gain regular first-team football. An Arsenal statement read: “We wish Jordi the best of luck for his time with Bochum. The loan deal is subject to the completion of regulatory processes.”
Also, Nabil Fekir is set to make a move. AC Milan are interested in signing Lyon midfielder Nabil Fekir. The 25-year-old has one year remaining on his contract with Lyon, who might have to cash in this summer to avoid losing him on a free transfer next year. France Football claim AC Milan want to tempt him to the San Siro, and £34million could be enough to conclude a deal. There’s no mention of Liverpool, who were close to finalising a move for Fekir last summer before it fell through over a disagreement about his long-term fitness.
