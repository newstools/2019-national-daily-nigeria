Justice Ayokunle Faji of the Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday issued a bench warrant for the arrest of Chief Executive Officer, CEO, of Innosson Nigeria Ltd, Innocent Chukwuma and two others, over alleged fraud.

The Federal Government had a week ago urged the Court to issue a bench warrant for Chukwuma and some of his employees.

The Police had earlier charged them for an alleged N2.4 billion shipping fraud, but the then Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), later took over the case.

Others named in the charge are: Charles Chukwuma, Maximian Chukwura, Mitsui Osk Lines and Anajekwu Sunny.

The prosecution prayed the court to order the arrest of Innoson Motors Chairman and his staff for failing to turn up to take their plea in the criminal charge.

Last week’s Monday, Chukwuma and his staff were absent in court.

Prosecuting counsel, Julius Ajakaiye moved an application, urging the court to order the absent defendants’ arrested, saying that the charge was served on them through a court-ordered February 8, 2016 substituted service following the AGF’s take-over of the case.

Consequently, he said the defendants were yet to take their plea and should therefore be compelled to appear, adding that an April 12, 2016 amended charge could not be served on the absent defendants, urging the court to grant his application by ordering their arrest.
