Fast bowler Mark Wood is set to undergo a fitness test on Friday morning ahead of England’s World Cup match against West Indies, National Daily gathered.
Wood, who has bowled the fastest delivery (154kph) in the tournament to date, reported discomfort in his left ankle following Saturday’s victory over Bangladesh.
With rain forcing England to abandon most of their plans for outdoor training plans since, he has little chance to assess the severity of the problem.

“His ankle is a little bit sore at the moment,” England captain Eoin Morgan said. “We haven’t bowled for a few days so it depends how he feels when he bowls in the morning. If it’s still sore, we probably won’t take a risk.”
England had better news of Jos Buttler. He was able to take full part in training on Friday – he even performed some keeping drills in the driving rain
