The immediate past Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed has indicated interest to be re-appointed to continue leading the finance ministry for another four years.

The former minister reportedly made her interest known on Tuesday while speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing Bloomberg Emerging and Frontier Forum in London. Mrs. Ahmed revealed she would like to be reappointed as minister of finance to complete several projects she flagged off.

“The president is in the process of putting together a new cabinet. I have not had a discussion with him on whether I am coming back on the cabinet or not.

“I would like to go back to the cabinet in the same role to continue the work that we started. “I was only there for nine months, I started a lot of initiatives that I would love to push.”

Recall that Zainab Ahmed was appointed by the president to oversee the Ministry of Finance in September 2018 after the former Finance Minister, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun resigned following an allegation that she presented a fake NYSC exemption certificate as part of the requirements for clearance as a minister by the Senate.

Zainab Ahmed, along with other ministers, were relieved from their various ministerial positions at the expiration of their tenures. While Nigerians await the much-anticipated list from the President, the permanent secretaries have been duly delegated to run the ministeries.

Information released by Mrs. Ahmed Zainab on her LinkedIn page reveals that the Permanent Secretary of the Finance Ministry is supposedly in charge of affairs of the ministry.

In the meantime, while President Buhari has not given hints on the new ministers, other prominent Nigerians have been mooted for the seat of the finance minister.
