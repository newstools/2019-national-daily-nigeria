The Aare Ona Kakaanfo of Yoruba land, Gani Adams, has warned that no portion of Yoruba land is available for allocation to the Fulani herdsmen for cattle ranching. He cautioned that any attempt to forcefully take over any part of the south west for the Fulani herdsmen may lead to war, adding that he remains a warrior and will never give ion to cowardice. He strongly warned the governors in the south west not to allocate any portion of land in the territory for the Miyetti Allah being sponsored by the federal government.
He vowed to protect the Yoruba land unto Kwara and Kogi states.
The Aare Ona Kakaanfo of Yoruba land in a statement declared: “No Governor in South West should allocate any portion of our land for cattle ranching or colony. Our history will not forget and forgive anyone of them who does so.
“Our land is not available for Miyetti Allah, so they should find other place or other means of rearing their cattle.
“I am a warrior and I am not afraid and the Yorubas are not afraid of any tribes who are giving us problems.
“I am only waiting for approval from my Kings because they have the final say on this issue. I am not limiting this struggle to the South West only but to the States like Kogi and Kwara States where we have Yoruba society. We won’t allow insecurity to overwhelm us.
“We will not allow it to distract us from pursuing restructuring agenda. We should do whatever we have to do to deliver ourselves. I can still roll out one million Yoruba people.”
