Imo Gov. Emeka Ihedioha has given the immediate past Governor of Imo, Rochas Okorocha up to midnight of Tuesday June 4, 2019 to do a proper handover to his government.
Ihedioha gave the order at the Government House in Owerri, while he was swearing into office of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Uche Onyeaguocha and Chief of Staff, Chris Okewulonu.
The governor afterwards ordered the Permanent Secretary, and Head of Service, under Okorocha, to quickly prepare all the necessary documents and hand them over to the SSG, and Chief of Staff, before tomorrow’s midnight.
He also wanted Imo people who desired to have a feel of the dilapidation in the government house at the moment, to feel free to do so.
Ihedioha’s warning is coming days after it was reported in Vanguard that he claimed that it has been very difficult for him as governor to operate from the current Imo state government House and in addition, he did not have documents to work on as a governor.
As it is now, the governor is yet to make public where he will be operating from as governor of the state.
“I direct Head of Service and Permanent Secretary, to ensure a complete handover of all government properties, the last administration utilised on behalf of Imo people to SSG and Chief of Staff of Imo state government. I want the process to be completed by midnight tomorrow,’ he said.
“I spoke to Imo people that we will start work we will resume work. We will give no excuses of not performing. We will give dividend of democracy irrespective of the status of the state of facilities I inherited.
“The government that ended was not prepared to handover or ready to receive us. I thank Imo people for receiving us and we shall serve the state with the fear of God.”
