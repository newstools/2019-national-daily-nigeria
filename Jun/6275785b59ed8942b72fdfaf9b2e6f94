Arsenal are confident they’ll get a deal for Celtic’s Kieran Tierney over the line. The Gunners have already seen their opening £15million offer rejected by the Scottish Premiership champions, who value the 22-year-old at £25m. The Telegraph are reporting that Unai Emery’s side are optimistic about agreeing a deal with Celtic and are prepared to up their bid to £18m. It’s said Emery hopes Tierney will have a similar impact to that of Andrew Robertson at Liverpool. Arsenal are confident they’ll get a deal for Celtic’s Kieran Tierney over the line
It was also announced on Monday that Rafa Benitez will leave St James’ Park following a failure to reach an agreement with owner Mike Ashley over a new contract, with the Spaniard’s existing deal set to end on June 30. “The only thing that I know is what I don’t want: I am quite pathological in the sense of I have to play to win,” Mourinho told The Coaches’ Voice.”Then, if I don’t win, then that’s my problem and the players and the club and the structure but I need a project where the feeling is I play to win.”If somebody gives me a wonderful 10-year contract and the objective of the team is to stay in the first half of the table and if you finish seventh, eighth or ninth, it’s perfect, then that’s not for me. That’s my nature.
“My next [position] is to fight to win”.
