Super Falcons could still make it to the FIFA Womenâ€™s World Cup Round of 16. As Argentina fought back from 2-0 down to draw 3-3 with Scotland. The result sees both teams elimanated from tournament.

Of the 4 slots available for best losers, China and Brazil took the first 2.

Now the calculation and permutation continues tomorrow. New Zealand vs Cameroon and Thailand vs Chile is now the only two games that can effect the reality of Germany vs Nigeria in the knockout series.

So Nigerians have the following prayer points; That New Zealand must hold Cameroon to a draw. And, Thailand should not lose by more than three goals to Chile.
