Carlos Rexach would rather see Barcelona bid for Neymar than Atletico Madrid’s want away forward Antoine Griezmann.

Though the 72-year-old admires the Frenchman’s ability, he believes that Neymar has proven himself to a higher level even despite the off-field issues that come with the Paris Saint-Germain ace.

“Neymar has the advantage,” Rexach said to COPE when asked to compare the Brazilian and French forwards.

“He’s skilful without space and searches for the ball deep. He’s complete, but Griezmann is coming of age.

“I don’t like these stories [surrounding Neymar]. He’s a good player and he should have a different profile.

“If you offered me Neymar or Griezmann, I’d take Neymar.”


Barcelona have been criticised despite being crowned as Spanish champions again and Rexach believes they’ve had a good season.

“If you win the league you’ve had a great season,” he said.

“A treble is the best scenario, but Barcelona have had a good season.

“But the two games at the end [Liverpool and Valencia] did a lot of damage.”

Naturally, fingers have been pointed at Ernesto Valverde, but the coach doesn’t deserve to be the main subject of criticism according to Rexach.

“It’s easy to look at the coach, but I’ve been there and in the ned it’s the players who win or lose,” he explained.

“The last Liverpool goal was complete confusion.

“If half of the team switch off, there’s nothing a coach can do.”

Barcelona have launched a controversial kit for the 2019/20 season, moving away from their traditional stripes.

“In life, everything changes,” he said. “Now you see Barcelona in yellow, in pink, in all colours.

“This is fashion, it’s a business. I like the classic design, but I’m a bit old now.”
