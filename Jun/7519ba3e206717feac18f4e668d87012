Barcelona star, Philippe Coutinho, has decided to join Chelsea, according to Mundo Deportivo.

Brazilian star is keen on filling the void left by Eden Hazard, who left Chelsea for Real Madrid.


Liverpool, Manchester United and PSG are also chasing the Brazilian star, who had admitted that he may not be at Barcelona next season.

The newspaper reports that the attacking midfielder would welcome the return to England and sees Chelsea as the “ideal destination” for him.

Chelsea are in search for a star man to replace Hazard.


However, the deal will depend on whether FIFA upturns Chelsea’s transfer ban.
