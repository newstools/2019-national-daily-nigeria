“I followed him immediately to his room and started talking to him but he could not respond and when I looked closely, I discovered that his teeth had tightened up.
“As I looked around, I saw an empty Sniper bottle; at this point I raised alarm and my other children rushed to the room and we tried to give him red oil but his tightened teeth did not allow the oil to enter his mouth,” she said.
According to her, he was rushed to the hospital, where he eventually died.
“We immediately rushed him to Faith Foundation Hospital, Nsukka and were later referred to Bishop Shanahan Hospital, Nsukka, where he eventually died.
The mother of seven said her son could have died of depression, noting that he had been lamenting his inability to graduate from UNN because of his final year project, which he has been working on.
“I know two things he usually complained, his inability to graduate from UNN since 2016 because of the project that he has not finished as his classmates have all gone for their National Youth Service Corps.
“Also, how his father’s family in Ihechiowa in Arochukwu Local Government of Abia State abandoned us since their father died.
“Whenever he complained of these things, I usually advised him to trust God, who is capable of solving every problem.
“I do not know why he will go to this extent of committing suicide. I have seven children and he was my first child.
“It is still like a dream to me that my first son and first child has died,” she said in tears.
