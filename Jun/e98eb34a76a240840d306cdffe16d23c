Apparently worried by the spate of killings in the country, former senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani has described as ironic the movement of armed foreign herdsmen into the country, when it is hard for dealers in foreign rice and vehicles to move their goods into the country through same borders.
 
Recall that the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration during his first term in office banned the importation of foreign rice as well as cars through land borders, a decision that is being strictly enforced by the Nigeria customs Service.
 
However, reports claim that there has been influx of foreign herdsmen and weapons through land borders, especially those in the northern part of the country.
 
Both President Buhari and some of his former ministers had at one point or the other claimed that herdsmen killing, destroying homes and farm lands as well as kidnapping and raping women across the country, chiefly in the North central, are foreigners.

In series of tweets on his handle on Monday, Sani wrote: “It’s ironic that through our Northern borders, it’s difficult for the foreign rice dealers and foreign vehicles dealers to penetrate but it’s easier for the ‘foreign Herdsmen’ and their arms to penetrate.”
 
In another tweet, the senator asked Nigerian Government to learn to give travel advisory warning to its citizens in foreign lands whenever there is crisis in countries of their abode and stop being angry when other countries warn their citizens against coming to Nigeria.
 
“When leaders present themselves as servants, the nation rallies around them for all problems to be solved; when leaders present themselves as infallible messiahs with the magic wand, the nation watches and expects them to solve all of its problems.
 
“We should equally learn to give travel advisory warning to our own citizens whenever there is crisis in other countries, rather than get angry whenever other countries warn their citizens against coming to our country in times of crisis or seeming danger,” he said.
