The Academic Staff of Union Universities has warned political leaders in Nigeria to put in place the right policies and enforce them to avoid revolution in the country.
National President of ASUU, Professor Biodun Ogunyemi who gave out the warning at a media conference after the union’s National Executive meeting in Port Harcourt, decried the state of the Nigerian economy.
He noted that the political and the ruling class have failed Nigerians in all sectors, emphasising that the Federal Government’s fight against corruption has lost its purpose.
The ASUU President also criticised the poor management of the Social Welfare scheme, adding that the political class should make the right policies and enforce them to avoid the revolution of the masses.
“There is need for us to sit down together and put pressure on the ruling class because as you can see, there is mass poverty but the number of private jets are increasing including churches and mosques. Over 70 per cent of our people cannot afford a 2-square meal. This is very worrisome.
“What belongs to the generality of Nigerians has been shared among a few people. We need to re-distribute wealth because those who take what belongs to the masses will not be able to enjoy their wealth because there may be a general uprising of the poor.
“It is in the interest of those who are ruling us to sit back and redesign a programme that will lead to genuine wealth distribution,” he said.
