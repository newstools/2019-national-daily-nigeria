Goncalo Guedes’ 60th minute  strike was enough to earn Portugal a 1-0 victory over Netherlands who can boast of a relatively water tight defence with one of the world’s most expensive defenders in Virgil Van Dijk at the Estadio do Dragao.
Portugal the host nation with one of the world’s best players in Cristiano Ronaldo had been touted as favourites ahead of the inaugural Finals and they lived up to that billing in Porto, adding more major silverware to their European Championship triumph three years ago.
The magical Ronaldo had netted a hat-trick in the 3-1 semi-final win over Switzerland  but he was kept relatively quiet on the 
 occasion of Finals  by Virgil van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt.
