Following reports that APC ex-govers that lost their second bid will automatically end up in President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet. A group has fingered one of such likely nominees for corruption.
It then warned Buhari not to take on any baggage.
The Coalition against Financial Crimes and Injustice (CFCI) said Bauchi’s former Gov Mohammed Abubakar has a reputation problem, and he is not fit to be a member of Buhari’s cabinet.
According to the chairman of the group, Bibi Dogo, by appointing people facing allegations of corruption, the image of the Buhari administration as being intolerant of corruption would be dented.
Dogo alleged that the ex-governor was a nemesis to the progress and development of Bauchi state when he ruled the state for four years without completing any single project despite the billions of naira he collected from the federation account.
“I served in the transition committee and it is on record that Governor Abubakar left Bauchi with over N137 billion debts,” he said‎.
“We are giving this advice because our organization believes in the administration of Buhari whose track record is fighting corruption, corrupt practices and entrenching truth, honesty and integrity.
“We advise that the President should appoint his cabinet in a manner that will ensure they do not become liabilities to the government or dent his impeccable image.”
Dogo also argued that by allowing the former governor to acquire afresh political power from the back door as minister, the Bauchi voters who rejected him for not performing may be disappointed.
