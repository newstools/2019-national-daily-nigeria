Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, on Saturday appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to negotiate with Boko Haram over the release of Leah Sharibu.

Sharibu was the only Christian girl among the 112 kidnapped from the school by Boko Haram members on February 19, 2018. Her continued captivity is her price for reportedly not accepting Islam.
While the others were later brought home, Sharibu was held back for reportedly refusing to denounce Christianity.

She marked 16 years in the hands of the insurgents and even though the government has continued to say it is committed to bringing her back, not much is heard of the efforts being made in that regard.

The Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), a breakaway faction of Boko Haram, has kept her in captivity since then, sparking public outrage.

The government, however, says it is committed to ensuring Leah returns home. Recently, Lai Mohammed, minister of information, denied rumours that the girl is dead.

However, while sharing a photograph of Buhari and his children, Omokri insisted that Leah’s father, Nathan Irmiya would also love to take a photograph with his daughter, hence the need for negotiation.
In a series of tweets on Saturday, the former presidential aide wrote: “Dear @MBuhari, Leah’s father, Nathan Irmiya Sharibu, also wants to take a picture like this with his daughter, Leah Sharibu.

“Please, I BEG on my KNEES, enter into negotiation with Boko Haram to #FreeLeahSharibu.

“Please join me in RETWEETING till Muhammadu Buhari sees this.”
