Nasiru Musa, 30, of Salka village in the Magama Local Government Area of the state has been arrested  by the Niger Police Command for allegedly strangling his seven months old daughter.
Musa was apprehended by police operatives attached to the Nasko Division following a tip-off.
According to reports, on May 20, 2019, took his deceased child to an uncompleted building, where he allegedly strangled the infant while her mother was asleep.
When the mother of the child woke up and could not find her child, she raised the alarm. Her neighbours then reported the matter to the police after an earlier search yielded no result.
Police investigation led to Musa’s arrest, and he late confessed to the crime during interrogation, according to state PPRO Muhammad Abubakar.
The late child was born before wedding—which the couple were preparing for as Musa killed the baby.
The suspect would be charged to court after the conclusion of investigation.
