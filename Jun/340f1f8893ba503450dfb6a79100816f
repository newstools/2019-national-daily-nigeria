A Fulani herdsman at Ilasa Ekiti beheaded a teenage Fulani girl for refusing to spend the Eld-el-Fitri holiday with him.
He was supposed to marry the girl at some point later because both of them were engaged according to Fulani tradition, but her parents slackened the agreement.
The intending husband was said to be a drunkard and drug addict, which might be the reason the girl’s parents had a rethink.
He attacked the girl on her way to fetch water from a stream on Tuesday, and cut off her head. Then he fled.
The Ekiti police command on Wednesday confirmed the incident, and stated the suspect had been arrested following information provided by the deceased’s younger sister who witnessed the murder.
According to Ajayi Omolagba, the traditional ruler of Ilasa, the suspect got angry on suspicion that his bride’s parents might no longer be interested in marrying her off to him by keeping her away from him during the Muslim celebration.
The police have started investigation into the murder, said PPRO Caleb Ikechukwu.
