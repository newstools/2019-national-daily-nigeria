The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is considering different options in handling issues relating to its lawmakers who went against the party’s position on the leadership of the National Assembly.
National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, made this known on Friday.
He recalled that the party had adopted Senators Ahmad Lawan and Ovie Omo-Agege as Senate President and Deputy Senate President as well as Hon Femi Gbajabiamila and Idris Wase as Speaker and Deputy Speaker respectively, asking party members not to work against them.
However, Senator Ali Ndume and Hon Umar Bago refused to step down from the race for Senate President and Speaker, respectively but lost the contest.

He said the National Working Committee will surely take a decision on the action of the duo, but it would be speculative for him to speak on the issue when the NWC was yet to meet.
“I don’t go into speculation. Asking me to tell you what the party planned to do is asking me to speculate. The National Working Committee will meet to take decisions of what next to do,” he said.
On the leadership of the party caucus in the National Assembly, Onilu said the party will meet very soon to come out with a proper arrangement for the position.
”You know the National Assembly has taken off and we need to move fast. So, we will meet very soon and when we take our decision, we will inform the public. We have been transparent so far in what we are doing and we will also be transparent in this,” he added.
