Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has taken the Buhari-led administration to the cleaners over the proposal to establish ‘Ruga’ cow settlements for herdsmen across the country.
He asked governors of the South West, the region he hails from, to reject allocating any land in the area for cattle ranching or colony, warning that history will never forgive anyone of them that will do that.
Fani-Kayode, who stated this in a tweet on his Twitter handle on Friday, wrote:
“No governor in SW (South West) should allocate any portion of our land for cattle ranching or colony. Our history will not forget and forgive anyone of them who does so. Our land is not available for Miyetti Allah, so they should find other place or other means of rearing their cattle
“First it was political sharia. Then islamist Boko Haram. Then terrorist Fulani herdsmen. And now Ruga cow settlements.
“Nigeria has become the biggest shithole on the African continent. We are like an open public toilet that has never been flushed. Everything about our country stinks!”
The former minister, who is an opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, has remained an ardent critic of President Muhammadu Buhari and his administration.
