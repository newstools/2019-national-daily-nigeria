It looks like Declan Rice will be playing his football at the London Stadium again this season.Rice, 20, has been the subject of interest from Manchester United and Manchester City after numerous top displays last year. But the midfielder appears to have committed himself to West Ham for another season. Asked if he planned to keep his current squad number, Rice responded: “Had loads of people asking this. I WILL be keeping 41 for this season.”
As for Neymar latest. PSG have offered Neymar to Manchester United in a proposed swap deal with Paul Pogba, claims talkSPORT presenter Andy Goldstein. “My understanding is that PSG said ‘we’ll take Pogba and give you Neymar’,” Goldstein said.“But United, if this is true, United backed out because Neymar’s wage demands were so preposterous. “Neymar to United, I would rather have Neymar than Pogba. Neymar at United! Do the deal, get it done. That’s the one, isn’t it? “Wouldn’t it be great to see him in the Premier League. Get the deal done. You’d make the money back in shirt sales in the first hour.” PSG have offered Neymar to Manchester United in a proposed swap deal with Paul Pogba
