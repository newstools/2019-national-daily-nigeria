The Majority Leader in the House of Representatives,Femi Gbajabiamila, has intensified last minute campaign for the Speaker of the House, taking his mobilization and appeals for support to notable political leaders who are not members of the House. Taking his appeal to southeast for support, Gbajabiamila visited former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, who subsequently, declared his endorsement of the House of Representatives Majority Leader for the Speaker of the Ninth National Assembly.
National Daily learned that Kalu hosted Gbajabiamila and a delegation from his campaign organization at his residence where he declared his endorsement and support for the House Majority Leader in the race for the Speaker.
Though, Kalu is influential, his Abia State is being controlled by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which may make his influence of Igbo lawmakers in the House of Representatives a little difficult to achieve. However, his identification with Gbajabiamila could still influence the lawmakers from Abia and other states in the south east when political calculations are taken to micro considerations of making a choice between two alternatives.
