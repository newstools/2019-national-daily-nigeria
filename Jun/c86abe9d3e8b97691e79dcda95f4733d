Since the APC national leader Bola Tinubu popped it in the open he was under pressure to run for presidency in 2023, there have been a lot of chin wags, mostly in the north, despising his statement.
But the quiet ambition just got a major amplification from his own southwest.
PDP’s former stalwart and head of a power bloc in Lagos politics has openly endorsed Tinubu, and expressed readiness to push him all the way when the time comes.
“Nothing in life is static. Tinubu is from the Southwest, and anything for the progress of Southwest, I’m for it,’ said former Minister Adeseye Ogunlewe in an interview with the Sun.
“Tinubu has paid his dues. If Tinubu wants to contest, let him contest, and let Nigerians decide his fate.
Ogunlewe described the APC leader as a dogged fighter who has triumphed over many challenges.
“He has seen it all. He can do it if given the chance,” he said.
Ogunlewe recently dumped the PDP for the ruling party, after years of opposition politics in Lagos.
He believes democracy should be open, and no geo-political restriction should deter anybody from contesting the 2023 presidency.
“To shut out some people or group is undemocratic,” he said.
“Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu wants to contest; let him contest.”
