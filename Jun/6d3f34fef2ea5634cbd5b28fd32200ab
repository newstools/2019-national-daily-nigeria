Sen. Danjuma Goje (APC-Gombe Central) on Thursday announced his withdrawal from the race for Senate Presidency. He also endorsed Sen. Ahmad Lawan(APC Yobe North) whom the party anointed.
The scale now tips towards Lawan who apparently has garnered favour even from opposition senators–while Goje and his supporters will be joining forces with the majority leader.
As the election holds June 11, the only APC’s senator challenging the party candidate and decision remains Ali Ndume.
He is expecting President Muhammadu Buhari to ask him to withdraw.
Goje and Lawan spoke with State House correspondents after a closed door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari alongside  Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters, Sen. Ita Enang, was present as Goje and  Lawan fielded questions from State House correspondents.
