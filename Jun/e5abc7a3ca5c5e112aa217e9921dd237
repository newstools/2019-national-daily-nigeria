President of Confederation of African Football (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad  has been arrested in Paris, France.
According to a @jeune_afrique, the CAF president was arrested on Thursday morning at a hotel in Paris, where he was staying to attend the FIFA Congress.
It’s unclear why the Magdagalsy was taken away by police but the last few days have been very controversial for the African football body he is in charge of.
National Daily learned that less than 24 hours ago CAF executive committee decided to order for a replay of the Second leg of the CAF Champions league final which ended prematurely last Friday in Tunis, Tunisia.
It was observed that the decision to replay the final has not gone down well with Esperance followers and many across the continent, including some top followers of Ahmad.
It’s unclear whether his arrest is directly linked to the Esperance Versus Wydad case but earlier this year there were issues of corruption and sexual harassment raised against the Football top Executive in Africa, especially by former CAF employees.
The next edition of the biggest football tournament in the continent, the African Nations Cup, begins in 15 days in Egypt and will need the football supremo of the continent for a smooth football festival.
