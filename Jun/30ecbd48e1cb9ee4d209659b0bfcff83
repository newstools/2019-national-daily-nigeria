Appointment: Buhari’s critic Festus Adedayo appointed, sacked immediately in APC govt
Senate President Ahmad Lawan has withdrawn the appointment of editor and columnist Festus Adedayo appointed as Lawan’sspecial adviser on media less than 48 hours ago.
Lawan backed off the decision as some supporters of the APC) protested against the appointment.
On Thursday morning, a group known as APC stakeholders, accused Lawan of rewarding Buhari’s enemies.
The spokesman of the group, Abu Andrew, said the appointments were “glaring” reward to people who have insulted Buhari as a person and as a president.
Buhari’s wife, too, objected to the appointment.
Aisha, tweeted the video of the group’s protest on her verified account.
“You cannot drive an agenda with people who don’t believe in that agenda…how will you achieve your purpose If you bring in people who fought against your agenda,” Aisha added.
Hours later, the Senate president did a second-guess, announced Adedayo’s name had been deleted
“The office of the President of the Senate has reviewed the appointment of Mr. Festus Adedayo as Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the President of the Senate and decided to rescind its decision on the appointment, and wishes Mr. Adebayo the best in his future endeavours,” Mohammed Isa, his media aide, said in a statement.
Adedayo writes a column on online platforms where he mostly whitewashes President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC government.
Many senior editors and columnists in Nigeria sometimes land jobs in the government after using their galled ink to paint the government black.
Reuben Abati became a media aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan whose goverment the former chairman of the Guardian had satirised in a long running serio-comic column on Friadays.
