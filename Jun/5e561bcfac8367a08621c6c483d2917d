Jigawa former Gov and PDP chieftain  Sule Lamido has accused all Yoruba leaders of abandoning the late M.K.O. Abiola in the 1993 election only for them to rally round him when he won—same way they treated former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
Lamido said this while reacting to the recognition of June 12 as Democracy Day by President Muhammad Buhari .
He said Buhari only declared June 12 as Democracy Day to make name.
According to Lamido, on June 11 all Yoruba leaders were in NRC because they saw Abiola as more of a  northerner, and they didn’t vote for him.
“It was like in 1999 when Yoruba leaders worked against Olusegun Obasanjo, they only embraced them as their own after they had won election,” Lamido stated.
He also stated the current APC leaders, including Buhari  and Bola Ahmad Tinubu worked against the June 12.
“No one among all the APC leaders worked for the June 12, only the current Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who was then an Social Democratic Party SDP chairman in Adamawa state,” he said.
“There is no way a broker of democracy can work for democracy,” Lamido noted.
Lamido accused Buhari of being an enemy of democracy.
“It was Buhari that toppled the democratic elected government under Shehu Shagari.”
