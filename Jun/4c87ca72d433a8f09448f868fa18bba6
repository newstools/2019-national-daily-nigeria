The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been thrown into renewed tension over reports of the resignation of the Director of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Chidi Nwafor. The report had raised new questions over the server controversy which INEC has been struggling to make a clear position at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal in Abuja.
INEC, however, at the weekend, debunked reports that the ICT Director has resigned from the service of the commission.
The commission had on its official twitter handle @inecnigeria, at the weekend, indicated that the rumour as false, appealing to members of the public to disregard the reports.
“The rumour circulating that our Director ICT, Engr. Chidi Nwafor has resigned is totally false and should be disregarded.
“The Director and another staff have just returned from South Africa where they represented INEC at the high level 5th Annual Meeting of ID4Africa Movement in Johannesburg (from June 18 to June 20).
“Neither he nor any senior staff has resigned his appointment or indicated such intention, since the elections,” INEC had twitted.
