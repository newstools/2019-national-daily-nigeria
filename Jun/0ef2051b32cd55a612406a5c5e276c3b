She allegedly confessed to cooking food with water used to wash dead bodies. Also, she mixed such water with fluids and menstrual blood off her private part.

She said she did all these to attract customers whose “destinies” she used for the growth of her business and riches.

She continued saying all sort of atrocities as she ran around town naked and mad. The news of her confession spread around the area, and some of her customers (including Okada men) and angry onlookers descended on her and gave her the beating of her life, before Police men intervened and took her away.
