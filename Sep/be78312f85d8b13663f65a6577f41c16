Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone refused to speak on rumours linking his side to Inter star Mauro Icardi.
“I always say the same. I can’t really speak about players that are not here. Obviously, I only speak about players that we have.”
The Argentine forward has been looking for a way out of the Serie A club, with the Spanish side seeming like a reasonable option.
You should also know that KIlmarnock defender Greg Taylor has taken a medical at Celtic ahead of a move to Parkhead.
The left-back has been brought to the Scottish champions to help replace Kieran Tierney.
The Daily Record says Jack Hendry and Calvin Miller will head the other way in a deal the paper calls “hastily worked”.
