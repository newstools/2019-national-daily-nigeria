Some traders at the Computer Village, Ikeja, Lagos, have decried low internet activities as a  result of the suspension of the Google free WiFi.
The traders, in separate interviews with newsmen said that the disconnection had slowed down internet activities at the market.
Mr Adeniyi Ojikutu, president, Computer and Allied Products Dealers Association of Nigeria (CAPDAN) said that the users in the hub were informed about the Google free WiFi suspension when they were already used to it.
Ojikutu said that the free internet users were told by Google that there were issues with their service provider, which was being looked into, to be rectified soon.
“The disconnection is affecting people and they are not happy.
“Google and the traders are affected by the disconnection, because there will be few people using the search engine.
“The dealers at the hub are using the internet for research and to get the prices of products online as well as using it for other activities.
“All these are slowed down due to the suspension of the free Google WiFi,’’ Ojikutu said.
Miss Chioma Ogugwua, a programmer and software developer, said that the internet connectivity at the Computer Village was not so effective due to the disconnection.
Ogugwua noted that there were so many activities on the available network at the hub and the traffic was much, thereby slowing down connectivity.
According to her, computer village is a place where there are so much internet activities. So, suspending the free WiFi can be disturbing, especially when people were getting used to it.
Meanwhile, Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google spokesman, when contacted, apologised that the Google free WiFi could not be accessed.
“We apologise that Google station cannot be accessed at the Computer Village in Lagos, at this time.
“We are working on it and will bring them back as soon as possible, ‘’ Kola-Ogunlade said.
