The former Super Eagles player and national Coach of the Super Eagles, Samson Siasia, has been battling for the freedom of his mother who was kidnapped a second time after her freedom was secured from the previous abduction. A veteran sports writer, Mitchel Obi, has stated that Siasia needs help to secure the release of his mother from the kidnappers.
He explained that while struggling to secure the mother’s freedom, Siasia has expended the resources available to him while also battling to clear his name and unchain himself from the FIFA ban which hit him unexpectedly last month.
Obi said that Siasia has sent his appeal to the Court of Arbitration For Sports (CAS) in Switzerland, asking the court to stop the FIFA decision until his appeal is heard.
“This is a fight to finish for a man who loves to attack both as a celebrated player of the Eagles and a coach.
“We can only pray that Samson’s appeal hit the right notes and he finally gets the fair hearing which never was, particularly, in a case for which he is being punished simply on ‘motivated decision,” Mitchel Obi said.
