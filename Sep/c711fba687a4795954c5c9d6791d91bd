The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23, 2019 presidential election, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday lamented the national loss of a foremost Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Sir Joseph Ufot Ekaete, who passed away recently at age 80.
Atiku in a statement in Abuja eulogized the deceased SGF as “a loyal and patriotic Nigerian, a meticulous technocrat and trustworthy public servant, who truly served his country to the best of his talent and ability.”
“As Obong from Onna Local Government Area and being the first Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom, Chief Ekaete has served Nigeria in diverse roles, and we will all dearly miss the passion and integrity which he brought to every responsibility at his charge. His footprint shall remain indelible in the sands of time.
“He was a quiet and modest achiever. He was one of the big brains behind the monetization programme of the Obasanjo administration. He also streamlined and harmonized the activities of several sectors of government from ministerial schedules to Federal Executive Council memos.
“In fact, as SGF Chief Ekaete was the unassuming and loyal clearing house for the Federal Government between 1999 and 2007.  He was a fine gentleman, great political ally and an ever willing team player,” Atiku declared.
While commiserating with the family of the deceased, and praying for the repose of the soul of the departed national scribe, Atiku said Nigeria will sorely miss the erudite services and wise counsels of Chief Ekaete; who was a Knight of the Anglican Communion, an illustrious son of Akwa Ibom State and a dedicated and responsible family man.
