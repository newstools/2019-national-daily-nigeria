Kwara State Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) has applauded the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, and the State President, Honour Sirawoo, for their intervention, which has ensured that journalists will cover the 5th National Youth Games (NYG) without hitches.
The chapter had cried out following continuous non-provision of conducive environment for sports journalists in successive editions of the NYG.
The protest of the Kwara chapter attracted the attention of the Minister and the SWAN President, who swung into action, thereby, ensuring that for the first time in the history of Games in Ilorin, sports journalists will have a media centre, shuttle bus and seamless accreditation process.
Secretary of the association, Olayinka Owolewa, disclosed this  in Ilorin after the Minister assured that demands by SWAN will be met to avoid a possible boycott of this year’s edition.
Consequently a media centre is now in place for journalists, which has been inspected by the executive of the association in Kwara; while the shuttle bus that will convey journalists around event venues will arrive soon.
Owolewa acknowledged the quick intervention of the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, pledging to ensure a smooth run for journalists coming to Ilorin for the games.
The Kwara SWAN Scribe said the Minister has demonstrated he is a true and worthy ambassador of the pen profession with his quick intervention and responses.
