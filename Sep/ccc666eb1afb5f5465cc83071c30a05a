Nemanja Matic has risked the wrath of his boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer by liking an Instagram post slamming the his manager.
The Red Devils midfielder has not been included in the starting line-up for any of United’s opening Premier League fixtures.
He was on the bench for his sides 1-1 draw in their latest match against 10-man Southampton on Saturday, coming on for just over 20 minutes of the tie.
 
National Daily findings have it that Matic’s future has been under the spotlight after he demanded showdown discussion with Solskjaer over his role in the team. And it now looks to have been placed further in doubt after his social media faux pas.
A comment from an Instagram user said: “Matic if #Ole Gunnar Solskjaer don’t want to future you in his team please leave the team I think that man is sp (sic) myopic that he doesn’t know he needs you in the midfield, I am beginning to hate Ole.”
The 31-year-old has been ousted from his central midfield role by Scott McTominay and has not started a game for his club since the beginning of May.
Even the departures of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini have not increased the Serbian’s importance in the team as Solskjaer looks to develop his younger prospects.
Matic has been linked with a move away from United, with a number of clubs monitoring his situation and weighing up a bid to take him on loan.
However it is unlikely that Solskjaer will allow him to leave the club on a temporary basis without being able to sign a replacement as he sees Matic as a solid back-up from the bench.
He came on with the scores tied at 1-1 at St Marys, with Southampton reduced to 10 men just moments later.
But United were unable to get a winner, leaving them with just four points out of a possible 12 in their opening four games.
