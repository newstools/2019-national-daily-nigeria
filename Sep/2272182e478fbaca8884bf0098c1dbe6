The Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has protested what it considered drama of injustice at the Edo State Election Petitions Tribunal, raised alarm before the general public and lovers of democracy over the unwarranted delay in the release of the Certified True Copy of the Enrolled Order of Judgement delivered by The Tribunal on September 8, 2019 in the  petition of Hon Omosede Igbinedion Vs INEC, Dennis Idahosa and APC in the House of Representatives election held on 23, February 2019.
“The tribunal read and passed its Judgement 10 days ago and it was the first to be delivered.
“It is a known fact that parties are allowed by law to go on appeal
within 21 days of judgement. But our right of appeal is being frustrated by the deliberate delay to avail us with copies of the judgement to enable us file our appeal within time.
“We are informed that APC leaders have boasted that by the time we get certified copies of the judgement, our lawyers will not have time to file any appeal. They have admitted in certain quarters that they may lose at appeal even though they know that the tribunal tried in its five-hour long judgment to justify its position,” PDP declared.

Edo PDP, therefore, called on the tribunal to immediately do the needful as it is common knowledge that copies of judgement passed several days after the Omosede Igbinedion petition have been made available to the parties involved.
“The tribunal will be doing itself a great disservice if they allow APC to create the impression that in this particular case, they are taking instructions from “outside”, PDP declared in a statement by Chris Osa Nehikhare, State Publicity Secretary.
