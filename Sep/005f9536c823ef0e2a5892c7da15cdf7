Straight off the success of his last single, Rudeboy is back with a brand new single titled, “Audio money”.

In “Audio Money” the singer whose real name is Paul Okoye cautions his audience on the pretentious lifestyle exhibited by users of the popular social networking site, Instagram.

Quotable lyrics:

“Everybody rich for Instagram…

Living fake live with cheap data…

…the money nah just audio”

“Audio Money” is the follow-up track to the critically acclaimed “Reason With Me”, which received massive airplay and topped charts across the country. The song was produced by Lord Sky.

Rudeboy also known as King Rudy was the second half of the now-defunct legendary group P-Square. Rudeboy branched out to start a solo career in 2017.

Some critics have, in recent times, blasted the musician for his delay in putting a word against Xenophibia.

The critics are of the opinion that he delayed because of the endorsement deal he has with MTN.
