The PDP has alleged conspiracy in the delay by the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal to release the record of its judgment to enable the party and its presidential candidate file an appeal at the Supreme Court.
The party said the delay was a calculated attempt to frustrate its plan to appeal at the Supreme Court.
“It is instructive to state that the Court of Appeal is aware that our party and candidate have mandatory 14 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, yet it is delaying in releasing a judgment that was read for nine hours and which it wants the public to believe it actually wrote,’ said PDP’s national publicity secretary Kola Ologbondiyan in a press release Friday.
“Our party fears that this development is lending credence to suspicion in the public space that the judgment is being tampered with and altered, in the name of correcting errors, knowing that there is no way the verdicts can stand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court.”
Accordig to him, the PDP hopes there is no link between the circumstances surrounding this delay and the boasts by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and his chairman Adams Oshiomhole that justice will not be served to the PDP and its candidate Atiku Abubakar.
The party also claimed that it had the full video and audio recording of the judgment and we would not hesitate to expose any underhand act by anybody.
