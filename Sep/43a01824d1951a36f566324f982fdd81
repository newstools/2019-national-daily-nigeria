Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Federal High Court might have tied himself up in a knot b ordering the DSS to release detained Omoyele Sowore, a media activist and convener of RevolutionNow Protest in custody since August.
Reason: Aso Rock is angry—and shocked.
Sources said the presidency is worried that a justice could order the bail of an alleged treasonable felon.
“A report has been prepared to report Justice Taiwo to NJC in view of the fact that, as far as this country, it is known that a person charged with treasonable felony has no bail option,” the Nation quoted a source.
The report also stated security and intelligence community in the country is shocked by the judgement. Which is why the DSS is still holding to Sowore, despite the court order, and efforts of Sowore’s lawyers to serve the DSS boss Yusuf Bichi a notice of compliance. 
The judgement will soon be appealed; and the NJC will be petitioned about the conduct and abuse of power by the judge.
Since President Muhammdu Buhari came to office in 2015, suspects of treason held by the DSS have had the misfortune of having to live in detention in spite of curt orders granting them bail.
IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu had to do a bush parole to escape after getting bail on health grounds; Shiites leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky is still in detention though he got bail to travel for medical attention whose arrangement crumbled; and ex-NSA Dasuki Sambo has been caged for over four years now.
