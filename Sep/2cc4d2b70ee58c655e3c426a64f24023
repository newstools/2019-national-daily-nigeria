The Maiduguri Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Thursday, September 26, 2019 arraigned one Adam Kaka Adam before Justice Ibrahim Jauro of the Yobe State High Court,  Damaturu, on one-count charge, bordering on criminal misappropriation to the tune of N11, 657, 500.00 (Eleven Million Six Hundred and Fifty-seven Thousand Five Hundred Naira).

The Commission disclosed in a statement published on its website on Thursday.

EFCC stated that Adam was a former Service Manager, in charge of Vault Room and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in Unity Bank Plc, Damaturu Branch, Yobe State.

The defendant, the statement disclosed, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Following his plea, prosecution counsel Khalid Sanusi prayed the court for a trial date and for the defendant to be remanded in prison custody.
