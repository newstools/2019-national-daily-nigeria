The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Godfrey Onyeama has debunked claims circulating in the social media that Nigerians were killed in the recent xenophobic attack in South Africa.
Addressing State House correspondents in Abuja after a closed door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, Onyeama said confirmed that premises, shops of Nigerians have been looted and property destroyed but no Nigerian was killed during the crisis.
“So, number one is that the information we have from the High Commission, from the Consul General in South Africa is that no Nigerian life has been lost during this crisis.
“And I think that is very important because on social media, there is a lot of stories going around of Nigerians being killed, jumping off buildings and being burnt. This is not the case.
“What we know is that premises, shops of Nigerians have been looted and property destroyed,’’ he said.
He, however said a red line has been drawn between Nigeria and South Africa over the lingering attacks, noting that African countries have built consensus against the attacks.
“The South African government has to assume its responsibilities and protect Nigerians in South Africa and we have to hold them to account and they have to do that as well as pay full compensation,’’ he added.
The minister confirmed that the Ambassador of Nigeria to South Africa would soon be recalled for consultation, adding “Enough is enough – we are going to address it once and for all this time. This is the position of government.’’
