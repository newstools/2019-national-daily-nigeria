Film star, Kate Henshaw, got on the wrong side of some Nigerians after she reacted to the xenophobic attacks against foreigners in South Africa. According to Kate, Nigerians are responsible for how people treat them. Many Twitter users did not find her comment appealing and they took to calling her out on the microblogging site
The Nigerian media has been rent with news of South Africans attacking foreigners in their country and the attacks have now escalated to them killing and maiming people as well as looting their shops and destroying their properties.
As is the custom with Nigerian celebs, they have taken to social media to react to the news. While some of them have openly condemned the attacks, others have tried to rationalise it by giving a reason for the attacks.
Nollywood actress, Kate Henshawâ€™s reaction to the news has raised serious backlash from Nigerians who do not agree with her.
Nigerians also saw their musician, 2baba, berated socialite Hushpuppi for calling out celebrities over their silence on the xenophobic attacks against foreigners in South Africa.
Hushpuppi had accused other celebs of not having any concern about the innocent lives that are being taken but would rather present themselves in the middle of less relevant issues.
2baba then noted that the post by Hushpuppi was totally uncalled. He commended him for joining the outrage, but pointed out that celebrities are not the real problem.
