National Daily gathered that Real Madrid are reportedly closing in on the £64million signing of Sporting Lisbon star Bruno Fernandes before the transfer window deadline.
Manchester United and Tottenham had both shown an interest in the midfielder earlier this summer.
However, the La Liga giants are poised to capture his signature before the Spanish transfer window closes on Monday night.
It comes as a timely boost for Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, whose side have made a stuttering start to the season after just one win in three games.
Fernandes, 24, recently opened up about a move to Premier League Tottenham that was blocked by the club.
Fernandes revealed that he got “everything right” for the move to go through but the north Londoners failed to meet Sporting’s €70million valuation.
“I never made any big demands, my manager was always dealing with the financials.
“It was and is my goal to play in England, Sporting you know that, everyone knows that, and there were conditions for things to be done.
“Having a dream of playing in England did not prevent continuity at Sporting. Sporting made the decision not sell me also because they believed in my worth and for believe that the values that were offered were not enough.
“I have to be flattered that Sporting does not accept values that for them are low and for me it has to be proud of the club to think I’m worth more.”
