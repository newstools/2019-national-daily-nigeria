The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) may have declared total war on Igbo leaders, particularly, the south east governors and leaders of Ohaneze Ndigbo. IPOB members in diaspora were said to have placed at alert to attack any Igbo leader that crosses the shores of Nigeria into Europe and America.
IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, had also warned Igbo leaders that it is too late for any of them to defend their inaction(s) when the Nigerian Army invaded the southeast on military operations in which many IPOB members were killed.
The new threats were the result of the meeting of southeast governors on August 31, with some Igbo leaders, stakeholders, security officials, after which the Igbo leaders dissociated themselves from being behind the killing of Biafrans and invasion of the residence of Nnamdi Kanu in Afara-Uku, Ibeku, Abia State. About 28 loyalists of Kanu were alleged to killed in the operations.
National Daily learned that an IPOB leader in a statement protested that when the northern leaders were instigating them (S’East Governors) to fight and kill IPOB members, they were busy negotiating with their fellow Fulani bandits. He challenged southeast governors on the proscription of IPOB in Igbo land when the Army were about to invade their land under the guise of Operation Python Dance.
“If you knew nothing about Operation Python Dance 2, why did you proscribe IPOB in its wake, the IPOB leader asked.
Also IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, declared that it’s too little, too late for any explanation or defence.
It was gathered that Kanu in a statement on the social media declared:
“SE Govs, if you knew nothing about Operation Python Dance 2, why did you proscribe IPOB in its wake? The same northern leaders instigating you to fight peaceful IPOB is busy negotiating with and financing their fellow Fulani bandits. Who is fooling who? Too little, too late.”
