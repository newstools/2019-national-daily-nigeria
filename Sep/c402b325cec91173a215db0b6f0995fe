As the PDP fights a losing battles in its effort to reclaim what it calls a stolen mandate from the ruling APC, the party is also wrestling with the hard-headedness  of some of its members it cant control.
Rivers Gov. Nyesom just congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari for defeating the PDP candidate Atiku Abubakar at the election tribunal. He also threatened to expose his party he described as corrupt.
While that is raging, loser Dino Melaye in the Kogi guber primary rejected, flat out, his party appointing him as the director-general of the PDP guber campaign in Kogi’s coming election.
The Kogi west senator came fourth–last–in the contest whose winner, Musa Wada, is an upstart in Kogi politics.
The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan had, on Friday, told journalists about Melaye’s appointment.
But Melaye, via his Twitter handle @dino-melaye, and his Facebook wall,  stated his bald rejection of the responsibility.
“Let me state categorically that I have turned down the position of the Director-General of the Kogi State Governorship Campaign Council,” he wrote.
“I wish PDP all the best. When truth is a casualty, there is chaos.”
Melaye is a drop-in in the PDP–just about two years old in the party he once dumped.
He has not yet stated he is ready to hop out again.
