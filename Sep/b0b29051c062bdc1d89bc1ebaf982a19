Having won his APC guber ticket for the coming election, Kogi Gov. Yahaya Bello is ready to crush his enemies, especially his deputy Simon Achuba who as been in a war of attrition with his boss.
To start with, the governor has dumped the deputy for his chief of staff.
Edward Onoja is now Bello’s  running mate for the November 16 governorship election
Bello submitted Onoja’s name to the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), during his trip to Abuja last week.
Speculations had run wild in the runup to the primary election, mostly against the governor and his chances.
But Bello eventually secured over 90 percent of the delegates’ votes.
