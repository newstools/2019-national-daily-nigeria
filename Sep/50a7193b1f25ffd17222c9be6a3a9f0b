Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu, jas insisted that Vincent Enyeama must prove his class to be considered for a place in the national team.
Enyeama, who has been out for over two years, hinted on his return to the national team, saying that he still has the desire to play for the country.
“He made a decision that he needed a break, wanting to relax with his family.
“And if he decides to come back, it is a good one; after all, it is no crime playing for one’s fatherland. But there is the need to look at performance because football is all about performance, and that is what Enyeama must show,” said Alloy Agu.
