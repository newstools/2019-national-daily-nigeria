After sacking his chief press secretary who issued a statement criticizing RUGA policy, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Thursday, warned that he would sack any appointee who criticises President Muhammadu Buhari.
His Special Assistant on New Media, Mr. Francis Nwaze, made this known on Thursday.
“Doing such to any government or any Governor in this country has no value to add to his administration,’ said Nwaze in the statement.
“The Governor has advised that anyone who wishes to throw unnecessary stone against any of the above mentioned leaders, should, in his or her own best interest, get ready to leave his government as such will attract immediate sack.
“Any posting, henceforth against the President, any Governor or government from any of his appointees will attract immediate termination of appointment by him.
“If you want to castigate the President, his government or any Governor, you must leave Governor Umahi government first.”
The Nigerian constitution provides for freedom of expression–to offer opinions on any issues of national interest.
Besides, Umahi’s party is in the opposition at the federal level, and so it is expected to always criticise Buhari and the APC government.
