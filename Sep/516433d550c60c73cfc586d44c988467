The Online Publisher Association of Nigeria (OPAN) has urged the Nigeria police and the federal government to drop all outrageous charges against Agba Jalingo, a journalist and Publisher of Calabar-based news website, CrossRiverWatch and release him from detention immediately.
OPAN in a statement by the President, Austyn Ogannah, and the General Secretary, Daniel Elombah,
Demanded elected officials to stop using security officials and misapplying state laws to harass and intimidate journalists, activists and critics of government.
They narrated that on the police in Cross River State on August 30 charged Jalingo with disturbance of public peace and treason for his writings and social media posts about the controversial Cross River Governor, Mr. Benedict Ayade.
It was indicated that the Police arrested Jalingo in Lagos on August 22, 2019; and subsequently, charged him with two counts of terrorism, stemming from his alleged plans to work with Omoyele Sowore, “cult members,” and a local prince to “commit acts of terrorism” to remove Ayade from office, according to the charge sheet.
“To equate published criticism of government, policies and politicians with treason is absurd, draconian and outrageous.
“Authorities MUST release Agba Jalingo and other journalists, who are currently in state custody for speaking truth to power and demanding accountability from public office holders, immediately and unconditionally,” OPAN protested.
