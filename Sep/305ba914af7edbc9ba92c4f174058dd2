The incessant attack on businesses linked to South African investors in the expression of anger over the xenophobia attack and burning of Nigerians and other Africans in South Africa, continued on Wednesday in several parts of Nigeria. Angry Nigerians stormed Bode Thomas in Surulere, Lagos State,where they burnt the Bode Thomas, MTN customer care centre.
Shoprite facilities at different locations from Lagos to Akwa Ibom, Abuja and others, were also set ablaze by angry Nigerians.
They were reported to have continued to the South African owned cable TV, DSTV, to burn it but were kept off by the Nigerian Police, whose station is directly beside the DSTV office.
The UN has, however, appealed for the curtailing of the rising violence in Nigeria over the xenophobia killings in South Africa.
