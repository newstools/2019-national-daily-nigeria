The Commissioner for Youth and Sports in Oyo State, Seun Fakorede, visiting the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) permanent orientation camp in Iseyin, promised to improve the facilities after inspection of the camp.
The commissioner inspected the hostels, kitchen and toilets.
The NYSC Coordinator in Oyo State, Mrs. Eniola Ambekemo, commended the Commissioner for his intentions at giving the best to the youths.
Mrs. Ambekemo demanding the provision of ultramodern hall as one of the major needs for youth corps members in the state, appealed for the state government’s support.
Fakorede explained that the essence of the visit and facility tour at the NYSC orientation camp was to provide the state government first hand information on the standards of the facilities so as to know what intervention the government could make to upgrade the camp and make it conducive to the NYSC members and staff.
Fakorede assured that the state government would work with NYSC State Coordinator to ensure that the orientation camp gets a face lift.
He urged NYSC members to always strive to contribute their quota to national development during the service year.
