PDP’s operative Timi Frank is being deserted gradually as a media house, which first published his allegation of N90bn against the FIRS and V.P Yemi Osinbajo, cops out, and discredits Frank.
The Vanguard, in response to Osinbajo’s legal threat, apologized and promised to pull the story.
“We have since discovered that the story lacks factual substance and we hereby retract it in its entirety,” the newspaper stated in its public apology, adding it regrets any inconvenience the story might have caused the V.P. and the FIRS.
“We hold Professor Osinbajo, SAN in the highest esteem.”
Frank, a frustrated former deputy publicity of the ruling party, hopped into the PDP last year. He has since started a barrage of allegations many consider wild and unfounded to play his opposition politics.
Osinbajo has vowed to waiver his immunity in order for a thorough adjudication of Franks allegation he got N90bn from FIRS to fund party campaign in the last election. The FIRS also gave Frank 24 hours on Tuesday to retract or face legal action
The Bayelsa politician has dared the vice president to go ahead and sue him.
The PDP has yet to take position on the matter, leaving its activist who likes to issue press statement more than the party itself, to carry his cross for now.
To prove his point, Osinbajo has also fired off a letter to Google, demanding the removal of a You Tube video by Root TV or face legal action.
Another armchair analyst Katch Ononunu claimed the vice president is using federal government’s agencies under him to stack funds for his succession campaign in 2023.
Ononunu is included in the legal threat by the vice president.
