Bayelsa State House of Assembly  is in disarray as two speakers from within the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) emerged. 
The mace has been taking away by thugs.
The former speaker, Hon. Tonye Isenah, had on Friday afternoon, hinted on his resignation, claiming it was due to pressure mounted on him by some People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leaders to quit his position ahead of the November 16th governorship election.
He was summarily impeached on Monday, and another Speaker, Hon. Monday Obolo, was nominated in his place.
The current Speaker called the house to order Monday morning, and then adjourned the session indefinitely.
Armed groups belonging to the two speakers eventually descended on the chamber, shooting in the air and vandalising furniture before police officers were dispatched to contain the violence.
Isenah insisted his impeachment was illegal.
