Kogi Sen. Dino Melaye is caught between a rock and a hard place in the crisis beleaguering his political career.
First, he’s having a bad rival in the APC candidate Smart Adeyemi over the last NASS election which the election petition tribunal has nullified, and ordered a re-run.
Again, Melaye, in another contest that tested his popularity, lost woefully to a Johnny-come-lately Musa Wada, coming a distant fourth with less than a hundred votes, in the PDP primary for the coming guber election in Kogi.
Piling up the agony, the PDP headquarters then employed the bitter loser to co-ordinate Wada’s campaign. He rejected it in an angry tenor that left no doubt about his frustration with how much of a bad joke the PDP has become.
“When truth is a casualty, there is chaos,” he tweeted last Friday while  rejecting the appointment.
“Let me state categorically that I have turned down the position of the Director-General of the Kogi State Governorship Campaign Council.
“I wish PDP all the best.”
With this, many naturally concluded the mouthy senator is ready to roll–out of the PDP back into the APC  he left two years ago.
He has, however, denied this.
“Only compound fools and people with degree in stupidity will leave PDP for APC. APC will be defeated in Kogi State,” Melaye tweeted.
While he might be wrong, he has a point.
He’s battling a string of court cases with the APC government over allegations  of gun-running, attempting suicide, escaping from lawful custody when the police bundled him like a cargo for arraignment in a Kogi court last year.
Only a foolish Melaye will want to leave a party in chaos for another at war with him.
