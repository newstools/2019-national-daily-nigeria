Report reaching National Daily has it that Jamie Carragher has hit out at Ed Woodward’s running of Manchester United and has accused owners The Glazers of not caring about results.

The Red Devils have been in the process of hiring a director of football for some time now but are yet to offer anyone the position.
The candidates for the job include former players: Rio Ferdinand, Edwin van der Sar and Patrice Evra – all big names but men who are inexperienced for such an important role.
Former Liverpool centre-back Carragher says that in Woodward apparently opting to overlook sensible candidates shows he cares more about “image over substance”.
He adds that The Glazers tolerating this approach from the executive vice-chairman suggests they do not care about Manchester United’s result on the pitch, as long as the club continues to make money.

Carragher wrote in The Telegraph: “Most recently we have witnessed Woodward acting like a United superfan, apparently meeting a series of club legends who might take on the position of sporting director.
“The Glazers do not care because United are making money regardless of what is happening on the pitch.
“In such a world, a pitiful defeat at West Ham – the most important event in the week for die-hard United – can be bracketed as a ‘short-term distraction’ by their chief executive.”
