One of the Housemates in the Big Brother Naija (BBN) show, Tacha, who was disqualified at the weekend for misconduct and assault of co-housemate, Mercy, may have reportedly been rewarded with N80 million by Senator Dino Melaye and a group, Jaruma Empire. They were said to have made the N80 offer to Tacha less than 24 hours she was eliminated from the BBN and has remained subject of pubic opprobrium over her intolerable misconduct that led her disqualification.
Before the Friday outburst, Tacha had developed a reputation for arrogance, rude, pride, isolation and solitary behaviours which created disgusting perception from people watching the programme across the country.
In her unmitigated outburst, she made vulgar statements including despising her fellow housemate that she doesn’t need anybody in the show which she anticipated to win.
 The N80 million offer by Senator Melaye and Jaruma Empire seemingly run contrary to popular opinions, essentially on the social media, which appear to condemn Tacha as bad ambassador of Nigerian youths.  The N80 million is N20 million higher than the star prize of N60 million in the BBN show.
