The Coalition for Revolution (CORE) has lamented that Nigerians’ right to freedom of speech and protest are no longer guaranteed in the country.
The co-convener of CORE, Olaseni Ajayi, stated this on Wednesday, while lamenting the detention of Omoyele Sowore, Agba Jalingo and Abayomi Olawale, among others.
According to Ajayi, the personnel of the Lagos State Police Command had been deployed to frustrate the organisation’s plan to peacefully protest against the detention of the activists.
Ajayi added that the command’s personnel were also spotted at the national office of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights at Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja, and at the Gani Fawehimi Park, among other locations.
He said: “This morning, the police and other security forces invaded the national office of the CDHR and SaharaReporters offices, in another desperate attempt to forcefully stop planned peaceful agitation against the detention of activists without trial scheduled to start by 11:00 a.m. this morning.
“The right to speech, associate, protest and even to think are no more guaranteed under this neo- regime.
“However, our agitation for the immediate release of Omoyele Sowore, Agba Jalingo, Abayomi Olawale (Mandate) and all others currently being held in Buhari detention centres, and for the revolutionary transformation of the country continues.”
