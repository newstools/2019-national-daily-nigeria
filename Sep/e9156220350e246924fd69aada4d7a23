President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday shocked Festus Keyamo SAN, Minister of State in the Ministry of Niger Delta, with sudden redeployment to another ministry with elevation of his status as a junior minister in his cabinet.
Keyamo was redeployed through a letter by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, dated 23rd September, 2019, from the Niger Delta Ministry to the Federal ministry of Labour and Employment with effect from September 24 on the same status of Minister of State.
The redeployment letter from the SGF reads in part: “I write to convey to you the approval of His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, for your redeployment from the Ministry of Niger Delta to the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, as Minister of State with effect from Tuesday, September 24, 2019.”
No explanation was given for the redeployment Keyamo by President Buhari.
Keyamo was Director of Strategic Communication of the Buhari Presidential Campaign Organization during the 2019 general elections.
On nominations of ministers, there were expectations that Keyamo was going to be given the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice. This expectation also reflected when the ministerial nominees went for screening and confirmation in the Senate.
At inauguration of the Federal Executive Council on August 21, 2019, President Buhari assigned Keyamo to Niger Delta ministry as Minister of State.
