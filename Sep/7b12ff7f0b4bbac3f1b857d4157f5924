The promising Nigerian 17-year-old footballer, Miguel Azeez, who started playing football at the age of five years has progressed through the academy ranks.

His impressive work ethic has helped him to secure a professional contract.
Azeez made eight appearances during the under-18sâ€™ title-winning 2018/19 season, scoring twice and assisting twice.
He already has one goal in five Under-18 Premier League appearances this season and made his debut for the U-23 against Derby in Premier League 2 in August.
Azeez, who is also eligible to represent Spain internationally, was part of the Young Lions squad to the 2019 U-17 EURO.
