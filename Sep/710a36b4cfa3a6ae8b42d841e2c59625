After coming a distant fourth behind a JJC in stte-wide politics, Kogi West Sen. Dino Melaye is crying foul now, discrediting the outcome of the PDP primary in the north-central state.
Musa Wada, younger rother of another contestant and former Gov. Idris Wada polled 748 to defeat others in te election disrupted during counting on Wednesday.
The older Wada came third, while Melaye came fourth.
On his Twitter page, the bad loser said,  “It is ridiculous to declare a final result of PDP governorship primary election in Kogi State when my votes sorted out yesterday in 8 out of 10 ballot boxes are missing.
“Only to declare votes in 2 out of 10 ballot boxes as my votes. Totally unacceptable. Senator Dino Melaye.”
If he chose to contest result, the senator will be adding to his already heavy burden.
While the Nigerian police is fighting him court for his dramatic obstruction of justice last year when he was arrested for gun-related allegations, his APC rival in the last NASS election, Smart Adeyemi, is also thrashing him at the election tribunal.
