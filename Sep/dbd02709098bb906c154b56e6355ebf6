A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to the Presidential Election Tribunal ruling that dismissed the petition of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its candidate Atiku Abubakar challenging the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 election.
 
Recall that earlier today, Justice Mohammed Garba,-led Tribunal dismissed Atiku and PDP petition in its entirety.
 
It also said it has come to an inevitable conclusion that the petitioners have not proved any of the grounds of the petition as known by law and consequently discarded the petition in its entirety.
 
Reacting Fani-Kayode on his Twitter page said he was not surprised by the ruling.
 
According to him, “If anyone is surprised by today’s ruling in the @Atiku/@MBuhari case then they still don’t understand the nature of the beast we are fighting and the gravity of the situation we are in.
 
“They didn’t just rig the, they rigged the courts too! They control all 3 arms of Government.”
