Divine Oduduru will no longer compete for Nigeria as he is not on the startlist for the men’s 200m.
Oduduru opted out of the 100m to focus on the 200m, but now he won’t compete in that event as well.
The IAAF rule states that any athlete who withdraws from an event after being confirmed in the final entry list, will have to forfeit subsequent events.
Oduduru had pulled out of the 100 metres yesterday as he wanted to concentrate on the 200 metres likewise Blessing Okagbare.
It means With Divine Oduduru pulling out of the men’s 200m, only Emmanuel Arowolo will represent Nigeria in the event which is starting tomorrow.
The 2017 National Champion in the event has been drawn in lane 9 of Heat 5 & will jostle it out with Canada’s Aaron Brown.
Okagbare is likely to face the same issue if found wanting.
The news comes as a sad one for Nigerians as the two athletes are medal hopefuls.
