Members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB in the US have vowed to protest against President Muhammadu Buhari and his government during the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in the USA this week.
Recall that President Buhari, in the company of no fewer than three governors and seven ministers, had departed Abuja for New York city to represent Nigeria at the 74th global meeting of the UNGA.
A source close to the group’s spokesperson, Emma Powerful, quoted him as saying that the group would be resilient and stand against the continued onslaught, arrest and secret abduction of its members by agents allegedly sponsored by the federal government.
“IPOB members in the US were on ground waiting for Buhari to appear in the United Nations General Assembly this week, at the General assembly which was scheduled to start holding deliberation from 25th of September 2019 in the city of New York.”
“The whole world will see IPOB right in front of UN headquarters in New York. The Camallard’s recent press release on Nigeria is one such example. You can see that only the press statement has rattled Aso Rock and Fulani cabals in the villas.
“Our meeting with UN officials last week were frank and forthright. If there were doubts before in their minds that Nigeria is one almighty calamity, the feeling we got after our discussions is that they now have a proper appreciation and deeper understanding of how irredeemably hopeless the case for one Nigeria has become in light of the reign of impunity, poverty, repression, unbridled corruption and collapse of the legal system.
“The well marshalled case for Biafra self-determination by our leader and prophet of our time Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was all too apparent for them to see and persuasively argued to their understanding that IPOB will not retreat nor relent in the pursuit for free and liberation of Biafran people.”
