Dejan Lovren is staying at Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp blocked the defender’s departure on loan.

Roma, AC Milan and Bayer Leverkusen were interested in signing Lovren on loan for the rest of the season and the Croatian international has slipped to fourth in Klopp’s pecking order of centre-halves.

But Liverpool were only prepared to consider a permanent £15million deal for Lovren and were not prepared to let him leave on loan.

Klopp saw no benefit in letting Lovren join another club temporarily to leave himself with just three senior centre-backs.

The Liverpool boss feels he will need Lovren, who has not figured since May’s win at Newcastle , with the Reds facing a hectic schedule over the next four months.

And in other news, De Bock to move to Sunderland. Leeds defender Laurens De Bock is set to join Sunderland on loan.

He was farmed out to Oostende in his native Belgium last term.
