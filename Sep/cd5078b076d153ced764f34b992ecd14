An EFCC officer based in Benin, Edo, was found dead on the weekend, and chances are high the death was suicide, though the state police command has not concluded its investigation.
Williams Oyibogare’s lifeless body, with two bottles of the pesticide Sniper, was found in his home at Giwa Amu, Airport Road, Benin.
A suicide note was found on his phone which the police have already recovered.
EFCC spokesman Wilson Uwujaren confirmed Oyibogare’s death but said the commission was waiting for the police to conclude its investigation before making any further comment.
Oyibogare just came back from his annual leave. His colleagues were however worried about his gaunt looks, making them suspect some terminal disease.
Police Public Relations Officer, Edo Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, said the police would wait for the autopsy before making further comment on the matter.
