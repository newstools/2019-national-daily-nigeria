Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles Coach, has decried that Nigeria does not have quality pitches for football matches. Coach Rohr, therefore, appealed to the new Sports Minster to address the negative trend. The Franco-German football tactician wants Nigeria to take a cue from Egypt which presented quality pitches at AFCON 2019.
He identified bad pitch as one of the biggest problems affecting the Nigerian national team.
It was gathered that the Franco-German football tactician in an interview in Bourdeux, France, lamented that the Super Eagles don’t have excellent pitches to use as home ground and he does not understand why a country naturally endowed as Nigeria cannot develop a standard football pitch.
“One of my biggest problems in the Super Eagles is that we don’t have a single quality pitch, in the whole of Nigeria, for my team to play matches on. This is not acceptable for a country of Nigeria’s level,” noted the former Bordeaux star, who sent a special plea to Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare, to help fix the main and practice pitches of the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja alongside the National Stadium, Lagos.
“I am hoping that Sunday Dare, Nigeria’s new Sports Minister, will ensure that the main pitch and practice pitches of the Abuja National Stadium will be restored, as soon as possible. “This will help my team a lot,” Rohr said.
