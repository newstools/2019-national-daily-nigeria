In spite of diplomatic reactions that followed unbridled attacks of foreigners by South Africans in the last few days, Nigerians and other nationals in South Africa are not  about to get a breather.
Residents of hostels in eastern Johannesburg marched along Jules Street in the area on Sunday, demanding that “foreigners must go back to where they came from”.
Sowetan Live reports that the protesters, were heading to Jules Park where former IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi is expected to address them.
However, the leadership of hostel dwellers has asked the government to engage the citizens about finding solutions to the clashes with foreign nationals.
Siphiwe Mhlongo, chairman of hostel headmen (izinduna) in Gauteng, said; “We are not happy with how the government has tried to resolve the problems that the country is facing.
“The government must come speak to the people and explain what it is going to do with the foreign nationals who are here illegally,” Mhlongo said.
President Muhammadu Buhari is planning to meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa to discuss the way forward.
Meantime, the federal government has asked its citizens in South Africa to leave the country.
