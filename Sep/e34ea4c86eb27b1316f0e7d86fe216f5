The PDP has rejected the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal which upheld President Muhammadu Buhari victory.
The party in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan expressed shock over the judgement, adding that there were so many errors as the Tribunal failed to prove fair justice.
The party described the judgement as provocative, barefaced subversion of justice and direct assault on the integrity of our nation’s justice system.
“PDP is particularly shocked that the tribunal failed to point to justice despite the flawless evidence laid before it, showing that President Buhari was not only unqualified to contest the election but also did not score the majority of valid votes at the polls,’ said Kola Ologbondiyan, party scribe, in a press release.
It described it as  bewildering that a court of law could validate a clear case of perjury and declaration of false information in a sworn affidavit, as firmly established against President Muhammadu Buhari, even in the face of incontrovertible evidence.
Listing all the flaws in the Justice Mohammed Garba-led tribunal, the party said it will seek justice t the apex court.
“Indeed, the pervading melancholic atmosphere across our nation since the verdict is a direct indication that the judgment has not fulfilled the desires and expectations of Nigerians.
The party encouraged Nigerians to remain calm and not to lose hope or surrender to despondency or self-help.
