There were indications of palpable tension in the Presidency and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), early Tuesday morning when the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections, Atiku Abubakar, and the PDP filed appeal at the Supreme Court challenging the judgment of the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal which upheld the election of President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC in the February 23 polls.
The judgment of the Presidential Tribunal which was within the court of Appeal jurisdiction raised questions in the open society over the sanctity of Nigeria’s laws and the ethics of the politicians in the country. Several stakeholders in the Nigerian project expressed dismay over the judgment in view of the controversial issues that were raised at the tribunal.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is the ultimate legal jurisdiction of the country and whatever pronouncement is made at that highest level of Nigeria’s judicial system is final. The renewed legal battle is perceived to have created knew uncertainty in the power tussle for the president, which was said to unsettle Buhari and the ruling APC.
