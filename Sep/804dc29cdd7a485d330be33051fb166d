PDP’s ex-national publicity secretary, Olisa Metuh, on Friday told a Federal High Court, Abuja, how he shared the N400m he collected from Dasuki Sambo, former National Security Adviser under in 2014.
He, however, stated the fund was for “a special national assignment” before the 2015 general elections.
The EFCC is prosecuting Metuh for receiving N400m from the NSA to allegedly fund the PDP presidential election campaign in 2015.
While he demanded earlier in the week former President Goodluck Jonathan be subpoenaed before Justice Okon Abang, Metuh, under cross-examination by the prosecution counsel, told the court Friday Jonathan never directly paid any money to him.
He, however, said that the N400m was for the national assignment as directed by the then president.
Looking at the statement of his account which had N6.6m before  N400m was paid into it on November 24, 2014, Metuh told to the court how he shared the money for the national assignment.
According to him, there was an outflow of N7.5mn from the amount through a cheque to a company, CNC Connect on December 2, 2014, and another payment of N21.7m to late Chief Tony Anenih and N50m to Kanayo/Olisah.
On that same date, he explained that there was another outflow of N31.5mn to one Richard Ehidioha, adding that two separate payments of N200m and N300m were made to Daniel Ford International also on December 4, 2014.
Others included payments to CNC Connect in the sum of N70m on December 15, 2014; N25mn to Abba Dabo on December 16, 2014 and N5m to Mrs Kema Chikwe.
He also claimed he submitted to Jonathan report of all the expenditures of the said N400 million, captured in receipts and signatures for all payment of monies in cash and through several accounts for the special assignment.
He said he had about 19 accounts of which more than five were in Diamond Bank, adding that he made an investment of $2m dollars in cash in ARM, through its official, Miss Nneka Ararume.
Abang adjourned he matter to September 30, 2019, for continuation.
