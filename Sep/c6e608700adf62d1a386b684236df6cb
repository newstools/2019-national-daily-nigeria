Among the top 20 list, only Nigeria, Togo, Zimbabwe, Djibouti and Kenya made it on the continent.
According to the World Bank, Nigeria made improvements by operationalising a new electronic platform that integrates the tax authority and the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC).
“The CAC also upgraded its name reservation platform and, in Kano, there is now an electronic platform for registering business premises online, eliminating the need to appear in person.
