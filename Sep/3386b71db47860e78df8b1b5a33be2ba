The Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) has temporarily relocated its monthly Power Must Change Hands programme from the Prayer City on Lagos-Ibadan expressway to her International Headquarters at Onike in Yaba, Lagos.
The power-packed programme holds in the morning hours of the first Saturday of every month.
According to the Assistant General Overseer in charge of Administration, Pastor Gbesan Adebambo, the relocation, approved by the General Overseer of MFM Worldwide, Dr. Daniel Olukoya, is an interim arrangement informed by the on-going road reconstruction works and the partial closure of the Lagos – Ibadan Expressway.
“Consequently, all MFM Lagos Regional Headquarters are directed to hook up to International Headquarters for live streaming of the programme by 7:00am prompt,” the memo directed.
It added: “Accordingly, you are required to disseminate this information adequately at the regional headquarters, zones and branches in the region under your supervision.”
The memo, addressed to the ministry’s pastorate leaders, also noted that only the regional headquarters is authorised to beam the programme live to worshippers.
