Sen. Douye Diri has emerged winner of the 2019 Peoples Democratic Party, PDP governorship primary election in Bayelsa.
Out of a total of 1,244 accredited delegates, Diri secured 561 votes to beat his closest rival, Chief Ndutimi Alaibe, who pulled 365 votes.
The election, which started at about 11:30 pm Tuesday night, ended at about 5am Wednesday morning.
It was attended by former President Goodluck Jonathan and Gov Seriake Dickson and other major stakeholders of the party.
Dickson and his godfather Jonathan have been at daggers drawn over choice of candidates.
While the governor wants a member of his exclusive Restoration Team, whose members include Diri, Jonathan wants his man and former NDDC boss Timi Alaibe to clinch the ticket.
Series of psychological war and violence led up to the primary–between Jonathan and Dickson as well Diri and Alaibe.
As it turned out, Dickson had his way.
In his address, immediately after the counting of ballots, the chairman of the electoral committee, Taraba Gov. Darius Ishaku, declared Diri winner of the election having met all the conditions and got the highest number of votes.
“I wish you good luck as you proceed to represent PDP in the general election. I want to plead with all of those who participated in the primary election to come together and work as a team so that the state can continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy,’ he said.
“I commend your peaceful disposition before, during and after the election, and the security agencies for providing adequate security for a peaceful, fair and credible exercise.”
Diri, representing Bayelsa Central Senatorial district, will contest the November 16 governorship election with the APC.
