As angry Nigerians protest the killings of their compatriots in South Africa, things are gradually getting violent in locations of major South African businesses across the nation.
Some youths in Uyo on Tuesday invaded the MTN office located along Ikot Ekpene road Uyo, Akwa Ibom, to retaliate the attacks on Nigerians living in South Africa.
The attackers broke into the crowded shop about 2:30 p.m and destroyed glass doors and windows
“They ordered people out, destroyed computers, and took away cash and customers’ phones,” a member of staff of the company explained.
“Nobody was hurt during the attack because we ran out of the shop through the backdoor for safety.”
The National Daily reported the violence was more serious in Lagos where two of Shoprite malls were attacked and some part set ablaze.
The federal government has appealed for calm, and urge citizen to not attack those businesses.
