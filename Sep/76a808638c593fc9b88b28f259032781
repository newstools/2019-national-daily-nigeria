The local Liverpool media has not been slow to put the boot into teenager Bobby Duncan, who left for Fiorentina this week after claims that he was being ‘bullied’ at the Merseyside club.
There have been a series of smear articles about Duncan, with most concluding that Liverpool are better for his exit. Which is of course the perfect response to reports of a distressed teenager.
And then we come to the Liverpool Echo on Wednesday morning, who report with some glee:
‘Fiorentina snub Bobby Duncan in first-team announcement after move from Liverpool’
A reminder – because apparently it is required: He is 18 years old.
