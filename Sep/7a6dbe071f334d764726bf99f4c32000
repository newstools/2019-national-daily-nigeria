A Nigerian has demonstrated how not tolerate corruption in the country. He has shown that corruption can be fought in the country without violence or discrimination and people can also be made to account for their actions. The most interesting part of his action is that people can suffer collective loss because of the corrupt behavior of one or few member(s) of the community.
Oloye Akin Alabi had narrated how some communities in his constituency demanded transformer for electricity distribution to the various households which he responded and intervened.
He narrated that the “Area Boys” or “Omoniles” as they are known in some places, obstructed the delivery of the transformer to a community he responded to first, demanding money from the transformer before the transformer is being delivered. When contacted to report the incident, he directed that the transformer be taken to another community who also demanded for it.
The elders or other residents of that community did not intervene to protect the delivery of the transformer which was a favour done to them by Alabi. Their silence and unrepentant attitude of the boys cost the entire community the benefit of that transformer which was taken to another community on the order of the provider. They suffered collective loss.
Akin Alabi had on his twitter handled, @akinalabi, barrated: “I bought a transformer for a community that requested for it in my constituency. When the delivery people got there, the “youths” there said they must “settle” boys before they drop it. They called me and I told them to take it to another community that asked as well. Their loss!”
Some would have ordered the arrest of the boys, or send stronger boys to overwhelm those boys and force the delivery of the transformer, but Alabi applied wisdom to make the entire community learn the bitter lesson of wrong actions and wrong silence.
