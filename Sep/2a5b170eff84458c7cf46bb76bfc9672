Quite early, but unavoidably so.

The court appearances, is towards settling a bonus dispute with his former club. The Brazilian was spotted at the airport on Thursday, accompanied by his father.

The 27-year-old insists he is owed £10.5million in loyalty bonuses by the LaLiga champions

Neymar received £12.5m from Barcelona, before he joined PSG in a world-record £200m move back in the summer of 2017.

The PSG forward now wants to be paid the rest of the £23m loyalty bonus, that was inserted into his Barcelona contract.
