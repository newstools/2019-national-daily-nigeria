There seems to be no end yet to the conflicts between  the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole,  and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State over the party’s ticket for the 2020 governorship election in Edo State. National Daily learned that leaders of the state APC have taken the party’s crisis to a higher level, deepening polarization and appointing factional APC leaders.  Divisions in the Edo APC were defined in line with the support leanings of party members to the two political principals in Edo State – Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Obaseki – who, however, met during the Muslim festival and declared that they have no conflicts between them. Obaseki had, after the meeting at Oshiomhole’s residence in Edo State, assured that people will begin to see changes in their relationship, indicating that the crisis had been resolved. The emerging conflict in the state party, however, upturns or threatens the resolutions at the meeting Oshiomhole had with Obaseki during the Sallah holidays.
Accordingly, National Daily learned that the APC leaders in Edo State introduced new twist to the crisis when some party members appointed Osarobo Idahosa as the new APC leader in Edo State.
A vote of no confidence was said to be passed on the Secretary to the State Government, Osariodion Ogie, who was the APC Leader in the state.
Ogie was accused of high handedness, flouting party rules and constitution and misleading the people. These were said to be the reasons for his removal as party leader.
