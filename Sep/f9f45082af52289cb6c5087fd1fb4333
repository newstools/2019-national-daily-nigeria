The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has advised people from the Southeastern part of Nigeria to stand up and assert themselves to be counted.
Ngige who made the statement while speaking in Obosi, Anambra State, also boasted that members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) could not attack him outside Nigeria.
He was reacting to the threat by the IPOB members who had allegedly threatened to attack South-East politicians whenever they were spotted outside the country.
He said the secessionists would not do him any harm, because he protected them and their interests when he was Anambra State governor.
Ngige said, “IPOB was registered by the late President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Dr Dozie Ikedife and other Igbo as a non-violent group.
“What is going on now in the group is not part of the work plan. I visited the United States of America recently, and I was welcomed by IPOB members.
“They knew I fed and protected them when I was in office as governor. I have said it several times that Biafra cannot be achieved the IPOB way.
He said Igbo should stop shouting marginalization, advising them to stand up and assert themselves to be counted. Nigeria belongs to all of us. “Equity favours the Igbo to produce the next president of the country, but they must work hard and position themselves for it.
“We should stop political sentiments. Politicians don’t give power based on sentiment and emotion. President Muhammadu Buhari has said he is favourable to an Igbo president.
“We must support him and associate with the APC. Nobody will give you president of Nigeria in your bedroom.”
