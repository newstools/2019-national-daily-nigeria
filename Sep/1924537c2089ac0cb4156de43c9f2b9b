A thunderbolt struck dead a petty thief at Emure Ekiti, Ekiti, on Saturday.
The teenager and his friend reportedly went uphill and shooed away a hen incubating, carting away its eggs to make omelets.
Thunder struck as soon as the boy ate his delicacy, and he died.
His friend, however, was sparedâ€”perhaps for not eating at that moment.
Traditional worshipers of the god of thunder have stormed the community to make sacrifices, especially for the second boy.
