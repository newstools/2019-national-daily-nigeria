The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned President Muhammadu Buhari that the indefinite closure of Nigeria’s borders with neigbouring countries in the West African sub-region will ultimately hurt the economy and cross boarder commerce.
The LCCI President, Babatunde Runwase, was said to have issued the warning at the 2019 presidential dialogue put together by the chambers.
Runwase was said to have advocated policy mix, saying that this is not the best time for the Nigeria’s economy. He decried that the short term outlook of key economic indicators are not looking bright.
