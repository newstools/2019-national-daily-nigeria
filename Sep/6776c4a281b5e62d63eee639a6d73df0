The PDP Board of Trustees are running around now as tension rises in the opposition party following the loss of the party’s presidential candidate Atiku Aubakar–against President Muhammadu Buhari–at the presidential election tribunal on Wednesday.
The matter worsens as Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike, a big shot in the PDP, turns against his party’s candidate Atiku, and makes revelations about PDP’s governors visiting Buhari at night.
Both events, many say, are not only frustrating, but are also signs of betrayal to Atiku.
The BoT is in a quandary on how to handle the issues–either to rebuke Wike who congratulated Buhari for defeating Atiku at the tribunal–or to appease the wrath of Atiku who has become the rallying point of the PDP.
In a move to just do something, the board embers jetted out to Dubai on Saturday to meet Atiku who has refused to come home for  while now.
The move became necessary as Wike remains unpredictable. He has never supported an Atiku candidacy–he preferred Sokoto Gov Aminu Tambuwal during the party primary last year.
And his brazen disregard of party loyalty now might trigger a chain reaction that will pull disgruntled party men across the nation out of the PDP.
Already, the likes of Sen Dino Melaye (Kogi West) and Timi Alaibe, but losers in the last party guber primary are in a foul mood now.
Alaibe is suing hs party for manipulating the election against him. Melaye , cold turkey,also rejected his party appointment as campaign director of the PDP in the coming election he lost to Musa Wada.
The handling of Ndudi Elumelu’s probe in the House of Reps is another tinderbox that might explode and splinter the PDP.
