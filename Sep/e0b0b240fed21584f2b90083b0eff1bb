Others marking Ashura free to observe peaceful procession




The Nigerian Police on Tuesday clarified that the ban on procession is only applicable to the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), saying that other Muslims are at liberty to engage in peaceful procession to mark this year’s Ashura.
The Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, DCP Frank Mba, in a statement on Tuesday explained that “following the deluge of enquiries concerning the ban on procession on the proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), it has become absolutely imperative to clarify that the ban on processions is applicable to members of the proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria only.”
He maintained: “Against this backdrop, Muslims marking the commemoration of “Ashura” throughout the country along with other Muslims across the world are free to carry out the annual “Ashura” procession.”
The Police cautioned that “they should, however, do so within the confines of the law and guard against infiltration by unscrupulous elements who may want to take advantage of the event to cause disruption of public peace, order and security.”
Mba disclosed that the Inspector-General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, has directed all Commissioners of Police and their respective supervisory Assistant Inspectors-General of Police in Commands and Zones to give full effect to the above clarifications and ensure that non-IMN Muslims are not in any way restricted from exercising their freedom of religion, worship and peaceful assembly.
He added that the IGP has enjoined members of the public to be calm and go about their lawful businesses as the Force is doing all within its capacity to ensure there are no breach of the peace, law and order anywhere in the country.
