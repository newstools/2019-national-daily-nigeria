Finally, IGP admits Miyetti Allah into Nigeria policing—like others
Following the security summit the Oyo Gov Seyi Makinde convened between the police authorities and the southwest governors, IGP Mohammed Adamu has revealed some of the strategies that will stem banditry and other crimes in the region.
The most important of these is community policing.
According to him, the federal government will recruit 40,000 community police officers.
”This will complement the police in law enforcement functions within their localities by performing low-risk and non-sensitive police functions,” the IGP said.
More, traditional rulers, local militia, and other citizens will now have one role or the other to play in policing.
”It’s agreed that a committee, consisting of policemen, other security agencies, the OPC led by Chief Gani Adams, Miyetti Allah and the citizenry should be set up in each state,” said Gov. Makinde while reading the communique generated at the end of the summit.
”This will further discuss the modalities on reduction of crime and criminality as it affects the state.”
When Miyetti Allah, the umbrella body of Fulani herders, first proposed the idea of collaboration, especially in surveillance of forests where the killer Fulani herdsmen and bandits hide, many Nigerians and governors kicked against it.
Adamu, however, advised that ethnic profiling and division cannot help in the effort to fight criminals across the region.
