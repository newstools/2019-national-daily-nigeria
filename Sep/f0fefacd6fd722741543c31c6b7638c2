The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned political actors in the forthcoming Kogi State governorship election set for November 16 to desist from spreading fake news and hate speech.
The warning was issued on Wednesday in a statement by INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kogi, Prof James Apam, who said fake news and hate speech could undermine the integrity of the election.
Prof. Apam issued the warning at a workshop organised by the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) on ‘Securing Elections from Fake News and Violence’.
He said; “There are concern over the increasing rate of fake news and disinformation being purveyed on the social media platforms ahead of the November 16th governorship election, which are inimical to the electoral process.
“INEC therefore, urges political parties and political actors to always verify the authenticity of information before pushing them out to the public domain,” the statement read in part.
