Omoyele Sowore arrived the Federal High Court in Abuja at 9 am Monday, set for his arraignment on charges of treasonable felony and others the DSS filed against him for organising the RevolutionNow protest in August.
Although the publisher of Sahara Reporters was surrounded by the DSS operatives for the scheduled arraignment before Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, he was still shouting ‘revolution’ and his supporters waiting in the courtroom joined in the chorus.
Sowore has been in DSS detention since his arrest Aug 3, on order of Justice Taiwo Taiwo who granted the DSS prayer to detain him for 45 days.
Same justice ordered his bail last week, but the DSS has refused the court order to release him.
While the defence team of the suspect, led by SAN Femi Falana, made effort to serve the service the court’s notice of compliance, the DSS has not been cooperative.
DSS spokesman Peter Afunnaya said that the agency had yet to be served with the court order for Sowore’s release.
Falana, however,  said Ayuba Adam of the DSS legal department received the court order on behalf of the agency on September 24.
