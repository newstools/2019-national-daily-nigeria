The Election Petitions Tribunal in Osogbo, Osun State, on Monday nullified the election of the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election, Bamidele Salam, representing Ede North, Ede South, Egbedore and Ejigbo Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly. The tribunal further directed that fresh election be conducted in the constituency to elect a new representative of the people into the National Assembly.
National Daily learned that the tribunal delivered the judgment in the conviction that the allegation of over voting in some polling units in all the local Governments that make up the federal constituency had been established and proved by the petitioner. The tribunal, therefore, ordered that fresh election be conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) within 60 days.
Adejare Bello of the APC was said to have approached the court to request for the annulment of the victory of Bamidele Salam of the PDP after he was declared winner of the poll by the INEC.
Meanwhile, National Daily learned that Salam may be challenging the judgement at the Court of Appeal.
