PDP stalwart Timi Frank has dismissed his party’s chce for the coming guber election, is now rooting for the APC candidate David Lyon.
Frank said Sen. Douye Diri, backed by Gov. Serake Dickson to win the primary, is a weak candidate.
He, therefore, congratulated the candidate of the APC in Bayelsa ahead of the elections.
“APC will win the forth-coming governorship election in Bayelsa State, seeing the weak candidate (Governor Seriake) Dickson and the PDP have chosen as their flag-bearer,” Frank said in a statement released in Abuja on Thursday.
“It is not my wish for the APC to win the forthcoming Bayelsa governorship election in November as I am not a member of the APC neither am I a supporter of the party, but from the look of things, the choice made by Dickson and the PDP is not inspiring. Actually, it’s disappointing,” he said.
He said this is not the first time he is deciding against his party in Bayelsa politics.
“I want to remind those that are surprised that this was the same position I took against my former party, the APC in 2015, when the former governor and now the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva was nominated. He lost the election.
“History is about to repeat itself albeit in PDP because it is making the same mistake that the APC made in 2015.
According to him, the adhoc congress already programmed Diri to win, adding Bayelsans and PDP know that there was no congress in Bayelsa as it was programmed in a way to favour him.
“Bayelsans had looked forward to a formidable candidate in the person of Chief Timi Alaibe but some powerful forces from the PDP’s NWC and Governor Dickson traded Timi Alaibe for a weak candidate for selfish reasons to enable the APC to take over the governorship of Bayelsa State,” he lamented.
“Bayelsans should hold Dickson and PDP’s NWC responsible for the imminent APC’s victory in the state.”
