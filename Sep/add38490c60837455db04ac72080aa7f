In a statement issued on Tuesday in Abuja by Kunle Oyekunle of Orji Kalu Media Office, the former governor of Abia state said while South Africans lived and carried out their businesses peacefully in Nigeria, there would be no reason to allow them operate further if South African government failed to protect the lives of Nigerians.
“If the South African government fails to do more to protect the lives of Nigerians, there should be no reason to allow them to operate freely in Nigeria.
“All their enterprises deserve to be closed down including MTN, DSTV, Shoprite among others. In the spirit of brotherhood, we have supported them. Our doors have always been open, but it’s time to retaliate by shutting our doors,” he said

He urged the Federal Government to hasten the intervention process and institute stiffer measures against South Africa over the endless xenophobic attacks.
