Pastor and founder of the Latter Rain Assembly, Tunde Bakare, has said that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo would have the last laugh over his rumoured travails in the presidency.
Reacting to claims made by a former APC official, Timi Frank that the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) provided N90billion as campaign funds for Osinbajo during the 2019 elections, Bakare said he found the claim difficult to believe.
Bakare who made the comments on Sunday when journalists accosted him at the premises of his church said he was confident Osinbajo would overcome his present travails.
“Vice President Osinbajo will have the last laugh. You think I am stupid? Except he has violated his oath…,” he added.
When asked about the trending video of him declaring that he was going to become Nigeria’s 16th President after Muhammadu Buhari, Pastor Bakare said he was merely expressing his ambition.
The trending video, according to him, is seven months old. He said, “It is the true expression of my political ambition. Whatever God has shown me is my private ambition”.
