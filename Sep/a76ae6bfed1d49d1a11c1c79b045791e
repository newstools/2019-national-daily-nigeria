Policemen and soldiers have barricaded the Lagos office of online news portal SaharaReporters.
The armed agents also prevent anybody from coming in as they shout at those inside to come out.
The online news platform said the security men came in three vehicles.A protest is expected to come up Wednesday in solidarity with the publisher Omoyele Sowore who has been in DSS detention for 47  days after his RevolutionNow protest call that got him arrested.
Despite protests, local and international, against Sowore’s detention, the federal government has refused to grant him bail, having secured a court order to hold him for 9 days while his investigation goes on.
He is detained for terrorism and treason.
