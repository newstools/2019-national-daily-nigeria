The seeming proxy war between the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, and incumbent governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki may not abate soon.
 
Days after publicly claiming that Obaseki sacked the only Commissioner nominated by him, Oshiomhole has again been forced to deny an alleged plot to impeach Governor Godwin Obaseki.
 
Oshiomhole who was reacting to a claim by Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Frank Okiye, that he was making plans to impeach Obaseki with the aid of lawmakers loyal to him, described the allegation as “arrant nonsense”.
 
Speaking with newsmen on Sunday, Oshiomhole insisted that Okiye was not the speaker and that he would not close his eyes to ‘illegal decisions and actions’ capable of derailing the nation’s democracy.
 
He also advised Obaseki to lobby the entire 24 members of the house who are all APC members so as to produce a speaker of his choice.
 
Oshiomhole said; “Exactly the same way the governor of Bauchi said Oshiomhole is his problem. Let me say that one day, we may have a president who may decide to order the military to make sure that they secure the National Assembly and allow maybe a quarter of the members to go in at 12 midnight to elect a Senate president and speaker and then thereafter whoever wished to be inaugurated can go one by one.
 
“That will be a sad day for democracy,” he added.
