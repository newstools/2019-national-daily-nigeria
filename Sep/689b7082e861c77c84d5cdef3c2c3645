The African Development Bank will present its latest report: Creating decent jobs: strategies, policies and instruments on Thursday, 12 September 2019 at 11.30 am.
This report brings together some of the world’s leading labour and development economists to provide specific policy recommendations for creating decent jobs. The report highlights that manufacturing provides more long-term economic benefits than other activities.
It generates economies of scale, encourages industrial and technological upgrading, fosters innovation, and has big multiplier effects. The report also sheds light on the role of prudent macroeconomic policies and shows how best to use special economic zones, industrial parks, agro-processing zones, skill enhancement zones, and apprenticeship and incubation programmes.
The event will feature a presentation of the report, a panel discussion on key themes of the report, and a Q&A session.
The African Development Bank Group is Africa’s premier development finance institution. It comprises three distinct entities: the African Development Bank (AfDB), the African Development Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF). On the ground in 31 African countries with an external office in Japan, the AfDB contributes to the economic development and the social progress of its 54 regional member states.
