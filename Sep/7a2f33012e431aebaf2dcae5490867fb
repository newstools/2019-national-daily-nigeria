Four persons reportedly died in clashes between two rival cults in the Odogunyan area of Ikorodu and Itire in Lagos State on Friday and Saturday.
In Odogunyan, it was learnt that three persons were killed around the Power Line area, near the First Gate.

Another source told one of our correspondents that the fight had not ended as both groups had vowed to deal with each other.
The source stated, “The fight has not ended. On Saturday, the police and local vigilantes in the area recovered three bodies. Many of the Aiye and Eiye members were arrested on Saturday in connection with the killings and the unrest in the area.
“About 74 of the cult members have been arrested and are being detained at the Sagamu Road Police Station, Ikorodu, since the crisis started. A police source told me that the operation is continuing as many of the cult members are being picked up daily.
“The operation is being carried out by the police and the Onyabo local vigilante group. Since the crisis started, about  14 persons have been killed. But those killed on Friday were three.”
