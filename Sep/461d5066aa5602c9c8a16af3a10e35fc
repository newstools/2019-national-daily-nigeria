No fewer than five witnesses and two banks’ officers in Nigeria have been lined up against Omoyele Sowore, publisher of Sahara Reporters charged with treason and cybercrimes in the lead-up to the RevolutionNow protest aborted 48 days ago.
The trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday.
The witnesses include investigation officers and banking officials, including Paul Clement, Moses Amadi, Cyril Odawn and Paul Okafor.
The investigative officers would reveal how Sowore allegedly “mobilised youths across the country to embark on a revolution that will see to the end of the democratically elected administration.”
Two banking officials with the GTB and the UBA will also speak on how Sowore’s banking statements with the various banks were created.
The federal government filed a seven-count charge against Sowore last Friday–for tryig to upturn the government of President Muhammadu Buhari after the 2019 presidential election both contested.
