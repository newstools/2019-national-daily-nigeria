The Delta State National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Asaba has nullified the election of the PDP Sen. James Manager representing Delta South Senatorial district.
​​Tribunal ​ch​airman​ ​Justice O. O. Onyeabo gave the ruling on Saturday.
He ordered a fresh election within 90 days.
Manager’s election was challenged by former Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan who contested on the platform of the APC.
Uduaghan’s lawyerThomson Okpoko (SAN), told the tribunal that the February 23 National Assembly elections in the district was marred by massive rigging.
He prayed the panel to cancel the election and order a fresh election.
