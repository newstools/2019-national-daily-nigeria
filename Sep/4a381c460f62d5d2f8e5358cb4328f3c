Rivers Gov. Nyesom Wike is a liar, said Asari Dokubo, former Niger Delta militant leader, in a reaction to the on-going standoff between Gov. Abdulahi Ganduje and the Rivers governor over demolition of a central mosque in the Trans-Amadi area of Port Harcourt.
Rotimi Amaechi, transport minister, also had problem with the mosque, Dokubo added.
Wike has been in the eye of the storm for allegedly demolishing the mosque—since he declared two months ago Rivers is a Christian state.
The governor, however, denied that, saying there was no building on the site at the time of the clearance. A couple of Muslim leaders in the state also defended the governor, explaining the land is government property.
But Dokubo warned the governor that Islam was bigger than him, despite demolishing the said mosque.
In a Facebook video, Dokubo said there is nothing Wike can do to stop Muslims in the state from practicing their religion.
He explained that he and his family worshipped at the mosque located at Trans-Amadi in Port Harcourt and that the property was legally acquired.
”Wike claiming there was no mosque; I will say that is a lie. He is lying. And you know, Wike you are lying. If there is no mosque why did you go there? We legally acquired the land for the mosque like other groups there,’ he said.
He said they acquired from Dr Sotonye Amadi, and a Christian group acquired part of that land and they have built their churches.
‘Why did you and your brother, Rotimi Amaechi single out our mosque to demolish and to prevent us from building?
”The person who acquired the land for the mosque is an Ijaw man, an Okrika, Ijaw man. This land was acquired legally. Why is this mosque a problem to you?
He said the people are active members of that mosque
”We are Rivers Muslims. There is nothing you can do about it. You will look at us and get a heart-attack. In the next three years you will be out of government house,’ he said.
