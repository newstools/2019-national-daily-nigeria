The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on Monday, cautioned that the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) remains proscribed in Nigeria, saying that the planned protest across the country is tantamount to terrorism. DCP Frank Mba, Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, in a statement alerted that  it has come to the knowledge of the Nigeria Police Force that some members of the proscribed IMN intend to embark on a nationwide procession, ostensibly to cause disruption of public peace, order and security in the Country.
He declared that the Force noted that in line with the Terrorism (Prevention) Proscription Order Notice 2019 of 26th July, 2019, the activities of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria have been proscribed. “Consequently, all gathering or procession by the group remains ultimately illegal and will be treated as a gathering in the advancement of terrorism.
“To this end, the Inspector-General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, has directed the Commissioners of Police in all the States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, as well as their supervisory Assistant Inspectors-General of Police to put in place concrete measures to avert any planned procession and/or disruption of public peace by the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, anywhere in the country. The IGP also enjoins the public to avail the Force with useful information as regards the activities of the proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria,” he declared.
 
The IG of Police was said to have also advised parents and guardians to prevail on their children and wards not to be cajoled into embarking on illegal and ill-motivated activities by anyone or group of persons, under any guise whatsoever.
