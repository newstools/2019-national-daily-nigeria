The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, on Monday expressed sadness over the reported loss of the PDP Women Leader in Ondo State, Mrs. Toyin Ajinde.
Atiku in a condolence message stressed that the opposition party has missed a worthy Amazon and a dependable grassroots mobilizer.
According to Atiku, the death of Mrs. Toyin Ajinde at such a time when the party would require her immense experience and contacts ahead of the governorship election in Ondo State next year is most unfortunate.
“Even more is the bereavement her demise has thrown at her immediate family and associates. We will all miss her for a life of service that she led.
“As people of faith however, we must come to terms with the fact that as mortals, we do not have any control over matters of life and death. We pray to God almighty to grant her soul eternal rest and console her family and PDP in Ondo State,” Atiku declared.
