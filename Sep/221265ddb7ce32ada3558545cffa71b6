Neymar’s future continues to be the talk of Europe as the transfer window slams shut across the continent.


The Brazilian is desperate to force an exit from Paris Saint-Germain back to Barcelona – but the deal looks increasingly unlikely as we reach the final hours of movement between clubs.

Elsewhere, Christian Eriksen continues to be linked with an exit from Tottenham despite starting for Spurs and scoring the opener in the north London derby on Sunday.

And he’s not the only player in the region who could switch clubs with Henrikh Mkhitaryan potentially leaving Arsenal for Roma.
