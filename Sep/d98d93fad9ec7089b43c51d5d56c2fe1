Nigeria has recalled its Ambassador to South Africa, Ambassador Kabiru Bala–just as it  also pulled out of the World Economic Summit.
President Muhammadu Buhari has also demanded full compensation, the News Agency of Nigeria has reported, quoting a “presidential source.”
The move was meant to register serious displeasure with the South African authorities over the ongoing xenophobic attacks on Nigerians resident in South Africa.

Congo, Rwanda and Malawi have since pulled out of the summit.

Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo took the decision Wednesday in Abuja.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, also attended the meeting at the Presidential Villa.

This is about the toughest decision Buhai has taken with respect to frequent killings of Nigerians in South Africa as President Cyril Ramaphosa, many say, fails to stem the violence.

With the recall and demand, Nigeria and South Africa might just be well on a diplomatic collision course.
