Pastor Tunde Bakara, the general overseer of the Latter Rain Assembly, has made his position known about the allegation that Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo got N90bn from the Federal Inland Revenue Service for the 2019 elections .
Bakare said he found the allegation difficult to believe.

“Vice President Osinbajo will have the last laugh. You think I am stupid? Except he has violated his oath…,” he added.


Timi Frank, a member of the PDP in Bayelsa, made the multi-billion-naira allegation against the vice president weeks ago.

Osinbajo has since sued Frank.



Bakare also said that a trending video of him saying he will become Nigeria’s next President was merely an expression of his aspiration.
He also pointed out that the video is seven months old, adding that what God showed him was his personal business.
