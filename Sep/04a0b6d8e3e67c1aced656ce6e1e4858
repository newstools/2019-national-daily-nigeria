The Department of Security Service (DSS) on Monday roughly dragged Omoyele Sowore, Convener of the #RevolutionNow Movement, out of the court premises at the Federal High Court, Abuja, after the court session. The secret police of the Nigerian government inflicted injury on Sowore in the process. It was gathered that the DSS rough-handled and injured Sowore at court premises in the desperation to disallow him to grant interview to journalists who covered the court proceedings.
Sowore, though full of smiles, was said to have blood stain on his shirt from the injury he sustained on his hand while he was forcefully dragged through court back exit.
However, the Federal High Court in Abuja had ruled that the defence counsel filed fresh application for bail which is to be heard on October 3.
Sowore was arraigned on Monday before a federal high court in Abuja on charges of treasonable felony, fraud and other sundry offences instituted against him by the Federal Government.
Sowore and another defendant, Olawale Bakare, pleaded not guilty to all seven charges of fraud and treasonable felony levelled against him.
It was gathered that Sowore, was surrounded by DSS operatives as he arrived the fourth floor of the court schedule of his arraignment Monday morning.
The DSS on August 3, 2019 arrested Sowore for calling for a revolution through a protest scheduled to hold on August 5.
