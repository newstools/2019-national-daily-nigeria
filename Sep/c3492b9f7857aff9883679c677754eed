Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on Monday enrolled one of his sons, Abubakar Al-Siddique, in a public school in the State.
El-Rufai said he had enrolled his son at Kaduna Capital School in order to lead by example and also show his commitment to fixing the educational sector in the state.
Sharing photos from when he went to register his son in the school, El-Rufai via the official Kaduna governor Twitter handle, tweeted, “Reforming the Education sector in Kaduna is a continuing struggle against decades of neglect.”
It would be recalled that El-Rufai had in 2017 said, “I will by personal example ensure that my son that will be six years of age in 2019 will be enrolled in a public school in Kaduna State, by God’s grace.”
