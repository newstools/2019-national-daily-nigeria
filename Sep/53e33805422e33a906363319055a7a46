Pastor Tunde Bakare of the latter Rain Assembly has prophesied again ahead of the the 2023 presidential election,and the prophecy is in his favour.
He declared himself as the 16th President of Nigeria and successor of President Muhammadu Buhari.
According his Sunday sermon,  nothing could change it because he was born for that purpose to be president–a position for which God has been readying him for 30  years, he said.
“I will succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria, nothing can change it. I am number 16, Buhari is number 15. I never said it to you before. I am saying it now and nothing can change it.
“In the name of Jesus, he is number 15. I am number 16. To this end was I born and for this purpose came I into the world. I have prepared you for this for more than 30 years,” he said.
