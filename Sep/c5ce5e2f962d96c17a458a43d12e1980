Gunmen on Monday invaded the Bayelsa State House of Assembly and scuttled the plenary of the House. The gunmen who opened fire in the Assembly scared the lawmakers who flee one after the order for their lives on the hearing of the gunshots.
 The Speaker of the House, Tonye Emmanuel, had to escape with the Mace in the storm of the mayhem.
The invasion of the House by the gunmen scuttled the impeachment of the Speaker, who has been at loggerhead with several lawmakers in the Assembly.  The lawmakers have mobilized for the impeachment of the Speaker which was said to be part of the agenda for the Monday session.
