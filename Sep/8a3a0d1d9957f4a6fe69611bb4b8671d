There are indications of palpable tension gripping investors in MTN, GOTV, DSTV and Shoprite over business misfortune as Nigerians are mobilizing for boycott of South African businesses in the country over the perennial Xenophobic attack on Nigerians resident in South Africa. The rising anger of Nigerian citizens was provoked since the killing of Nigerians in South Africa while the Police and the government of the host country appear to be encouraging the killing of Nigerians by South Africans.
Several Nigerians have been on the campaign which has been spreading like the Australian wildfire in the social media in the past 24 hours.
A Nigerian in his anger declared: “Citizen Nigeria, mobilize now against South African businesses in Naija
#boycottDSTV
#boycottMTN
#BoycottShopRitesNow
#SouthAfricansRoastNigeriansAlive
**START NOW.
“Dump your MTN. Do Not Recharge.
** Una Dey go market before ShopRites Came to town. Go back to your neighborhood provision stores or shops. They are even cheaper. Look around you, ShopRites na just packaging. Dem go waka enter Mushin or Ariara market, buy your village Garri and oranges for cheap, then come sell am to una mugu people. Shine your eyes. NO TO SHOPRITES!
Cut off Your DSTV Cable. Do not reload.
“Enough of Our Stupidity.”
Several others had also declared that they have dumped their MTN cards and would be downing their DSTY and GOTV as well. The war has just began.
