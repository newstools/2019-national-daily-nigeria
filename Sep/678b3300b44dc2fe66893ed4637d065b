The disqualified Housemate at the big Brother Naija Show last Friday, Tacha, who physically assaulted a fellow Housemate, Mercy, has regretted her misbehavior and apologized to her fans. She regretted allowing her weakness to overwhelm her strength in the competition which she expected to end gloriously but unfortunately quitting in shame. She decried going too low by losing control of her emotional pressures, begging for forgiveness.
Tacha, on her Instagram handle, accepted responsibility for her actions, noting that she knew she had to work on her emotional crisis.
She maintained that coming out of the BBN abruptly was not her plan; adding that she was full of gratitude to her fans, who sustained their belief in her in spite of her “imperfection”
Tacha on her instagram handle wrote: “Coming out of the Big Brother House disqualified was never my intention. Unfortunately, my weakness played against my strength and cut short what should have been a grand ending, with or without the prize.
“I sincerely apologize for every action on my part that led to this point and I take full responsibility for it all.
“I’m an adult and ought to be in control of my emotions, but I’m human and I failed time and again. Please forgive me. I sincerely wanted to make it, at least to the 99th day.
“I know I need to work on my emotional health. That’s a fact as I have become conscious of it now. “Being on this show has shown me that, I am not just a work in progress but I have the chance to become a better me on all fronts if I give myself the chance to heal.”
