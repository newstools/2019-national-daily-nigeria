Leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) after a visit to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the State House, Abuja, on Friday, declared Professor Osinbajo innocent of the N90 billion alleged by Timi Frank to be given him by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) during the 2019 general elections. The Association maintained that the allegation against Osinbajo by Timi Frank, former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), was baseless.
National Dailylearned that the CAN National President, Reverend Supo Ayokunle, in a media interaction at the Christian Ecumenical Centre, Abuja, where he held meeting with top members of CAN, affirmed that VP Osinbajo is innocent of the allegation, insisting that the allegation is baseless.
Ayokunle was cited to have stated: “Vice President Osinbajo has cleared the air that the allegation is baseless and there is no truth in it. He said some people are plotting against him and he was ready to provide himself to be cleared.”
The CAN President, therefore, told Nigerians “not to toy with the innocent that are faithfully serving the nation,” vowing that the whole country would rise up to fight for Vice President Osinbajo.
Timi Frank has repeatedly insisted on his allegation that the Vice President collected N90 billion from the Federal Inland Revenue Service to fund the 2019 presidential election; he also declared his readiness to meet the VP in court.
