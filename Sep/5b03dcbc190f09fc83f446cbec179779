After a barrage of allegations on certificate forgery, Ogun Gov. Dapo Abiodun was still able crush his enemies at the the tribunal and the Appeal Court.
A fresh wave of allegation of forgery, however, is surging against him as the election petition gets to the Supreme Court.
The state’s Labour Party accused Abiodun and his party APC of “cooking up a fake letter of disqualification purportedly from the INEC with the view to undermining Labour Party pleadings before the highest court.”
According to the state’s LP Chairman Abayomi Arabambi, Abiodun allegedly wrote a letter indicating that INEC, before the 2019 governorship election, sent a disqualification letter to the LP for its failure to nominate a deputy governorship candidate.
Arabambi denied it, however.
He challenged Abiodun to “produce the purported acknowledged letter from INEC before the Supreme court”.
“The LP will not be blackmailed, hoodwinked or intimidated by any individual, group of persons or institution,” said the party chairman in statement.
“To suddenly manufacture such is not only laughable but criminal. Forgery is a serious offence under our criminal justice system.”
The guber candidate of the LP Modupeola Sanyaolu went to the apex court on Friday to file an appeal for dismissal of Abiodun’s victory on the ground that his election is null and void.
An appeal court in Ibadan had dismissed the LP suit against the earlier tribunal judgement upholding Abiodun’s victory.
The governor has yet to respond officially to the fresh forgery allegation.
