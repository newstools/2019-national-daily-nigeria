After scoring 365 to come behind his main rival polling 561, Timi Alaibe, an aspirant in the just concluded guber primary in Bayelsa, has kicked.
He said there were flaws in the PDP primary, so he rejected the result.
Douye Diri, a senator representing Bayelsa Central, won the primary contested by no fewer than 21 aspirants, including the deputy governor of the state, Gboribiogha Jonah who scored 62.
Alaibe is the only one stewing now. His backer and former President Goodluck Jonathan who witnessed the election has kept his distance.
“Inherent flaws bordering on crass disrespect for legal procedures and party guidelines,” Alaibe said in press release on Wednesday.
“For instance, by the provisions of Section 50(1) of the Party Constitution, the authority to formulate guidelines for all matters relating to the governorship primary is vested in the NEC of the PDP. The election of ad-hoc delegates is one of such matters.
“Strangely, the panel set up to undertake this exercise simply imposed on us a list of electoral and returning officers prepared by the state officers of the party who are avowed members of the orchestrated Restoration Team. Thus, the process was deliberately handed over to the Restoration Team.
“Our protest was ignored.”
He also rejected the use of the local council chairmen and councillors in the state as delegates in the primary.
He described his loss as a setback, hoping “very soon we would be able to realise our aspiration.”
The former NDDC boss has become a career guber contestant in the state.
He was in the APC the last time he contested.
