Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde has expressed frustration over persistent transfer speculation surronding Ivan Rakitic.
The Croatia international has been linked with a move away from Camp Nou, maybe as part of the deal to bring Neymar back to Catalunya.

It is no longer secret that Valverde is tired of the Neymar chase.
