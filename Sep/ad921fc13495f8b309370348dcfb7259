Nigeria can never go on the offensive as xenophobic rage continues against Nigerians and other foreigners in South Africa.
Chairman of the Nigeria Diaspora Commission, NIDC, Abike Dabiri-Erewa stated this after an interactive session with Chairman of Senate Committee on Diaspora and Non-governmental Organisations, Senator Surajudeen Ajibola Bashir.
“South African government has shown serious concern over the xenophobic attacks when about eight of their Police officers who saw the attacks and made no arrests  were arrested and are still in custody,” she said, adding that the SA authorities would be engaged on ways to end the crises.
Dabiri confirmed arrests of eight South African Police officers who witnessed the scene of attacks, but did nothing to arrest the irate youths.
She explained that arrangements have been concluded for the air lifting of the stranded 640 Nigerians.
According to her, those to be airlifted would be captured in the Federal government’s social investment programme
