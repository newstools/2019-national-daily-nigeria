Women can now go topless in America.
A federal high court just legalised it in six American states after a long legal battle.
According to the Washington Times, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a Fort Collins, Colorado, topless ban.
Women can now bare their bosoms more in the states of Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Utah without legal repercussions.
The city of Fort Collins, Colorado, has decided to end its legal battle and not challenge the federal court’s decision.
The court had maintained that banning women from going topless amounted to “unconstitutional discrimination.”
Local officials previously claimed that the court’s ruling meant that women would be “parading in front of elementary schools or swimming topless in the public pool;” however, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals previously upheld a federal judge’s conclusion that deemed the ban discriminatory.
