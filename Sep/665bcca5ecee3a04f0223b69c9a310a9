Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has called on Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to resign his office over the allegations that he allegedly collected N90bn from the Federal Inland Revenue Services for the 2019 general elections.
Reacting to a statement issued by the Professor Osinbajo that he was ready to waive his immunity to allow for proper investigation of the matter, Fani-Kayode dared Osinbajo to prove his mettle as a man by resigning and facing the former Deputy spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Timi Frank “man on man.”
Recall that Frank had alleged that the Federal Inland Revenue Services, FIRS, had released the N90bn to the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo for the 2019 general elections.
He had claimed that he has reliable information from his sources in the presidency to the effect that Osinbajo’s travail has nothing to do with 2023 but alleged mismanagement of about N90 billion Naira released by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to prosecute the last general elections in favour of the APC.
But, FIRS had denied the allegation, saying it did not make N90 billion available to Vice-President for election campaign.
It accused Frank of seeking cheap popularity while threatening that it would file a libel suit if he refuses to tender an apology in three major newspapers within the next 24 hours.
However, Fani-Kayode in a tweet wrote: “If you are really a man don’t just waive your immunity to sue Timi Frank but RESIGN from your position and take him on man to man. He will eat you for breakfast. I know that young man: he is a real Ijaw! Deeply courageous and tough as nails. You cannot intimidate him or break him.”
