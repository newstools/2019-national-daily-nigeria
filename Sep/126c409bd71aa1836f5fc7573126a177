Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank, has dared the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) over threat to sue him for his allegation of finding the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in the 2019 general elections against the Revenue Service.
It was gathered that Timi Frank had in a statement in Abuja in reaction to a response to his press release by the FIRS, cautioned that he cannot be intimidated by the Revenue Service’s threat to sue him, insisting that he stands on his statement and is ready to meet the Service in court.
The FIRS was said to have refuted disbursing N90 billion to Vice President Osinbajo for 2019 electioneering campaign, threatening to sue Timi Frank.
The former APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary had dismissed the FIRS’s reaction as a puerile attempt to sweep the main issues in his public statement under the carpet. He maintained that the FIRS thinks it can continue to deceive Nigerians by claiming unfounded budgetary fidelity.
