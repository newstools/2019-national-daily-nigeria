For about 25 minutes, Pope Francis was trapped inside a Vatican elevator on Sunday.
An electrical fault led to the malfunction of the facility, thus holding the pope until Vatican’s firefighters intervened.
That made the  pontiff arrived late for his weekly address in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday.
“I have to beg your pardon,” he said as he started the address about 10 minutes late, according to Reuters.
He then explained how he got stuck, and the intervention of the fire officers.
“A round of applause for the fire brigade.”
