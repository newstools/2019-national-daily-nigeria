The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, on Wednesday, struck out the argument by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on the educational qualification of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Muhammadu Buhari.
The court held that as against the argument by Atiku and the PDP, President Buhari was eminently qualified to contest the last election.
The court said evidence presented by Atiku and PDP even showed that the APC candidate does not only have a West African School Certificate (WASC), but also possesses more academic qualifications that made him over-qualified to run in the election.
The court also ruled that as against the petitioners’ claim, there is no iota of falsehood in the affidavit of personal information submitted to INEC by Buhari before the election.
The court held that the PDP and its candidate failed to prove their claim that the APC candidate was not qualified to contest the election.
With the ruling, Atiku and the PDP have lost in their petition against Buhari’s eligibility to contest the 2019 election over failure to present WAEC Certificate which is one of their strong points.
