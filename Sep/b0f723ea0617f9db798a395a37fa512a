Senator Dino Melaye has denied promising the controversial  Housemate in the Big Brother Naija (BBN) show, Tacha, who was disqualified at the weekend for misconduct and assault of co-housemate, Mercy, N30 million as reported. Senator Melaye said that the social media source of the information is a fake account.
Senator Melaye was reported to have offered Tacha N80 million in conjunction with a group, Jaruma Empire. They were said to have made the N80 offer to Tacha less than 24 hours she was eliminated from the BBN and has remained subject of pubic opprobrium over her intolerable misconduct that led her disqualification.
The refuting of the report has exonerated Melaye from N80 million reward which indicates that Jaruma Empire had offered Tacha N50 million in the N80 mullion promise.
Before the Friday outburst, Tacha had developed a reputation for arrogance, rude, pride, isolation and solitary behaviours which created disgusting perception from people watching the programme across the country.
In her unmitigated outburst, she made vulgar statements including despising her fellow housemate that she doesn’t need anybody in the show which she anticipated to win.
Tacha has since disqualification incurred the wrath of Nigerian youths who widely condemned her misbahaviour.
Until Jaruma Empire comes to the open with its defence, Tacha may be left with N50 million in the reported N80 million promise.
