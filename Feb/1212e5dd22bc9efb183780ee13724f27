The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured that all was set for this weekend’s rescheduled Presidential and National Assembly elections.

The commission emphasised that, with all materials checked, audited and distributed, only “an act of God” could hinder the elections from holding.

INEC chairman, Prof Yakubu Mahmood who was represented by the Commission’s National Commissioner, Dr. Mustapha Lecky, gave the assurance on Wednesday while addressing a cross-section of the diplomatic community and international election monitoring groups in Abuja.

He noted that, after the failed attempt last week, the commission developed a six-point agenda to ensure the process was successful. “We believe that as a prayerful nation the act of God has been assuaged and that things will go right, we have no reason to feel that anything will go wrong.

“We have received all the materials, they have been checked, audited, people have been informed, party agents have gone there to check,” he said.
