President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Aisha, has urged Nigerians to use their vote on Saturday to decide if the poor should continue to get poorer and the rich richer.

She said this on Thursday when she presented empowerment packs to 1,250 women and youths from the six area councils of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Abuja.

Her husband, Buhari, and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are major contenders for the seat of Presidency in this Saturday’s presidential election.

But speaking ahead of the poll, Aisha called on Nigerians to “decide whether the poor should become poorer and the rich richer or a society where the gap begins to be reduced.”

Her statement was made known in a statement her media adviser Adebisi, Olumide Ajayi, made available to newsmen.

Aisha, according to the statement explained that “poverty is one of the indices that encourage people to embrace vices like terrorism, kidnapping, and begging.”

Speaking earlier at the event, the Director-General, National Directorate of Employment (NDE) Dr. Nasir, Mohammed Argungu, had said that since 2014, the revenue allocation to the agency had not changed.

He however noted that the agency was able to train 861,234 women and youths from 2015 to date, compared to 4,832 trained in 2014/15.
