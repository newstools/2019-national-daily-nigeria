The Trauma Care International Foundation (TCIF) has set  set the Guinness World Record for ‘The most people to sign up to donate blood in 8 hours-multiple venues’.
The organisation, an arm of the Pastor Chris Foundation, championed the voluntary blood donation campaign with remarkable participation from new voluntary blood donors.
More than 3,400 voluntary blood donors signed up at multiple designated venues and hundreds of them donated their blood.
This record blood donation campaign  was achieved through  partnership with various stakeholders including the Volunteer Medical Corps, the National Blood Transfusion Service, and the Lagos State Blood Transfusion Commission, the Federal Road Safety Corps, Christ Embassy Churches and other corporate bodies.
Blood donation helps to save lives.
In fact, every two seconds of every day, someone needs blood. Since blood cannot be manufactured outside the body and has a limited shelf life, the supply must constantly be replenished by generous blood donors.
Today over 75% of the world’s population are potential blood recipients, and less than 1.2% are voluntary blood donors.
With 7 years’ experience in organizing numerous voluntary blood donation and blood donor mobilization drives, the Trauma Care International Foundation has continued to increase the pool of registered voluntary blood donors.
Through the 2019 edition of her Global Voluntary Blood Donation Campaign taking place on June 30th 2019, TCIF   seeks to recruit thousands of voluntary blood donors who will provide safe blood and blood products for transfusion.
This will reduce the risk of transmission of blood transmissible diseases like HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis in the communities.
According to the World Health Organization; an adequate supply of safe blood for transfusion in every nation can only be achieved by voluntary unpaid blood donations.
