A Federal High court in Port Harcourt the Rivers state capital has sacked the Rivers state governorship candidate for Accord Party, Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, on the grounds that he was not the authentic candidate for the party.
He was replaced with Mr. Precious Baridoo, who won the governorship ticket for the party, at the primary elections.
Mr. Baridoo sometimes ago approached the court to declare him the authentic candidate for the party, having won the primary elections as the party flag bearer in the forthcoming governorship polls.
He described Lulu-Briggs as an interloper, insisting that he was neither a member of Accord nor did he participate in the party primaries to win the party ticket.
Delivering the judgement in Port Harcourt the state capital Thursday, the presiding Judge, Justice E. A. Obile states that as at the time of the party Primaries, Lulu- Briggs was still a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress(APC).
However the party said they will appeal the judgement.
