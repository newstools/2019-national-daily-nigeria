The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday arraigned 19 men at the Federal High Court in Lagos for allegedly dealing in petroleum products illegally.
They were charged before Justice Rilwan Aikawa with conspiracy, unlawful dealing in petroleum products and illegally storing them.
EFCC alleged that they conspired to deal in about 21,840 litres of Automotive 605 Oil (AGO) (diesel) without licence.
They were said to have stored the products “in two fibre boots”, contrary to Section 4 of the Petroleum Act of 2004.
Prosecuting counsel Abubakar Idris said the Navy arrested the suspects last September and handed them to the EFCC.
They are Ayeni John, Emmanuel Tosu, Emopin Moneyin, Malade Aiyetimiyi, Odroja Ojuene, Ikedehinbu Idowu, Abogun Ota, Elamah Augustine, Olarotimi Elikanah, Thankgod Benjamin, Abbas Friday and Victor Goldsmith.
Others are Gbenga Thomas, Ibane Austine, Idowu Surprise, Asemia Thomas, Agbayoh Lawrence, Saliu Malik and Ayetiniyi Ademola.
The alleged offence also contravenes sections 1(17), 3(6) and 4 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act of 2004, punishable under Section 17.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
Justice Aikawa ordered that they be remanded in prison custody pending hearing of their bail applications.
