Mike Dean will no longer act as fourth official for Wednesday’s Premier League match between Chelsea and Tottenham after being confronted by Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday.
The Argentine walked over to Dean after the 2-1 defeat at Burnley and reacted angrily towards the referee.
The body responsible for the appointment of officials decided it was best for Dean to be taken off the game.
Andre Marriner will act as fourth official at Chelsea instead.
Professional Game Match Officials Limited has moved Dean so he will instead be on the touchline at Manchester City v West Ham.
The Football Association is still to announce whether Pochettino will face any charge following the incident at Turf Moor.
Pochettino did not reveal what was said or the reason for the strong reaction, although he had complained about a corner awarded in the build-up to the Clarets’ opening goal.
