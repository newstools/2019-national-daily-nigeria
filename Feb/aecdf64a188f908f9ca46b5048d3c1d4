Former Super Eagles attacker, Victor Moses is among the top 10 most overpaid players in EPL, National Daily learnt.
Moses on loan to Fenerbahce from Chelsea is in the rating with Watford loanee Stefano Okaka.
Their earnings were rated based on per minute of action in the 2018-2019 EPL season.
Moses was paid £66,346 for every minute he spent on the pitch prior to his loan move to Fenerbahce.
The former Nigeria international logged 26 minutes in total in matches against Huddersfield and Liverpool this term, and is the seventh most overpaid player in the topflight.
Nigeria-eligible striker Okaka is tenth on the list, with Watford paying him £33,409 per minute.
It is claimed Moses takes home 75,000 pounds per week at Chelsea while the Hornets man, who played 22 minutes before he was loaned out to Udinese, pockets £35,000 a week.
Crystal Palace duo Pape Souare and Scott Dann, Tottenham Hotspur’s Georges-Kevin N’koudou, Chelsea defenders Gary Cahill and Davide Zappacosta are the top five highest paid players in the Premier League per minute of action in that order.
