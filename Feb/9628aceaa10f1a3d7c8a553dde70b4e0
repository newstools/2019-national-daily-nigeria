Former Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel believes the club is still struggling to replace his generation of players.
 The Nigerian star, who is currently on the books of English second-tier club Middlesbrough, believes the Blues are lacking some experience and leadership.
 Chelsea’s hope of a top-four finish took a massive blow on Sunday evening when they were thrashed 6-0 by Premier League leaders and defending champions Manchester City. It was the club’s worst league defeat since 1991.
 Mikel currently finds himself in direct competition with some of his former Chelsea teammates, as Frank Lampard manages Derby County (who also have Ashley Cole on their books) and John Terry is a key figure at Aston Villa.
 He revealed: “It’s not been too bad for the Chelsea old guard, hey?”
 But he believes their departure from Stamford Bridge has left a void, as he analyses Maurizio Sarri’s current crop like a frustrated fan.
 He said: “When I watch them now, they’re fantastic players but I don’t see leaders. During our time I could scream at Didier Drogba or Lampard.
 “I was 24 or 25 years old but I could voice my opinion and it would be heard.
“Now when I watch them, there’s no one talking to each other, taking responsibility of being the leader. You need that edge and right now that’s what they’re lacking.”
