A Former President of the Nigeria Bar association (NBA), Dr. Olisa Agbakoba SAN, swiftly responded to the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) arrest warrant on the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hystice Walter Onnoghen, saying that the CCT has gone too far by issuing a Bench warrant for the arrest of Justice Walter Onnogen.
Agbakoba argued that the CCT should not have issued the warrant when its jurisdiction to try the case is still being challenged in Court.
The Senior Advocate of Nigeria added that the application on challenge is on the CCT docket, and no hearing has occurred yet.
Agbakoba protested that the CCT should have waited for the outcome of NJCâ€™s intervention, and the cases before the Court of Appeal and Federal High Court before taking such action.
He insists the conduct of the CCT subverts the Rule of Law and due process.
