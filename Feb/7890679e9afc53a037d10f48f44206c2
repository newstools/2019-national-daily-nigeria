APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has made mockery of the PDP and its candidates, describing their economic agenda as container economy.
He also hammered ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo and Atiku, saying their government was responsible for the epileptic power supply in Nigeria because, both Obasanjo and Atiku opposed the novel power generation project he introduced in Badagry.
He however, said that he later won them in court and continued with his power project.
He lamented that major multinational companies like Dunlop and Michelin would not have left the country if the Obasanjo-Atiku government, as at then, was dedicated to power supply in the country.
“If Nigeria was dedicated to electricity generation, you would not see Dunlop and Michelin move out of the country. Look at our roads, look at the vehicular density in Lagos alone,” he said during the APC campaign in Lagos on Saturday.
Taking on the PDP vice presidential candidate, he said, “And they call one man Obi, in one party, saying he will create jobs. He has not been able to tell us how we can make brake parts for those vehicles, how we can make wheel spanners on our own for those vehicles.
“And he said maybe he can go and expand the port in Benin Republic so we can clear our cargoes faster. I call that ‘container economy, Obi China.’”
Tinubu assured his party men that President Muhammadu Buhari will win Lagos on Saturday
