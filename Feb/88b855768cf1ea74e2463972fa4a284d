Sergio Busquets lamented the draw against Olympique de Lyon , but did not want to turn on the alarms. It is the return in the Camp Nou and, in addition, is convinced that the team will recover the aim.
Play off
“We do not think it’s a dangerous result, we just focus on going out to win in the second leg, today we were superior and if we want to be in the quarter we must win one of the two matches.”
Unmarked
“The forwards live on the goal, but we can not stay with just Luis, the work he does for the team is important and this will end up breaking.”
Without alarmism
“It would be worrying if we had not created chances, we should be optimistic.”
Dissatisfied
“We’re not happy, I think we played well, to score and win, but football has this, if you’re not successful it costs.
