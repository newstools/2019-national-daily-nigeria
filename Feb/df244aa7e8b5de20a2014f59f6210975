Donald Trump’s Former Lawyer, Michael Cohen, has claimed that the U.S President wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign.
During Wednesday’s testimony, Cohen said Trump directed covert plans for a Trump hotel, even while he denied having any business in Russia.
He also said Trump knew about a leak of hacked democratic emails and called him a “racist”, “conman” and “cheat”.
Trump accused Cohen of “lying in order to reduce his prison time”.
