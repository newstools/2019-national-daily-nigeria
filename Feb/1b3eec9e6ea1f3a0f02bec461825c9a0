 Commissioner, Independent National Electoral Commission, Bauchi State, Ibrahim Abdullahi, has urged the general public to disregard some results of the National Assembly and presidential elections held yesterday being circulated on social media.


The Head of Voter Education and Publicity, INEC, Bauchi, Ahmed Waziri, in a media statement he signed and released to journalists in Bauchi on Sunday evening at the INEC Headquarters, on behalf of the REC, said the results are fake because they were not announced by the Commission.

He said: “The attention of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Bauchi, has been drawn to the circulation of Presidential and National Assembly results on social media.
“It is on this background that the Commission is calling on the general public to ignore all such results as the Independent National Electoral Commission, is the only institution recognised by law as contained in section 27 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), to make such announcements.”
