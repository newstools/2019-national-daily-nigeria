National coach Joachim Loew complains of a “moral decay” on the squares in the Bundesliga. “The behavior of the players on the pitch, we have to start the lever again,” said the 59-year-old on Sunday at the Amateur Football Congress in Kassel.
“Fairness on the court and against the referees are the highest commandment,” Löw also warned.
In the Bundesliga, however, he sees “constant formation of packs, swallows, simulators”, said Löw: “Because of every trifle is protested there.This also see children, as the amateurs see .This we must again point in the right direction that the decisions of Referees are respected again. ”
In addition, Löw believes in an “exciting” championship match between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. “The Bavarians have this unbelievable experience and quality in the middle,” said Löw: “You can also replace three, four top players with their strong bench, they have the nerve to stay tuned.”
The BVB, however, have recently “lost a bit of ground,” said Löw, who wanted to pursue the top match between Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen in the evening: “They stumble a little.”
Bayern had already won 1-0 against Hertha BSC on Saturday and put BVB under pressure.
