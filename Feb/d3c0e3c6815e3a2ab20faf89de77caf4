The non-oil sector growth was thus 38 basis points higher than the rate recorded in Q3-18, and 125 basis points higher when compared to the corresponding period of last year, and contributed 92.94 percent to total GDP in contrast to 90.62 percent and 92.65 percent in Q3-18 and Q4-17 respectively.
The oil sector on the other hand sustained its contractionary trend into the third consecutive quarter, on account of lower crude production. Oil GDP contracted by 1.62 percent as against an 11.2 percent growth in Q4 2017 and a decline in Q3 2018: -2.91%.
The NBS estimated crude oil production over Q4-18 at 1.91mb/d, 0.04mb/d lower than the 1.95mb/d reported in Q4-17. The sector according to the NBS contributed 7.06 percent to total GDP in contrast to 9.38 percent and 7.35 percent in Q3-18 and Q4-17 respectively, during the review period.

According to Olusi, these are pointers to the authorities on the importance of certain issues that must be swiftly addressed so as to enable the reportage of more of the kind of numbers the country ought to see.
