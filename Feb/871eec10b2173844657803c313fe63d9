The Nigerian Army on Saturday confirmed 66 people were killed in certain communities in Kajuru Local Government Area, Kaduna State. The Army attributed the killings to clashes between communities in the LG.
National Daily gathered that the General Officer Commanding, One Division of the Nigerian Army, made the confirmation shortly after a visit to Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, and heads of security agencies in the state that later went with him to the burial sites of the deceased.
The GOC’s confirmation was further confirmed by the Kaduna State Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Abdulrahman, who was also in the team.
The Kaduna State Governor expressed that he was pained at the loss of lives and property but said that he has been vindicated.
El-Rufa’i expressed the hope that the violent outbreak would silence dissenting voices, who have been calling him a liar.
The Kaduna State Governor said more people, according to reports, were killed beyond the figures released by security agencies.
