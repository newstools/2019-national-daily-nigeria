An early morning attack by three suspected Boko Haram terrorists sent at least five people to their early graves near a Mosque in Molai, Borno State.
One of the attackers was a suicide bomber, whose explosive vest killed one civilian. One other attacker shot at civilians, while the third was armed with a knife.
Immediately the attack occurred, special security forces were deployed to the area, which killed one of the Boko Haram terrorists while the last one armed with a knife was lucky to escape.
Security officials later cordoned off Kusheri and Gwazari areas in search of the escaped terrorist.
