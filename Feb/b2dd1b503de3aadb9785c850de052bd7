Three persons were reportedly shot dead on Monday when policemen and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra clashed in Owerri, the Imo State capital.

A police source on Tuesday said that the IPOB members stormed the Okigwe Road and started destroying billboards of candidates of political parties.

A police detachment was deployed to rescue the situation, but the IPOB members allegedly attacked the operatives.

The source said, “The IPOB members stormed the street and started destroying billboards of candidates of political parties. Policemen quickly rushed to the scene, but on sighting the policemen, the IPOB members attacked them.
