The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has extended the deadline for the collection of the Permanent Voters card (PVC) to Monday, 11th February, 2019. The Commission explained that the extension date gas become necessary because of the number of unclaimed PVCs at INEC offices across the country.
The Independent National Electoral Commission had on April 27th, 2017, began the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise which ended on August 31st, 2018, and in the course of the exercise, INEC addressed requests for the transfer and replacement of lost or mutilated PVCs. But of the 84million registered voters, many are yet to collect their PVCs.
To ease the pressure of PVC collection, INEC decentralized collection to the ward level between January 16 and 21, 2019, at the expiration of which collection was reverted to local government areas.
