The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the judgement of the Court of Appeal and the High Court in Rivers State which nullified the primary elections conducted by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State.
The judgement of the Supreme Court, which is a big setback for  the APC, settles the matter  that APC will not field candidates in \Rivers State for the Feb 16th National Assembly elections and the March 2 Governorship and House of Assembly elections.
There has been a tussle of factions in the state some loyal to Senator Magnus Abe and the other loyal to former Governor Rotimi Amaechi, now Minister of transportation, with both holding parallel primaries in the state and claiming authenticity.
However, in its judgement on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the Rivers APC is out fo the race for 2019, the apex court, accordingly, upheld the judgement of the High Court.
Apparently, the pressure on INEC to postpone the election in Rivers State has been neutralized by the decision of the court.
