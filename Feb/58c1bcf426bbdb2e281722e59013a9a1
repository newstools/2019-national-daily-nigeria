The Peoples Democratic Party Campaign Organisation has expressed strong opposition to the demand for reshuffling of the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) made by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at its caucus meeting in Abuja on Monday because of the postponement of the general elections last Saturday.
The PDP Presidential Campaign Council in a statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, argued that the ruling APC is pressuring the electoral commission to implement the reshuffle in order to manipulate the votes.
The PDPPCC declared: “Intelligence available to us shows that the Buhari Presidency has directed the leadership of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately reshuffle the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) in order to deploy compromised officials to manipulate the electoral process in President Buhari’s favour, as they did with the police shortly before February 16.
“Our party is also aware of the pressure being mounted by the Buhari Presidency on INEC to cancel elections in some states and make others inconclusive so as to achieve President Buhari’s objectives of a staggered election not minding the crisis such will trigger across the federation.”
INEC shifted the elections to hold within one week intervals, thus, the presidential and national assembly elections will hold on February 23, 2019 as the new date for the vote
