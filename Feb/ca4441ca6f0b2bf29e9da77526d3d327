The wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, has sent a tweet apparently in support of the statement by the president where he said security agencies should deal ruthlessly with those planning to snatch ballot boxes during the general elections.




Buhari had during a speech at the APC caucus meeting in Abuja on Monday, February 18, gave a strong warning to those planning to disrupt the elections through rigging.

He warned that anyone planning to snatch ballot box during the elections will be doing so at the expense of his life.

Though Buhari’s statement has been met with criticism from members of the opposition, the First Lady seems to have backed her husband’s directive to security agencies over the issue.

Aisha in a tweet on Monday, February 18, shared a video of Buhari making the statement with the caption #ThisIsGMB taking Nigeria to the #NextLevel, in apparent support of the statement. Meanwhile, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari’s warning that those who try to snatch ballot boxes during the general elections will be doing so at their own risk.

 Bayo Olupohunda Dogara, speaking at press conference on Monday, February 18, said Buhari’s statement was a violation of Nigerian laws which have provided sanctions for electoral offenders.

He stated that the president’s statement was dictatorial in nature, noting that it indicates that the military has been given a central role into the conduct of the election contrary to the Nigerian laws.
