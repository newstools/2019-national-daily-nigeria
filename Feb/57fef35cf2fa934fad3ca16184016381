The Kano Police has deployed dozens of patrol vehicles on the major streets, and has arrested 500 people it described as “miscreants.”
With barely 24 hours to the presidential and National Assembly elections, the Police in Kano have deployed dozens of patrol cars on major streets, some of which were donated to the state Police Command by the Dangote Group.

The vehicles formed a long queue, with sirens blaring, while armed Police operatives followed in Hilux vans.
The state Police Commissioner, Mohammed Wakili, while responding to a question from our correspondent, said the Command was “prepared to deal with anyone who foments trouble, no matter how highly placed.”
He said, “We have so far arrested over 500 miscreants and still counting. We are ready to arrest anyone who foments trouble. We have said it and I will repeat it, we will not allow anyone to foment trouble in Kano.
“The election is tomorrow, people should go out and vote peacefully. The Police is ready to provide security for all law-abiding citizens.”
He also explained that news making the rounds that some persons were arrested with thump printed ballot papers were untrue.
Wakili said, “The ballot papers were speciments meant for voter education. We are ready to provide security to ensure a peaceful process.”
In response to a question from some European Union Observers who visited him in his office, the CP said there has been no incident of purchase of Permanent Voter Cards.
