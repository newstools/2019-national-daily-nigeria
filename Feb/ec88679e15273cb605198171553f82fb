The Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has revealed that the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had given false information on his claim that bad weather obstructed the operations of the commission in the distribution of elections materials across the country, which was part of the reasons for the postponement of the 2019 general elections last Saturday.
Siriki on series of tweets stated that the country’s weather was good for flight operations on the eve of the elections, indicating the INEC had lied.
The INEC Chairman, Professor Yakubu, on Saturday explained that the presidential and National Assembly elections were postponed last Saturday because of bad weather which affected flight operations, and thus, obstructed effective distribution of elections materials in the states of the Federation.
The Minister on his Twitter handle on Sunday, that INEC should say something else instead of using weather as an excuse.
“INEC should say something else as weather was good for flight operations on the eve of elections, similarly all airports were directed to open 24 hours during the election period,” Sirika tweeted on Sunday.
The minister also stated that all airports were directed to open 24 hours during the election period and further gave thumbs-down to INEC in his tweets.
