The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Barr Boss Mustapha, is an indigene of Yola North, not Hong as assumed by many.
A Principal Special Assistant (PSA) of the SGF), Alhaji Mohammed Danjuma, who made the clarification, said it was necessary to correct reports accusing the SGF of failing to deliver his LGA, said to be Hong, to President Muhammadu Buhari and even not voting there despite.
The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23 presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, defeated Buhari in Hong LGA by 23,039 votes to 20,471; but Buhari won big in Yola North where Boss Mustapha voted, with 43,865 votes against Atiku’s 27,789.
Against the claim that Boss Mustapha’s home LGA is Hong where he should have voted and delivered to Buhari, Alhaji Mohammed Danjuma said Boss is linked to Hong because it is his ancestral LGA where his parents came from more than 80 years ago.
Danjuma said, “Yola North has been Boss Mustapha’s home. This has been so since he was born and bred in Jimeta (in Yola North) in 1956. He has been known as an indigene of Yola North. It was his home when he contested to be governor of Adamawa State in 1992.”
He added that in the last presidential election, Boss rightly voted in his polling unit 09, opposite the main gate of New Government House in Jimeta, Yola North LGA; and specified that Boss name is in Number 902 out of 1307 of the list of those registered at the polling unit he usually votes.
“May I put it on record that the SGF is an indigene of Yola North LGA, not Hong? His political enemies should please go and find better things to do as our principal is a die-hard APC and core Buhari loyalist,” Danjuna concluded.
