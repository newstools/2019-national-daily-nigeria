Real Madrid defender Marcelo could be reunited with former Coach Zinedine Zidane at Juventus this summer, according to reports.
Sergio Reguilon appears to have replaced Marcelo in the first-team of the European champions and the Brazilian has been linked with a move to Juve for months, which could see him join his close friend Cristiano Ronaldo.
Marca cite a report in Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport claiming that the full-back could join the Bianconeri while Zidane could follow him to the Italian champions.
The agent of Ajax full-back Nicolas Tagliafico has also claimed Madrid are interested in his client due to their belief Marcelo will leave the club this year.
“It’s said that Tagliafico’s name has been included on Real Madrid’s shortlist because Marcelo will join Juventus,” Tagliafico’s agent Ricardo Schlieper told Radio Rivadavia earlier this week.
Tagliafico, 26, joined Ajax from Independiente a year ago and could be part of a circle of transfers this summer.
