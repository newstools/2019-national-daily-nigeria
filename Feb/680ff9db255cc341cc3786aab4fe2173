Two unlikely style icons have emerged in Vietnam’s capital of Hanoi, thanks to a barbershop giving out free Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un haircuts ahead of their summit next week.
About a dozen customers have opted for the politically-inspired ‘dos at the Tuan Duong Beauty Academy, choosing to emulate either the North Korean leader or the president of the United States.
It’s not caused quite the frenzy Jennifer Aniston did in the 90s when scores of fans began adopting her signature ‘Rachel’ hairstyle – but it’s clear the leaders have fans in Vietnam.
“Many people say that I look like Kim Jong Un, especially when I have this hairstyle,” said nine-year-old To Gia Huy, who received one of the makeovers.
He said he hoped for a chance to meet the leader when he arrives in the capital for his second summit with President Trump, which follows their historic meeting in Singapore last June.
Hairdresser Le Tuan Duong – who is offering out the free haircuts – decided he needed to do something to mark the event.
“Hanoi is a city of peace. When Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un decide to come here to talk about restoring peace, I think I should do something to show that Hanoi people welcome the summit,” said Duong.
He said Mr Kim’s hairstyle represents youth while Mr Trump’s displays power.
He also revealed that the North Korean leader’s style was more popular with customers.
However, motorcycle taxi driver Le Phuc Hai, 66, chose to emulate Trump’s yellow locks and confessed: “I really like Donald Trump so I want to have (his) hairstyle.”
The summit will see President Trump attempt to encourage North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme and return the country to the nuclear non-proliferation agreement.
