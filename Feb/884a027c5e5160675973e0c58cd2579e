The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Plateau State has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Halilu Pai, of creating tension in Plateau State.
The failure of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to announce some results of Saturday’s elections from the three senatorial districts in the state has been generating tension and anxiety in the past four days in Plateau State.
The PDP said it is aware of the plan to subvert the will of the people.
The party frowned at the cancellation of some results and accused the electoral umpire of compromise.
The PDP stakeholders led by the governorship candidate, Senator Jerry Useni, thereafter, embarked on a peaceful procession to the INEC headquarters in Jos on the need to declare results of last Saturday’s elections.
