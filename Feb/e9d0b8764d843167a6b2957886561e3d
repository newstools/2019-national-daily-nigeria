Nasarawa United gaffer coach Bala Nikyu has described football as a funny game following the surprise results recorded in the mid-week fixtures of the on-going NPFL
“The truth is that football is a funny game, anytime you win, it is said you played to instructions, but when it is the other way round, it is said they didn’t play to instruction. He said
“Football as a game revolves, you could have a wonderful result today and tomorrow, revise is the case.
“Regarding the match, it’s a good win for us, honestly, we played lesser in effort than our previous match in Omoku.
“Yes, we were quite wasteful with goals,  we actually lost some vital chances,  which is normal in a football game,  sometimes anxiety can cause such situations to occur,  when you hurriedly want to score at all cost and it might just end up causing mistakes. The goal will come at the time when you less expected it which we saw. He explained
On the results of the games at other league centres, he said
“I would  say let us wait and see the end of the league, but if the officiating continues this way, i am very sure we would have a happy season. The former Katsina United gaffer concluded.
