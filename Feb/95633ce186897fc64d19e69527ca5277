LA Galaxy have announced they will unveil a statue devoted to David Beckham next month.
The MLS side revealed via a mass email to season-ticket holders that the statue will be unveiled at Dignity Health Sports Park on March 2 ahead of their opening league game of the season against the Chicago Fire.
Beckham made 122 appearances for the Galaxy during a five-year spell in California.
However, he was not always the most popular with the clubâ€™s fans and was even jeered at times for his decision to join AC Milan on loan on two separate occasions, which forced him to miss part of the MLS season.
Yet, the former England captain helped the Galaxy win the MLS Cup in 2011 and 2012, which helped ensure he is today remembered as a club legend.
Beckham was among the first high-profile players to move to America and it has since prompted the likes of Steven Gerrard, Thierry Henry, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Andrea Pirlo to spend the autumn years of their careers in the league.
