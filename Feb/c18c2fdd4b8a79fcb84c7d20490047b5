The 68-year-old has stated that he has no plans to retire and his been linked with a number of roles.
Henrique has often had a difficult relationship with head coach Thomas Tuchel, with the German openly critical of the club’s transfer activity during the January window.

“I’m close to him and I’ve known him for a long time. He is a wonderful manager and coach. He has a very sharp and very complete knowledge of football.
