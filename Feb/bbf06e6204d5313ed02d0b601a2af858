Napoli and Inter have both reportedly joined the race to sign Real Madrid midfielder and Juventus target Isco.
Isco has long been linked with Juve but while Corriere della Sera claims they have already enquired about the Spaniard, so have Napoli and Inter.
The newspaper explains he could be involved in an exchange deal with Nerazzurri outcast Mauro Icardi, while Los Blancos would want Alex Sandro in return from the Old Lady.
That leaves the Partenopei, whose Coach Carlo Ancelotti is ‘pressing’ to reunite with his former Madrid player.
The 26-year-old was dropped for Madrid’s 3-0 Clasico defeat to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey semi-finals on Wednesday.
