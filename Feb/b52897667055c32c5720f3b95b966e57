Pep Guardiola says he does not understand the sacking culture at Chelsea and has called for Maurizio Sarri to be given more time, National Daily gathered.
Sarri faces an uncertain future at Chelsea, with the club understood to be considering potential replacements for their head coach and fans growing frustrated with his tactical approach.
Manchester City manager Guardiola, who was an admirer of Sarri’s Napoli team, offered his support for the Italian earlier this month, saying his tactics had been misunderstood at Chelsea.
He said: “The situation is a little bit different. In my first year, the club never doubted me. It was never in the media that I’d be sacked if they lose this game or the other game. It never happened.
“Sometimes the situation is difficult and it needs time. The first season with Maurizio is the same. You need time but the people supported me here.
“The players knew who the manager was and everybody is in the right situation. After that you can win or lose but it is stable. That is the best way to build something for a long time, not just a short period.”
