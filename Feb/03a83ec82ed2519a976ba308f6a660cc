Organisers of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) have released new dates for many of its rescheduled fixtures, occasioned by the postponed national elections in Nigeria and the continental engagements of Lobi Stars and Rangers International, National Daily gathered.
The league’s first stanza was due to end on Wednesday according to the season’s schedule and calendar but the games were postponed indefinitely. However, the League Management Company (LMC) has rescheduled some of the outstanding games starting from this weekend.
Four matches are billed to hold on Sunday, March 3 including Lobi Stars’ home tie with Katsina United in Makurdi. Enyimba will be guests of Bendel Insurance in Benin city while Akwa United will hope to extend their unbeaten run when they travel to Gombe United. Kada City’s clash with Yobe Desert Stars in Kaduna rounds off Sunday’s schedule.
