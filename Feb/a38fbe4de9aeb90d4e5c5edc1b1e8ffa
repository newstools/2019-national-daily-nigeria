Presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, says he’s hopeful of winning the election, and looked forward a successful transaction in May, 2018.

Atiku stated this shortly after casting his vote alongside his wife, Titi Abubakar, in his local government area of Jada, Adamawa state.

Dressed in a flowing Babanriga and a matching cap, both with subtle green embroidery, Atiku cast his ballot about 10.05am.

Asked in Hausa what he made of his chances, he said, “I will be the one to be announced the winner. I look forward to a successful transition.”

In response to a question on whether he would accept the results, Atiku answered, “I am a democrat.”

Addressing a throng of local and international journalists, he said, when asked of his impression of the polls, “So far so good. I am impressed with turn out, and I hope INEC officials would be able to cope with the turnout.”

Atiku is the major presidential contender hoping to wrest power from incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, who is seeking re-election under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) platform.

Buhari, who voted earlier, had said when asked if he would accept whatever be the outcome of the election, said that he will be the winner and was going to be congratulating himself at the end of the poll.
