It is clear that, following Hector Bellerin’s anterior cruciate ligament injury, Arsenal have a problem at right-back.
There are options in that position in Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Stephan Lichtsteiner and Carl Jenkinson but none of them are particularly appealing.
Maitland-Niles, for instance, is more of an attack-minded player than a defender, while Lichtsteiner has struggled to cope with the pace and intensity of the Premier League and Jenkinson has made just one league appearance this season despite being fit for much of the campaign.
The 20-year-old is now in his fourth season at the club and was especially impressive as the U23s won the title last campaign.
This season Osei-Tutu has found it difficult to build up momentum due to injuries and suspension, but he is now fully fit.
On Monday night Osei-Tutu produced an impressive display in the first 45 minutes of the U23s’ game against West Ham United before the match was abandoned due to fog.
Osei-Tutu is also dependable defensively, although one criticism of him is that he is occasionally a little too rash in the challenge.
On the whole, though, Osei-Tutu is an encouraging prospect and at the age of 20 it would be an ideal time to see whether he can cope with the demands of the senior game.
