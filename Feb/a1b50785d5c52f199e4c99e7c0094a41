Pep Guardiola has heaped praise on Leroy Sane, hailing him the best winger in the world.
Leroy’s stunning free-kick against Schalke proved crucial in our comeback against the German-side, inspiring us to a 3-2 win.
As we prepare to face Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final, Pep was asked whether he thought Sane could play in the middle, our boss explained why he would rather keep him out wide.
“Playing in the middle he can do it,” Pep told the press. “But I think he’s better out wide.
“I’m not saying he can’t (play in middle) but at the moment we have better players to do that job.
“But Leroy is best playing in the world out wide.  I’d prefer to use him where he is strongest, he’s an incredible player.”
With the Blues seeking to retain the League Cup, Guardiola also spoke of the boost winning a trophy in February can provide, ahead of the run-in – as it did last season.
The Catalan boss also warned of a Chelsea backlash, following the Champions’ 6-0 triumph at the Etihad Stadium earlier this month.
“It was really important [to win the Carabao Cup],” he declared. “In the Premier League, we were flying in that period but in the days before, we went out of the FA Cup at Wigan.
“It is not the most important title but we are here, playing at Wembley – a magical stadium, against a top side in Chelsea.
“In the moment, I was so happy but today, I wish we hadn’t beaten them 6-0!
“I don’t like to play one team in a short period of time, after you’ve beaten them. They are professional players and they will go extra.”
