The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of plotting to use N112.5 billion to massively buy votes for the Saturday Presidential and National Assembly elections.




The Ekiti State chapter of the party made this allegation in a statement Monday night, alleging that the earmarked billions is to be used to buy 15 million votes at N7,500 per voter.

“Their plots are in two folds. While they are forging ahead with their clandestine plot to compromise the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and rig the elections by getting the electoral commission to produce two sets of result sheets (Form EC8A) for some selected polling units across the country, they are also plotting massive vote buying,” the opposition party claimed.

Director of media and publicity of the Atiku/Obi PDP Presidential Campaign Council in Ekiti State, Lere Olayinka, who made the allegation added, “50 per cent of the $322 million recovered Abacha loot is being deployed into the vote buying plot while each APC controlled State has been billed minimum of N3 billion with Lagos to contribute N40 billion.”


He further alleged that security agents are to be instructed to provide cover for all APC stalwarts to be assigned with the responsibility of ascertaining voters compliance and making payments to voters who complied.

The PDP therefore called on voters to reject monetary inducement from the APC, saying “those who impoverished Nigerians and caused loss of over 10 million jobs must not be allowed to pay themselves into power.”
