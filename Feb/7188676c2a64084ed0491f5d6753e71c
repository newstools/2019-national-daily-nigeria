Juan Mata admits to making the injury he picked up against Liverpool worse by chasing Mohamed Salah, but hopes to be back for Manchester United “as soon as possible”.
A remarkable first half during an eagerly-anticipated clash at Old Trafford saw four Red Devils pick up knocks, while Roberto Firmino was forced off for the visitors.
Mata, Ander Herrera and Jesse Lingard had to be replaced inside the opening 45 minutes of a goalless draw, while Marcus Rashford nursed his way through the pain of an ankle ailment.
Mata believes his knock is not too serious, but is unlikely to play any part against Crystal Palace on Wednesday.
That is a source of frustration for the Spaniard, who admits luck deserted United on the injury front against their fiercest Premier League rivals.
Mata wrote in his personal blog: “Everything possible seemed to happen to us.
“If there is a game that no United players want to miss, it is when we play Liverpool, but you have to accept that injuries are a part of the sport.
