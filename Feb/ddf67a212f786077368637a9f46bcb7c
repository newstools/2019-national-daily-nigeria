Ex-Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney says he would have voted for Cristiano Ronaldo to win the Ballon d’Or rather than Luka Modric.
Ronaldo was beaten into second place by Modric at last year’s ceremony, the Portugal superstar missing the chance to win the award for the sixth time.
The 33-year-old ended Ronaldo and Lionel Messi’s duopoly over the accolade, with both men sharing the award equally over the previous decade.
But Rooney says his former Man United team-mate would have had his vote for the Ballon d’Or over Modric.
“Luka Modric is a fantastic player,” Rooney told DAZN. “I think his passing is great and the way he moves with the ball.
“Actually he doesn’t look that quick to the eye but when you play against him he glides past players. He’s a fantastic player, he’s had a great career.
“I don’t think he’s the best player in the world but in terms of the year is he worthy of it? Of course, he is. He had a great year with Real Madrid and obviously had a great run as captain with Croatia.
“I think if it was player-voted I would have voted for Ronaldo this year, but taking nothing away from Luka Modric. He won it so he deserves it.”
