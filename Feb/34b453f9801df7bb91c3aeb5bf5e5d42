The acting Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has warned those who may want to undermine the electoral process to steer clear of polling stations during Saturdayâ€™s elections.
In a statement issued by the Force Spokesman, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Frank Mba, Adamu said those who engage in ballot box snatching, hate speeches, and vote trading would face the full consequences of the law.
He said adequate security measures have been put in place to ensure a safe, secure, and conducive environment for a peaceful and credible election.
The acting Inspector-General of Police, therefore, called on the citizens to come out en-masse on Saturday to cast their votes without any fear or apprehension.
He reassured that security personnel deployed for the elections have been trained and under strict instruction to abide by the standard operating procedures of the force.
The statement quotes the Police chief as saying that the Police will remain patriotic, steadfast, professional, neutral, and civil, but firm in their conducts and actions throughout the period and beyond.
Adamu implored the public not to feel intimidated but should be emboldened by the presence of security personnel deployed to their areas.
