A Nigerian soldier has lost his life during the election period.

It was reported by the Headquarters of the Nigerian Army that he died while fighting against alleged political thugs.

The news of his death was more painful to many because the said man died just two months to his wedding.

 The officer whose name is Luka Ishaya Kurmi is a lieutenant serving under the Nigerian Army.

Alongside some other soldiers, he had an encounter with certain hoodlums during election duty in Abonnema, Akuku Toru, Rivers, on Saturday, February 23.
His death was especially painful to many because he was supposed to get married to a certain lady named Alheri Ganya Bissa.

Their wedding was supposed to take place on Saturday, April 20, in Kebbi State. In honouring the memory of his death, a statement has been released by the army through Sagir Musa, its spokesperson.

It was revealed that the attack which they claimed was pre-planned occurred in between Charles and Bob-Manuel’s compounds in Abonnema Town at about 1:00am on February 23, 2019.

 A lot more was said in this accord. Read the words below:

  “The attackers barricaded a major road into the town and laid an ambush in the adjoining built-up areas from where they opened fire on our unsuspecting troops when they attempted to remove the barricade.

 “The gallant troops fought their way through the siege and in the process killed six of the assailants.

 However, we lost a lieutenant in the encounter.

“Preliminary investigation indicated that one Roland Sekibo, – the Chairman Akuku Toru LGA, Omodo – the CSO Akuku Toru LGA and Kenneth of Kula currently at large were the masterminds of the unexpected/ unprovoked attack.

“To this end, the NA strongly hereby states that perpetrators of this ambush will be made to face the full wrath of the law.
