Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), says there is no reason “whatsoever” to resign.

Speaking at a press briefing in Abuja on Thursday, the INEC chairman said he has been doing his best in his service to the nation.

“There is no reason whatsoever to resign. No reason to even contemplate that,” said Yakubu while responding to one of the questions at the briefing.

He also said dismissed the call for reshuffle of residents electoral commissioners (RECs), saying such could not happen on the eve of the elections.

At the caucus meeting of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja on Monday, Adams Oshiomhole, chairman of the ruling party, asked the commission to reshuffle some RECs.

He also alleged that Mike Igini, the REC of Akwa Ibom, was working for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

Oshiomhole also joined those who asked the INEC chairman to step down but the opposition to this came from his party as two minsters said that should not happen.

Babtunde Fashola, minister of power, works and housing, and Adebayo Shittu, minister of communications, said there was no reason for Yakubu to resign.
