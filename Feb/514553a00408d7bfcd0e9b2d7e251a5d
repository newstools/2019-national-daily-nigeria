Analysts attributed the drop in indices to profit taking by investors taking on the Exchange, saying the trend would be sustained to enable investors leverage the moderate appreciation recorded in the last few days to recoup their investment.

Specifically, analyst from Afrinvest said: “We expect to see sustained profit taking in previous advancers in the last two sessions before the elections.”

Similarly, Codros Capital said: “Our outlook for equities in the near-to-medium term remains conservative, and we guide investors to trade cautiously, amidst absence of a near term catalyst and political jitters ahead of the upcoming 2019 elections.

“However, macroeconomic fundamentals remain stable, evident in the release of the Q4-18 GDP figure (2.38% y/y), and remain supportive of recovery in the long term.”
