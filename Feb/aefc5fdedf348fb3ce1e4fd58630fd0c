The United States of America (USA) has declared that the result of the 2019 general elections is important to the entire world.
The US Ambassador to Nigeria, Stuart Symington, made the disclosure after a closed door meeting with Nasarawa State Governor, Tanko Al-Makura.
The Ambassador advocated that Nigerians must strive hard to ensure that the elections are credible like the 2015 polls.
He warned that Nigerians would be held responsible for what they say or do in the forthcoming general elections.
Nigerians will on February 16th vote in an election that is a straight contest between two northerners â€“ incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party.
