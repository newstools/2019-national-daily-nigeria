R. Kelly might believe he can fly, but the singer won’t be flying out from behind the bars of a jail cell until Monday or even Tuesday. His bond was set at $1 million Saturday after Kelly turned himself in Friday on charges of sexual abuse. His lawyer tells the AP that Kelly is able to pay the $100,000 bail required to be released, but others need to act for him, and coordinating all that is complicated with Kelly behind bars. His attorney had earlier told the judge in the case that Kelly’s finances are “a mess,” and added to reporters that despite his fame, Kelly “really doesn’t have any money at this point” thanks to “mismanagement,” “hangers-on,” and “bad deals.”
CNN runs down Kelly’s money problems, including more than $169,000 in unpaid child support to his ex-wife and more than $166,000 in unpaid rent. Kelly, 52, has a court appearance scheduled for Monday at which he can enter a plea, USA Today reports. His lawyer continues to insist his client is innocent: “He’s a rock star,” he told reporters after the bond hearing, per Fox News. “He doesn’t have to have nonconsensual sex.”
