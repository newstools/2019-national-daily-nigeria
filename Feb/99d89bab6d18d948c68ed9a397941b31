The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has raised the alarm over the circulation of fake dollar notes in the country.

Tony Orilade, EFCC spokesman, gave the warning in a statement issued on Thursday.

Orilade said the agency issued the warning following intelligence gathered in the build-up to the elections.

The anti-graft agency also asked Bureau de Change operators to be cautious.

“The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has raised the alarm over the circulation of fake Dollar notes ahead of Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections,” the statement read.

“In a statement personally signed by the Acting Chairman of the Commission, Ibrahim Magu, the agency stated that the warning follows intelligence gathered in the build-up to the elections.

“The intelligence indicates that the Dollar notes have features of genuineness, but forensic analysis by the Commission reveals otherwise.

“We, therefore, warn the BDC operators to be cautious in their transactions from now till the end of the elections.”
