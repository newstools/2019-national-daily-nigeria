Officials of Kano State Fire Service Firemen on Tuesday night rescued a child and four adults trapped in a burning house at Yakasai behind Rimi Market in Kano State.
Mr Saidu Mohammed, spokesman of the service, who made the disclosure in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria, said that the house was an upstairs building with four rooms and one parlour.
Mohammed added that a six-year-old boy was among those rescued in the inferno.
“We received a distress call from Malam Sani Yusuf at 9:40 p.m. that there was a fire outbreak at a dwelling house.
“Upon receiving the information, we quickly dispatched firemen and fire engine to the scene at 9:44 p.m.,’’ he said.
He gave the names of the victims as Malam Isiyaka, 65, Hajia, 50, Abubakar, 22, and Faruk Ishak, 6.
The official, however, said that the victims who sustained injuries had been taken to the Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital, Kano State, for treatment.
