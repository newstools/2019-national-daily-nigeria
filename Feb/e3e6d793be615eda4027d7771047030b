Governor Muhammadu Bindow of Adamawa State has denied receiving N2.5 billion alleged to be allocated to the a top government functionary, to woo votes, for President Buhari to in Adamawa State.
Bindow said the remark is regrettable, targeted to smear government officials and the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, administration in the state.
The governor refuted the rumor that the State APC is in disarray, saying the party is optimistic of wining the gubernatorial elections.
Mallam Ahmad Sajoh, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, said the government is not aware of the controversial amount.
“Government is not aware of N2.5 billion allocated to woo votes for Buhari.
“The opposition manages funds to buy votes; APC in the state manages goodwill to canvass votes.
“It is blackmail that the failure of some party chieftains to evenly distribute the funds for the purpose of winning the presidential election was responsible for the APC defeat in the state.
“The APC party which Governor Bindow is the leader, is not engulfed in ripples of crisis.
“Funds for campaigns were sourced locally to mobilizing support and logistics for the conduct of the elections,” Sajoh declared.
The Information Commissioner noted that the crisis in the party, if any, might have been caused by “those who took Governor Bindow as an enemy, based on his transformation of the state.”
Preliminary investigation into the alleged scam had it that the baseless rumor was the hand work of people sponsored by Abuja-based group from the state.
