The defence headquarters, Abuja, Nigeria, has warned that any military personnel that is not on duty but found in uniform during the 2019 general elections will face severe sanctions. 
The Director of Defence Information, Brigadier General John Agim, said this in Abuja while briefing newsmen on military conduct during the 2019 polls.
Agim said though military personnel have the right to vote, they can only do so in mufti. Officers and soldiers were again warned to steer clear of involvement in politics and remain professional.
He also warned groups planning to threaten the election process to desist from their intentions, as security agencies will be on the ground to ensure no Nigerian is disenfranchised or molested.
On the controversy surrounding “exercise python dance 3” which is ongoing across the country, Agim says it is not targeted at any particular group of people, but to ensure all eligible citizens carry out their civic responsibilities during the polls in an environment devoid of violence.
