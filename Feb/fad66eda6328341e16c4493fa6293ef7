Former U.S President Bill Clinton has cancelled his scheduled visit to Nigeria, but would speak with the contenders in the Feb. 16 presidential election.
Angel Ureña, spokesperson to Clinton, said that the former president would, however, speak with President Muhammadu Buhari, the Presidential candidate of ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), later in the week.
He would also speak with Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Ureña said the trip was called off because it could be “politicized.”
Clinton was scheduled to visit Abuja this week alongside Baroness Patricia Scotland, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth.
The planned trip was facilitated by the Kofi Annan Foundation and the National Peace Committee (NPC).
“Over the course of the last several days, and after various conversations with the different stakeholders, it’s become apparent that President Clinton’s visit to Nigeria has the potential to be politicized in a way that is not in line with the goals of the Committee.
Therefore, he will not be travelling to Abuja,” Clinton’s spokesman Angel Ureña said in a statement.
Clinton would continue to support the NPC ‘s work toward peaceful and fair elections in Nigeria, Ureha said.
He was billed to deliver a keynote at a ceremony for the signing of a peace accord by presidential candidates.
The CNN confirmed the cancellation of the trip on its twitter handle.
