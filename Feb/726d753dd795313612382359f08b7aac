Urges him to stop Whining but Accept the Will of Nigerians


The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday night advised yPresident Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop whining over their rejection in the Presidential election and quietly accept the will of the people.

The PDP in a statement in Abuja alerted Nigerians that the APC and agents of the Buhari Presidency, being bewildered by defeat, are now plotting to discredit the votes which Nigerians freely delivered to the peoples Candidate, Atiku Abubakar, at their polling units.

The party noted that part of the  plot is to trigger mayhem and burn down INEC offices in order to claim that all evidence of PDP winning the votes have been destroyed.

The PDP reminded President Buhari and the APC that the polling unit is the foundation of the election, noting all PDP agents and supporters already have the results in all the polling centers and voting points across the country.

“1As such, our party is holding strongly to our results as already delivered by the people at the polling units and such cannot be altered.

“The PDP therefore counsels President Buhari and his APC to respect the will of the people and accept the verdict of the election. It is not for President Buhari to direct his campaign spokesperson to tell Nigerians that no party should rejoice.

“For us in the PDP, we already have the figures and we are aware that Nigerians in their resolve and consensus have settled their votes in favour of the people’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, as the next President of our country,” PDP declared.

The party said that President Buhari should be prepared to take his defeat in good faith; adɗing,  “After all, he will not be the first sitting President to lose in an election.”
