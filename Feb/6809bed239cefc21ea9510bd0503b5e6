Although Rohr acknowledged that a good player would be welcome to the Eagles even if he is playing a in a lower division, the German gaffer hinted that it would be better seeing Ighalo in the top-flight.
Rohr assess other players in the Nigerian squad, and reckoned that those who moved in the January transfer window knew they had to take steps to keep their shirts.
He pointed out that Ighalo would need to do the same, as only those playing regularly with their clubs would hold firm spots in the Eagles, but he equally admitted that the former Watford striker has proven his class over the months with the Nigerian squad.
“We will see with Ighalo; I hope that he will change the club now to play, not to stay in the second division in China. He’s doing so well for the Super Eagles, he scored so many goals and has confidence.
”We still need him but also in good fitness. He had a little injury on the knee, I hope he will be fit again and play in his club.
