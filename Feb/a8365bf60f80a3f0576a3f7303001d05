Emiliano Sala’s family could miss out on £600,000 in compensation over the footballer’s tragic death due to a ‘mistake’ made by Cardiff when registering his contract.
The Premier League asked for corrections to be made to the document and Sala to sign the papers again, according to The Times.
But before he was able to do so, he was killed when the plane carrying him crashed into the English Channel just three days after he had become a Bluebirds player.
The alleged error could prove a significant one as players automatically become part of the Professional Footballers’ Association’s pension scheme when they are registered with the Premier League.
And the terms include a £600,000 death-in-service payment to their families.
The PFA will reportedly press for the pension fund to honour the payment as Sala had initially penned a contract with Cardiff.
“It will be for the trustees to see whether they are able to make the payment from there,” PFA deputy chief executive John Bramhall told The Times.
“Normally it would be a simple process but we will be speaking with them on this. Usually, as soon as a contract is registered with the Premier League the player is enrolled on the pension scheme.”
Meanwhile, the transfer broker, Willie McKay, has insisted the deal was “clean”.
“We have nothing to hide, the rumours are f***ing c**p, absolutely f***ing c**p,” he furiously announced.
“I’m sick of it. I’m shocked people are saying this. I’m waiting for the FA to phone me.
“I want a public meeting with everybody there and you can chair it — Sky, the papers, everybody can come.”
