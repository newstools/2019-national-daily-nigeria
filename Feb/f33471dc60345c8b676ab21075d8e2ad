The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) have advised President Muhammad Buhari to ensure that all sections of the country feel the impact of policies and programmes in his second term in Office.
The TUC Secretary-General, Mr Musa-Lawal Ozigi, gave the advice in a congratulatory letter to the President on his re-election.
Recall that Buhari got more than 15 million votes to defeat his closest challenger and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, who polled nearly 11. 3 million votes in the just-concluded presidential election.
“We write to congratulate you on your victory at the just-concluded Presidential and National Assembly Elections. As President-Elect, you are now elevated above partisanship.
“We appeal to the President-elect to be magnanimous in victory; embrace everyone, irrespective of party affiliation and bring in good hands from across the parties to build a country we shall all be proud of.
“We equally rejoice with your party and INEC that we are not derided by observers for incompetence in the electoral process,” Ozigi said.
He noted that it was a keenly contested election, adding that the victory would provide opportunity to consolidate on the socio-economic development started nearly four years ago.
He said that the election was not a case of winners and losers but added that all the parties involved should collaborate to move the nation forward.
