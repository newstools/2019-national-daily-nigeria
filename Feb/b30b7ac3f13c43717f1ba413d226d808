The Wales international has signed a pre-contract agreement with Juventus and will officially join the Turin club on July 1, once his existing deal with the Gunners expires.

The 28-year-old has spent the last 11 years in north London – largely under the stewardship of Wenger, who signed the midfielder from Cardiff when he was still a teenager in 2008.

Speaking at the Laureus Sport for Good presentation, Wenger said: “It will be a loss for Arsenal. I must say it will be an interesting move for Ramsey.

“He is a player who is great going forward. His main quality is he can keep the final ball and he makes interesting runs from deep.

“You don’t find many players today who can make midfield runs off the ball. It will be an interesting addition for Juventus.”

Wenger also gave an insight into how he is enjoying his life away from management.
