Various units of the Nigeria Police have been alleged to be deployed to facilitate the alteration of results of the Saturday presidential and National Assembly elections in Kogi State.

As at Sunday afternoon, a detachment of the Police which include CSP Sanni Mohammed, PMF 37 Squadron Commander, SP Ebenezer Olufemi 2i/c  and Kogi State Command’s DCP Ops, Ismail Gwarzo,, allegedly blocked INEC officials at Katara Village, Kotonkarfi area, preventing them from going to the collation centre to submit the authentic results from the polling units for collation and preparation for official announcement.
The affected Squadron Commander was said to have personally seized the result sheets and Ballot Boxes from the officials and left to an unknown destination.
Our source said that the various Police Units were purportedly providing cover for APC leaders in Kogi State to alter the figures which they intend to present for endorsement by the INEC as the final result.
Inquires showed that Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State is desperate to ensure that Senator Dino Melaye does not go back to the National Assembly in the next session.  Smart Adeyemi is sponsored by APC to take the place of Dino Melaye in the 9th  National Assembly.
 Result filtering in indicated that Dino Melaye is on his way to being re-elected into the Senate for another tenure.
Provisional result from Dino Melaye’s polling unit at Kotoko Ward,  Kogi LG,  showed that in the presidential poll PDP got 283 votes, APC 242  votes;  Senate PDP got  358  votes, APC 169  votes, and HOR, PDP  386, APC 142.
Meanwhile, the Police have purportedly compromised their duties to permit rigging of the elections in the course of compiling the final results in Kogi.
