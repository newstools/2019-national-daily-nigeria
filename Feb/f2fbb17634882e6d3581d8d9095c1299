The Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) has finally admitted Zamfara state All Progressive Congress (APC) candidates into the 2019 general election.
This follows the Court of Appeal ruling on Thursday that the electoral commission should accept candidates of the party.
The state APC was barred from presenting candidates owing to an internal crisis, which did not allow the party to conduct its primaries within the time frame set by INEC.
