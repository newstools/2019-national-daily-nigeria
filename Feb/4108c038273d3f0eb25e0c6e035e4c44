Kylian Mbappe has made an incredible donation of £27,000 to fund the search for missing pilot David Ibbotson.
The Paris Saint-Germain star has helped the campaign to raise £300,000 for the continued search after Argentine forward Emiliano Sala’s body was discovered this week.
Ibbotson was flying the plane that crashed near Guernsey in the English Channel on January 21.
Gary Lineker has also made a generous donation, putting up £1,000, with over 7,000 separate contributions as of Sunday afternoon totalling more than £120,000.
Mbappe, whose full name is Kylian Mbappe Lottin, donated under the name Elie Lottin.
Sala’s own private search was conducted after £324,000 was raised.
And now Ibbotson’s family have followed, releasing a statement pleading for help to recover his body.
“We are trying to come to terms with the tragedy and the loss of two incredible men,” read the statement.
“We can not bear the thought of him being alone, we need him home so that we are able to lay him to rest.”
