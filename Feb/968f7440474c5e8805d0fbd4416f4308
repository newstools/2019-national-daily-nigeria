Merseyside Police are investigating a burglary at the home of Liverpool forward Sadio Mane.
The burglary occurred on Tuesday night while the Senegal international was at Anfield playing in the Champions League last-16 first-leg clash with Bayern Munich.
No one was present at the 26-year-old’s house in Allerton during the burglary.
Thieves are understood to have escaped with watches, mobile phones and car keys during the burglary.
Forensic examinations are being carried out and an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident is ongoing.
Merseyside Police detective inspector Phil Mahon said: “We are appealing for anyone with information in relation to this burglary to please come forward and assist our inquiries.
“While the occupants were not present at the time of the incident this will no doubt be a distressing experience for them and I would ask the offenders to do the right thing and return the stolen items to the owner in any way possible.
“We know the watches in particular are of significant monetary value and I would also like to appeal to anyone who might have been offered the items for sale since the burglary to contact police.”
Mane was previously burgled in November 2017 while he was at Anfield for another Champions League game against Maribor.
