The Independent National Electoral Commission has said that voters could vote with any finger because ballot paper is not finger sensitive.

The electoral agency advised that what matters is that the finger does not cross to the next box; otherwise, it would be interpreted as voting for two parties, making such votes void.

“A voter can use any finger to vote but should ensure that his or her mark is clear and placed inside the box of the political party of his or her choice and does not stray into another box,” INEC counselled.

The Commission said this in response to what it called “fake news” that has been making the rounds, to the intent that voters could only vote with a particular finger.

The information is contained on the verified Twitter handle of the Commission, @inecnigeria.
