He may have been forced to miss the game through injury but Neymar was still able to savour Paris Saint Germain’s Champions League last-16 first leg victory at Old Trafford.
After breaking his fifth metatarsal for the Parisians in a French Cup tie against Strasbourg in January, the Brazilian superstar isn’t expected to return to action until April.
However, in his absence, the French Champions were still able to pick up a valuable 2-0 away win thanks to goals from Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappe.
In a video posted on OTRO.com , Neymar celebrates wildly at home as his side secure a commanding lead heading into the return fixture in Paris.
Despite continued speculation linking him with a move back to former club Barcelona , the forward’s excitable reactions left no doubt where his loyalties lay on this particular night.
Donning a replica shirt with his name on it, Neymar leaps from his seat with joy on both occasions his teammates find the target.
The 27-year old even took time to mimic the famous cross-armed celebration of his strike partner Mbappe after the French star’s killer second goal.
With Neymar’s injury also expected to keep him out of the second leg clash at the Parc des Princes on March 6, PSG’s record signing will be hoping to make a return for the quarter final, should they progress.
The French champions will be favourites to make the last eight after a win in Manchester made all the more impressive given their star man’s absence.
Manager Thomas Tuchel will hope to welcome back Edison Cavani who also sat out the match at Old Trafford with a hip injury.
