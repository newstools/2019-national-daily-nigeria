The vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has lamented about the electoral process during today’s presidential election.


Obi, while casting his vote at his polling unit at Umadimakasi Square, PU019, in his hometown in Anambra State, described the voting process as ‘clumsy and time-consuming’.
He, however, raised alarm over harassment of bigwigs of PDP on Friday night, including himself, describing the harassment as ‘trouble’ for Nigeria.
Addressing journalists after voting, Obi said: “Well, I can’t tell you I’m not tensed but this thing is still a bit clumsy for a lot of people. See the time it took for us to go through this voting process.
“Even the inks were not proper but I still have faith in the process even though it’s not perfect from my experience. However, it’s too early to comment on the election.
“It is true that some PDP bigwigs were whisked away by security agencies, some were harassed including myself. This spells trouble for the country.”
