Former France and Paris Saint-Germain boss Laurent Blanc has hired a leading football agency to help land him a job in the Premier League.
Blanc, 53, is keen to return to English football, where he spent two seasons with Manchester United at the start of the last decade, and has teamed up with Base Soccer. He was spotted at Old Trafford on Tuesday with Base Soccer’s chairman Leon Angel and MD Frank Trimboli watching his former clubs United and PSG play in the Champions League .
The former France skipper played in Italy, Spain and England as well as in his homeland and wants to return to management in one of Europe’s top leagues.
He is particularly keen to work in the Premier League, where his last act as a player before hanging up his boots was to lift the 2002-03 title with United.
The 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 winner has not coached since being sacked by PSG in 2016, despite winning eight major trophies during his three seasons in charge.
The former centre-half won the domestic treble of Ligue 1, Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue in successive seasons in 2015 and 2016. He also won three Ligue 1 titles in his three seasons, but was still axed by president Nasser Al-Khelaifi because PSG lost to Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals.
Previously, Blanc won a Ligue 1 and Coupe de la Ligue double as Bordeaux boss in 2009 and steered France to the last eight of Euro 2012 before losing to eventual winners Spain.
