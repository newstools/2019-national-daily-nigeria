Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he cannot do anything about Alexis Sanchez as he challenged the struggling Manchester United forward to rediscover his best form.
Asked about Sanchez after United’s loss to PSG caretaker manager Solskjaer told reporters: “I can’t do anything about Alexis. He needs to find himself as we know there is a quality player there.”
In-form duo Lingard and Anthony Martial both succumbed to injuries as United were outclassed by French champions PSG, who scored twice in seven second-half minutes through Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappe while a miserable outing for the hosts was capped by Paul Pogba’s late red card.
“The reality is Jesse and Anthony are part of our squad playing really well but in the second half we didn’t have as much movement and couldn’t get in behind,” added Solskjaer, who will assess Lingard and Martial’s fitness in the next couple of days.
