Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has dismissed the rumour about his resignation from office following his absence at the security chiefs meeting with President Muhammadu Buahri on Tuesday.
It was wildly speculated Osinbajo might have been sidelined in the Buhari-led administration.
But Osinbajo took to his official twitter handle to dismiss the report and attributing it to mischief makers, who he said are bent on creating rifts and tension within top officials of the current administration.
He wrote: “Misleading/FAKE news is on the rise especially in this season when Nigerians will make a choice about who will govern them for the next four years.
“I have not resigned!
“I remain committed to the service of the Nigerian people under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari.”
Addressing the rumour at a forum meeting on Thursday morning, Osinbajo said: “There is deliberate propaganda. Today, they’ve been spreading some information around that I’ve resigned.
“They said I’ve resigned; they said I didn’t attend the security meeting yesterday.
“I was in my office… What time do I have? Must I attend every meeting? Can’t the President hold a meeting with security chiefs without me?
“They said I was so angry that they didn’t bring me to that security meeting — I was excluded — so I resigned.”
He went on to explain that he was aware of the security meeting but couldn’t attend because of official engagements.
The Vice President assured that he remained committed to working with Buhari to move the nation forward.
