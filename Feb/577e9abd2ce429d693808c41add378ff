A Magistrate Court has sentenced prominent opposition leader to seven days imprisonment for violating electoral law in the country. The imprisoned political actor was, however, given an option of fine in the sum of $200 (about N74,000).
National Daily gathered that an opposition politician, Tendai Biti, was sentenced to seven days in imprisonment by a Zimbabwean Magistrate Court but was given the option of paying a $200 (£154) fine to avoid imprisonment.
The magistrate was said to have earlier convicted Biti of violating electoral legislation by declaring opposition candidate, Nelson Chamisa, the winner of last year’s heavily disputed presidential election, pre-empting an official announcement that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had won.
The sentence was said to be relatively lenient, but Biti insisted that he would appeal his conviction by the court. He argued that the charges were part of an attempt to crush the opposition.
