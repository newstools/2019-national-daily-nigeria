After reacting to the postponement of the presidential elections on Saturday, which it described as rape of democracy, the governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom Tuesday promised that Nigerians will spill the last pint of their blood to defend the hard earned democracy of the nation.

The governor, who also condemned the killing of APC chairman, Ohimini council, Bonyface Okloho, has urged security agencies to have a rethink while carrying out the order of President Muhammadu Buhari to deal ruthlessly with the electorate at the poll.

In his words, “The military and other security agencies should respect their rules of engagement.

“Anything short of that will not be acceptable by Nigerians.

“It is unfortunate that a President who was elected under a democratic setting is becoming dictatorial.

“We are prepared to spill the last pint of our blood to defend our democracy” he said.
