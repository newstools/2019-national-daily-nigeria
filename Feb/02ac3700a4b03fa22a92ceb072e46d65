Jurgen Klopp praised Sadio Mane for his match-winning display as a surprise centre forward and admitted: “We could never have expected those goals!”
The Reds boss stunned Watford with a tactical masterplan that placed Mane centrally as a deep lying forward, and he responded with two stunning finishes…one a goal of the season contender as Liverpool cantered to a 5-0 victory.
Klopp insisted he expected the Senegal star to show intelligence and mobility in the position – but not the craft of a natural centre forward!
“I didn’t see the back-heel properly, I am told it is special, but I loved the first one – jumping so high, in position, and it was clear he would help us in the build up but we needed him in the box as well and to he was there in good positions for us.
“I took the decision to play him (centrally) immediately (after Firmino was injured) it was the first choice. It was a surprise with the goals of course, you can’t expect him to score like that, but we did expect him to play with movement and skill in the small space in the box and he did that so well.”
The manager also had special praise for Mane’s strike partner Mo Salah, who didn’t score to record his 50th Premier goal for Liverpool…but did take Watford apart to help inspire a landslide.
And the manager said: “ The way Mo played – c’mon it was unbelievable, he was pretty much unplayable tonight. He didn’t score, but he did everything, he was outstanding in creating space and causing problems.”
Liverpool retain their spot at the top of the Premier League and also clawed back some of the goal difference deficit on Manchester City , who laboured to a 1-0 win against West Ham .
