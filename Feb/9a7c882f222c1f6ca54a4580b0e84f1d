Imo State Governor and the Chairman of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Rochas Okorocha, has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his re-election.
The governor, in a statement, by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo, stated the “election of President Buhari for second term could be adjudged the best political development for the nation at the moment because there would not have been any better alternative in the circumstance”.
He also observed that “the way Nigerians voted for him, only showed that he has done well in his first tenure and has enviable popularity among Nigerians”.
According to him: “The millions of votes he garnered across the geo-political zones in the country, only showed that he is a detribalised leader and equally an endorsement of his anti-corruption war”.
He expressed optimism that “the President’s second term will be better than his first term in all ramifications.
Okorocha also lambasted the President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, for dragging the Igbo apex socio-cultural organisation into partisan politics for pecuniary gains.
He noted that Nwodo “has made Ohaneze a branch of PDP and is attacking anybody in Igboland who is not on the same page with him in that unfortunate outing”.
It will be recalled that during the build- up to the Presidential election, the leadership of Ohaneze unanimously endorsed the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party ( PDP), Atiku Abubakar .
Okorocha said: “In fact, Chief Nwodo has, in recent time, used Ohaneze to embarrass the Igbos and pushing them again into a very tight political corner.”
He commended the Secretary General of Ohaneze Barr. Uche Okwukwu, “for the bold steps he had taken to let the world know that Chief Nwodo has gone solo in running the affairs of Ohaneze by making certain statements and declarations in the name of Ndigbo without weighing the implications”.
