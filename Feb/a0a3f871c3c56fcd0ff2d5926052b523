Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in no mood to reprimand match-winner Marcus Rashford, after the Manchester United interim manager jokingly revealed the striker had ignored his orders at Leicester.
England international Rashford scored his eighth goal in 13 outings to earn a 1-0 victory at the King Power Stadium – and secure in-form United a ninth win in 10 outings under the Norwegian’s command.
Rashford’s improvement has come about, largely, after hours of training ground work with Solskjaer – a former striker himself – and the interim manager explained they had spent a long time practising drilling the ball through the keeper’s legs in the build-up to this match.
So when Paul Pogba played the ball through to Rashford early on, Solskjaer thought he knew what was coming next.
However, Solskjaer – who admitted there were things his side could have done much better during the win – was in no mood to tell Rashford off.
Asked if he enjoyed the goal, Solskjaer replied: “Very much so! But then again I told him (to put it) through Schmeichel’s legs, because he opens up.
“But it was a great finish so I can’t complain, can I?”
Rashford’s form has forced Romelu Lukaku to take a backseat as the club’s first choice striker, though Solskjaer revealed afterwards that the former had to play through the pain barrier to keep his place in the side at Leicester.
“He’s played a lot of games and he got a dead leg earlier on but he struggled through it so well done,” Solskjaer added.
