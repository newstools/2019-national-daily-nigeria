A woman leader of a party in Ward 2, PU 4 and 6 of Etsako West Local Government Area, Auchi, Edo State, has alleged over-voting at her wars and that of the APC chairman Adams Oshiomhole.
Momodu Abibat then demanded cancellation of the results of these wards when she stormed the collation centre Saturday evening.
The APC won the poll at those units leaving nothing left for the PDP and its candidates.
According to her,  700 ballot papers were taken out in her unit but only 300 were used. She said her Electoral Officer, Udo Udodo, and the police officer in charge both told her to let the issue rest, but she shouted that nobody should sign the results from that ward.
Mrs Momodu said she had a written a petition and expressed the hope that the matter would be handled diligently.
