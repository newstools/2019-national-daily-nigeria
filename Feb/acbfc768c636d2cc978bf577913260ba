The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has requested that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) reshuffle some of its senior officials.
Oshiomhole on Monday at the APC Caucus meeting at the party national secretariat in Abuja which was attended by President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, 11 APC governors, APC national leader, Bola Tinubu, and other party leaders, accused some INEC State Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) of working with the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Oshiomhole at the APC Caucus meeting declared that he seconded the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in demanding the resignation of the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu. The APC chairman maintained that INEC Officials were responsible for the postponement of the elections.
Oshiomhole protested that INEC knew the elections were to be postponed and revealed the information to the PDP.
He admitted that APC also wants elections to hold across Nigeria at the same time, adding that the ruling party does not want staggered elections.
“We do not want staggered elections, we want all elections to hold at the same time across the country” the APC chairman said.
The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, and all APC lawmakers in the National Assembly were also in attendance at the caucus meeting.
