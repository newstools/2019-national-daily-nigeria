It would only have over the legendary Miguel Muñoz, who surpasses him with four more championships.
The Argentine coach is celebrating his eighth season leading the mattress. From his first match as Atlético coach, at La Rosaleda in January 2012 (he won a 0-0 draw), he already has a Spanish League, a Cup, a Super Cup, two Europa League and two European Super Cups in his palmarés on the bench. (in addition to a tournament Opening with Students and a Closing with River Plate).
The legendary Madrid coach Miguel Muñoz replaced at Real Madrid Carniglia for a while in 1959, but it was not until the following season when he obtained the position of head coach, on April 17, 1960. He held on until January 13 of 1974: 14 seasons. As a coach he won 9 leagues, two Cups, two European Cups (three more as a player) and an Intercontinental Cup.
The fact that Simeone, in addition, has obtained twice the Miguel Muñoz trophythat credits him as the best LaLiga coach
