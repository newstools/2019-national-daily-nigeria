The Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to postpone the presidential and National Assembly elections in Anambra State which has been scheduled for this Saturday, February 16thÂ across the country because of the fire incident which destroyed sensitive materials at the INEC headquarters, Awka, Anambra State.
The State Campaign Director of PDP Presidential Campaign Organization, Harry Oranezi, alleged that the fire incident at INEC was a deliberate attempt to force INEC to postpone the elections in Anambra.
In a swift reaction, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Nwachukwu Orji, said the commission has already received materials from neighbouring states of Ebonyi, Enugu and Delta states and as such the elections will not be postponed.
