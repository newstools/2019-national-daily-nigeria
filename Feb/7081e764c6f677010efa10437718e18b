Gareth Bale faces the threat of a 12-game ban after being reported to authorities for “a gesture of possible obscene and derogatory meaning” while celebrating his goal during Real Madrid’s derby win over Atletico, National Daily learnt.
The Wales international stepped off the bench to find the target in a 3-1 victory for the Blancos at Wanda Metropolitano.
Bale was introduced shortly before the hour mark and had only been on the field 17 minutes before hitting the back of the net.
As the frustration of being named among the substitutes and the emotion of scoring in a crunch clash spilled out of him, Bale wheeled away in celebration.
He gestured in the direction of fans close to the sideline when celebrating after taking abuse from the terraces. His actions were not included in the referee’s match report but have been flagged to the relevant authorities.
La Liga have referred the incident to the competition committee of the Spanish federation and Bale must now wait to discover whether any disciplinary action will be taken.
The sanctions which could be imposed on Bale vary in length.
The statement from La Liga added: “If it occurs, the offender will be sanctioned with a suspension of four to twelve games, or if the animosity is from the public, the suspension will be from one to three parties (games) or for a period of up to one month.”
