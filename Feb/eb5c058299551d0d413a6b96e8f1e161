GERD can be just heartburn or heartburn plus other symptoms, including excessive clearing of the throat, problems swallowing, the feeling that food is stuck in your throat, burning in the mouth, and burning pain in the chest.
 
How do you treat severe heartburn?
Try over-the-counter (OTC) medications: People with heartburn should speak with their doctor about OTC medications for symptom relief. A doctor may recommend antacids, acid reducers, including famotidine or ranitidine, or acid blockers, such as lansoprazole and omeprazole.

How does apple cider vinegar help with heartburn?
You may try using apple cider vinegar to relieve acid reflux symptoms, but there’s no guarantee it will work. It’s thought that this home remedy helps balance your stomach pH by neutralizing stomach acid. It’s generally accepted as safe to consume a small amount of apple cider vinegar. It should be diluted with water.
