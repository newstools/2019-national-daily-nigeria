Samuel Umtiti has put the five senses to realize a dream: enter next Sunday in the list of summoned Ernesto Valverde offer for Tuesday’s game of Champions against Olympique de Lyon. The center is particularly excited about this encounter, since it was not in vain that he formed in the quarry of this club and grew up in the first team of Lyon.
However, the challenge is presupposed for Umtiti. First because in any case it would enter the list without having yet the medical discharge and second because its chances of playing would be minimal. In any case, the excuse that traveling to Lyon could continue with their recovery process when training with the group on Monday afternoon opens the doors to a possible call.
There is no doubt that the fact of being on the list would be a success for Umtiti. And you have to go back to the past November 23 to see the last time the French international entered a call. He was facing the game against Atlético de Madrid in the Metropolitan Wanda where he played the 90 minutes. That has been his last game so far.
Umtiti, who this morning has been at the Sports City working alone, has been reincorporating to the group dynamics for a few days now. Right now it is still a mystery when he could reappear, but it is evident that his return is closer every day.
In the club do not want to take more risks after the ill-fated experience of his return to Atletico where the player returned to relapse of his discomfort in the left knee. But Umtiti is clenching his teeth to be available to Lyon next Tuesday and that ability to sacrifice is also being highly valued by both doctors and the coaching staff.
