The satanic plot to subvert elections in Kaduna State has been exposed by the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, revealing that Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State forges news of the killing of 66 persons in the state to incite violence in order to obstruct elections in the state.
The Zonal Coordinator, North-West office of the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, Ishaya Chonoko, declared that no fresh crisis occurred in Kajuru Local Government Area, LGA, of Kaduna State on Friday, February 15, 2019.
However, Punch had reported that the Kaduna State Government, in a statement signed by Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s spokesman, Samuel Aruwan, confirmed that 66 people died in clashes in the LGA.
The NEMA Zonal Coordinator raised alarm that those responsible for the report want to take advantage of the upcoming election to incite violence.
Ishaya Chonoko had declared in a media interaction: “It is not true that 66 people were killed in Kaduna State. I am in Kaduna now and I can confirm to you that I am not aware of any 66 people that were killed in Kajuru Local Government Area by any unknown gunmen.
“There was an attack last week (Sunday) where 11 people were said to have been killed. It was the usual tribal clash between the Fulani and the indigenes. Anytime there is a clash between two tribes in Kaduna, there is usually reprisal.
“We made necessary contacts only to discover that it was merely a rumour to instigate violence. Please disregard it. It is not true at all.”
