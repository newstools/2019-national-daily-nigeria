A Cypriot first division Anorthos is appealing a nine points deduction for an off-field own goal involving newly-signed star Francis Uzoho, National Daily learnt.
The CFA punished Anorthosis after it upheld an appeal by Apollon Limassol, who had disputed that debutant Uzoho played with an invalid health certificate in a game between the two sides.
Anorthosis, who had won the fixture 1-0, saw that result overturned in favour of Apollon and had an additional six points deducted for breaking the rules.
The points deductions are due to come into effect eight days after Monday’s ruling which sees Apollon leapfrog APOEL Nicosia to top Cyprus’ league table, ahead of the two sides’ crunch game on Sunday.
