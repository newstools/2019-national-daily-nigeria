The Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) has insisted that the collation of the presidential election results will continue despite the rejection of the result by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),   which protested that the results announced by the INEC do not reflect the results announced at the various polling units across the country.
The commission noted that there is no basis for the PDP to reject the results of last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly (NASS) elections across the country.
The Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, said the commission was doing the right thing and would not want to join issues with anyone or party.
“The results being announced are not full of errors, they are valid. We have not concluded the release of the results. We have just released 10 and we still have results of other states to declare.
“So, we will continue with what we are doing successfully and as expected of us. What we are doing is the right thing to be done,” Oyekanmi staeed.
PDP had, earlier in the evening, called for the cancellation of results of the elections, saying the polls were marred by malpractices. The party has also vowed to reject the result.
Results from the 36 states of the federation are being collated and formally announced at the National collation centre, International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja.
