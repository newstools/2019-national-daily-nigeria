Casillas, Porto’s Spanish international goalkeeper, has once again claimed a place in the Spanish national football team. Iker Casillas, who is doing a good job in Portugal, is still looking forward to returning someday to the Spanish national football team he was separated from a few years ago. Iker Casillas feels in a position to return to the national team and expects the current coach, Luis Enrique, to call him again.
It is not the first time he does it. On this occasion, the goalkeeper did it on the program ‘El Transistor’ on Onda Cero. “I feel good and I am enjoying football, I do not regret having gone to Portugal, but I know that the call of the National Team is difficult, Luis Enrique is committed to others but the illusion is there,” said the Porto goalkeeper.
