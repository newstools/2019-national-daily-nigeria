The North Central Zonal Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Maurice Tsav, on Friday stated that Governor Samuel Ortom should not be criticised for non-performance.
Tsav speaking to the News Agency (NAN) on Friday in Makurdi, Benue State, during the PDP Presidential Rally, said that Ortom should instead be commended for securing the lives of his people.
He said that guaranteeing the safety and lives and property of the governor’s people was a milestone achievement.
“To stay alive is better than all the wealth; Ortom gave us life; he will give us security, and will surely give us all that we need in his second term.
“People should not criticise Ortom for non-performance; he has done well in terms of security of lives and property and that is an achievement.’’
He criticised the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government for what he called “leadership incompetence”.
Also, a former Deputy Chairman, Makurdi Local Government Area, Fada Alom, said the massive turnout of Benue people was a clear indication of the people’s acceptance of Atiku.
Alom expressed optimism that the party would win all elective positions at the polls.
