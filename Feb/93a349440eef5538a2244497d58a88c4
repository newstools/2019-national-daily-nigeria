Despite President Buhari’s shoot at sight order of ballot box snatcher, a suspected ballot thieves snatched a ballot box from a polling unit at Ute-Okpu community in Ika North East Local Government, Delta State, Saturday morning, and took it to unknown hideout, despite President Muhammadu Buhari’s warning that such persons stand the risk of losing their lives.

National Daily learned that the ballot snatchers caught security agents, including soldiers deployed to the area unaware.

However, soldiers cordoned off the area soon after the incident, searching voters and demanding that every person within the surroundings of the polling unit show his or her Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs, or be taken as a ballot thief.

A voter, who spoke to our reporter on the incident, said, “There is tension at Ute-Okpu
over the incident, the boys of a well-known politician stormed the polling unit, snatched the
ballot box and ran away with it in their vehicle. There was nothing the voters could do.”

Reports from several parts of the state indicate that there was a slow reading of card readers at most of the filling stations, but at parts of Agbor, people voted as early as 9.00 am after
accreditation.
