Quits active politics

The National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), former Presidential candidate of the All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) in 1999, Chief Olu Falae, has resigned the leadership of the party.
 
Chief Falae, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation during the military era, announced he will no longer be actively involved in politics, citing health challenge as a major reason for his action. He also cited irresolvable differences in the Social Democratic Party for his action.
The elder statesman made this announcement at a news conference in Akure on Friday.
The SDP had on Thursday adopted the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, as its presidential candidate for the February 16th presidential election, while the party’s candidate, former Cross River State Governor, Donald Duke, is still the race after the court judgment.
The party has been battling with protracted intra party crisis emanating from the conduct of its presidential primary.
