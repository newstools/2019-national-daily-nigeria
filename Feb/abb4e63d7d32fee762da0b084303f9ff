Lionel Messi scored his 30th goal of the season in all competitions, during Barcelona’s 1-0 win against Real Valladolid .
In doing so, the attacker has become the first player from the top five European leagues to reach the 30+ goal mark this campaign.
Incredibly, Messi has now scored 30 or more goals in each of his last 11 seasons for Barcelona in all competitions.
Given that it’s only February, it is a safe bet Messi will add to that tally before the end of the season. He could even beat his total of 45 from last year, but might struggle to overhaul his record high of 73 from the 2011/12 campaign.
Barca’s number 10 still continues to amount some truly staggering statistics. This season he has scored 22 goals from 22 games and has netted 30 in 30 in all competitions.
