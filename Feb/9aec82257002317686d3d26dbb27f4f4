The undisputed world heavy weight champion, Anthony Joshua, will fight in the US for the first time when he defends his IBF, WBA and WBO world heavyweight titles against Jarrell Miller on June 1, 2019.
Joshua will take on Miller at Madison Square Garden in the undefeated American’s home city of New York. Records show that the opponent has not lost any fight in his career.
Miller has recorded 23 wins and one draw but has never fought for a world title, and this time, he is going for biggest fight in boxing.
The 30-year-old Miller will almost certainly be the heaviest opponent Joshua has faced as a professional boxer.
Miller – nicknamed ‘Big Baby’ – won 20 of his fights by knockout but Joshua represents a huge step-up in class.
