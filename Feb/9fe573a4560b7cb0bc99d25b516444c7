Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita says the team is fully focused on trying to win the club’s first Premier League title.
The Reds are one point clear of Manchester City at the top of the table following a goalless draw against Manchester United on Sunday, with 11 games remaining.
The Guinea international has made just 12 league starts since arriving from RB Leipzig in the summer, but he has recovered from illness and is in the squad for the match against Watford at Anfield on Wednesday.
“I think from the word go, right from the very first match of the season we’ve all been very focused and very concentrated,” Keita told Sky Sports News.
“But as I think we get to a period now with 11 matches left to play, we all share that same desire.
“I think we are even more focused and concentrated than before. The manager certainly is and so is every member of the squad.
“What we’re doing now is giving absolutely everything in training so that we can take that concentration and that focus into every one of those games that are left between now and the end of the season.”
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has consistently backed Keita to come good and has stressed he is prepared to be patient in order to get the best out of the midfielder.
Keita has nothing but praise for the man who gave him his chance in England.
“He certainly does supply a lot of energy and he transmits a lot of energy and positivity from the touchline,” Keita said of Klopp.
“If we can recreate that energy that he has on the touchline out on the field then we won’t have any problems for sure.
“He has said to us it is never about looking backwards it’s always about looking forwards and focusing on the next games and giving everything that we possibly can and why not?
“The goal has got to be to try and win every one of those games to give us the best possible chance of winning the league title.”
