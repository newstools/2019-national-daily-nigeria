Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the death of Senator Joseph Waku was a great loss not only to Benue State, but also Nigeria at large.
 
Atiku noted that the late Senator’s demise came at a time his voice was most needed in the face of travails threatening Nigeria’s democracy and the country’s unity. 
 
Atiku in a press xtatement in Abuja on Wednesday explained that “the late Senator’s contributions to deepening democracy and strengthening Nigeria’s unity were so immense to be forgotten in a hurry.
 
According to Atiku, “consolidating our democracy and the unity of Nigeria was one of the things we had in common with the late Senator Joseph Waku.”
 
The PDP presidential candidate also recalled that “Waku never retreated to his hole and adopted a posture of indifference while the country’s democracy and unity were under threats.”
 
He said Waku “always came across as a courageous politician who was never afraid to speak truth to power no matter whose ox was gored.”
 
“Having keenly followed his political career, Waku always impressed me by the depth of his patriotism and passionate commitment to Nigeria’s unity,  great virtues for which he will be remembered for years to come”, Atiku further added. 
 
Atiku prayed to God to forgive the gentle soul of the deceased and comfort his family at this difficult moment in their lives.
