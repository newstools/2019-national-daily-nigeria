Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa state has said that he is better prepared to give the people of the southern senatorial district better representation as a senator.
He made this known in Lafia local government at the final campaign rally for his Senate bid.
According to him, after a deep thought and beckoning by the people, in addition to what he has done in the area of development across the senatorial zone, he felt the only way to consolidate and ensure sustainability of the projects would be “if and when I am elected to represent my people at the National Assembly”.
“I am more prepared for the senate than the incumbent to be frank with you, because if you look at what we have done in the past seven and a half years compared to the twelve years of the current occupant of the seat you would have every reason to support us than vote for what is best described as wasted years.
“I want to assure you that my contribution at the floor of the National Assembly in terms of making laws will be what will benefit my constituents as well as strengthen democracy and add value to governance” He said.
The Governor, however, assured the people of Awe that before his exit from office, he will make sure that the general hospital is completed and equipped for full health care service delivery, as well as the construction of a one kilometer intercity in Awe town in addition to the three already constructed.
Al-Makura expressed satisfaction with the turn out of the people to the rally, saying it was most assuring that Awe people will vote 95% for APC in the upcoming elections.
