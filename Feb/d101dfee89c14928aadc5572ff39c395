The National Peace Committee has called on Nigerians not to rise up in defence of the nation’s democracy.
The organisation also worries about the postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission, barely six hours to the elections.
The group chairman retired Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar  and its convener Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah Tuesday night issued a statement entitled “Nigerians: Rise up and obey the nation’s call”.
The nine-paragraph statement said that although the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has already addressed the nation and the leaders of all the political parties, “very little has happened to assuage the deep feeling of embarrassment, pain, and disappointment across the land.”
While praying for Nigeria, the NPC said, “We thank God for the gift of this great country. We know that our selfishness and greed have delayed our march to greatness. We commit our country to you at this very delicate and difficult time. Take control of all the relevant agencies in this election and let your will be done.
“We know that you are a perfect God and that in the end, may your will be done. We commit the future into your hands. Save us from further violence and bloodshed. Forgive our many sins. We believe that your time is the best for us.”
