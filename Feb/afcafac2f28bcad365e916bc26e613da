The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)is still being awaited to cast his vote in the Saturday presidential and national assembly elections. Meanwhile, one of the two card readers at the Unit 012 Ajia, Adamawa State, polling unit where Atiku is expected to vote developed fault at about 9.17am. Thus, only one card reader is functioning and this has slowed down voting at the PDP presidential candidate polling unit.
The card reader was said to be having network problem and the INEC technical team has been working on it. There was no provision for replacement, so, only one card reader is being used for the election at the polling unit.
