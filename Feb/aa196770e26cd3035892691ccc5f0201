Maurizio Sarri has urged his Chelsea players to do more to help Jorginho and hinted that the Italian’s less impressive performances have been caused by the side failing to carry out his instructions. The west Londoners recovered from their humbling defeat to Bournemouth with a comprehensive 5-0 victory over Huddersfield on Saturday, with their manager saying ‘Sarri-ball’ was starting to click. Jorginho is central to his philosophy, but has been criticised in recent weeks – with reports suggesting the players feel Sarri is too reliant on the midfielder he brought with him from Naples.
But Sarri retains his faith in Jorginho and felt he had a strong game against Huddersfield, putting the emphasis on the players around him to do more to help him.
‘Jorginho needs movement without the ball from other players, because he’s used to play at one touch,’ explained Sarri.
 ‘It’s very difficult to play one touch without the movement of the other players. If the team like in the first 25, 30 minutes played very well and we have movements without the ball, it’s easier I think. ‘I think that in the first 25 minutes we played our football. We moved the ball very fast, very well, there was good movement without the ball.
 ‘We were really very dangerous, we didn’t play back to the opposition goal like in the last match with five players sometimes. We attacked the spaces and so I think we played our football. ‘Jorginho played very well. I put [Mateo] Kovacic on the pitch after the fourth goal because Jorginho had a little problem to his groin. This is the only reason because in my opinion Jorginho played a very good match.’
