The Department of State Services has issued a disclaimer of its former Director-General, Lawal Daura who was sacked last year, after mounting a blockade of the National Assembly.
In a statement on Tuesday by DSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, the secret service agency warned that “any person or group that further engages him or his representatives/associates do so at their own peril”.
The service also debunked notions that Daura still remotely controlled its affairs.
Daura was sacked ignominiously on August 7, 2018 by acting President Yemi Osinbajo, after sending hooded servicemen to block the national assembly, an action that provoked national and international outrage.
Daura, 65 years old, was appointed DSS DG by President Buhari on July 2, 2015.
President Buhari later appointed in September 2018, Yusuf Magaji Bichi as Daura’s successor.
