All Progressives Congress ( APC ) Field Operations Directorate (FOD) of the Presidential Campaign Council in Kwara state has hailed the Appeal Court judgement recognising the Hon Bashir Bolarinwa executives.
By that judgement, the court also validated the authenticity of the nomination of Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq as the Kwara state APC governorship candidate.
In a statement Deputy Coordinator, Field Operations of the directorate, Kayode Oyin-Zubair said, “the procured judgement couldn’t have stood further judicial tests. We knew
from the onset that the whole process was orchestrated to weaken our support base and cause confusion amongst our supporters.
“The authenticity of Bashir Bolarinwa executive was today affirmed by the appellate court. Earlier today an end was put to the shenanigans of Saraki and his cohorts here and there.
“We have always held that they can only run, there is no hiding place for them. The
judiciary has shown that it couldn’t be bought, though a lower court judge allowed
himself to be manipulated for a price.“
This is another serious low for Bukola Saraki in quick succession after he was shown a
red card by the people of Kwara State during the presidential campaign in Ilorin.
“We congratulate our party leaders, members and teeming supporters across the state for standing with us since the struggle started,” the statement stated.
Oyin-Zubair therefore, enjoined all members of APC and its supporters in the state to come out enmass this Saturday to vote President Muhammadu Buhari and all APC
candidates.
