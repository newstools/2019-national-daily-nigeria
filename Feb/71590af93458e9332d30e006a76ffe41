Africa’s frontline female singer, Tiwa Savage, has revealed the situation at her polling unit when she cast her vote in the presidential and National Assembly elections yesterday.
The singer said she voted under a peaceful condition, but lamented the crisis and snatching of ballot boxes in other units.
ND had reported that the election was marred by violence and ballot boxes snatching in some areas in Lagos State.
Videos have since emerged online showing some thugs confidently moving ballot boxes from polling units while the electorates watched in amazement.
Tiwa, who also voted in one of the polling units in Lagos State, however, lamented the rate at which thugs operated during the polls.
She tweeted, “Even though it was peaceful at my voting booth, it is still very very heartbreaking to see some of these videos and what happened at some other voting booths.”
