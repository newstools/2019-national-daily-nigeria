The leadership of the Ohanaeze  Ndigbo has intervened in the violent uprising against the Igbo resident in Lagos over the voting pattern in the Saturday Presidential and National Assembly elections in the state  by the host nationality, the Yoruba.

In most cases, the votes already cast were burnt by thugs.

Ohanaeze Ndigbo Secretary in Lagos, Chief Ernest Ozonweke, in the statement assured Ndigbo that the Chief Solomon Ogbonna led group has taken steps to protect their living in Lagos State.
He narrated that since the Saturday incidence at Ago Palace and its environs and other parts of Lagos, Ohanaeze leaders mobilised security operatives to be in alert  at Ago Palace Way and the enirons.
Ozonweke said the Commissioner of Police in Lagos State  has assured that the Police will maintain vigilance in the troubled areas . He, therefore, told Ndigbo to go about their businesses lawfully and  do not take laws into their hands
The Ohanaeze then called for vigilance, telling Igbo sons and daughters to report any suspected unlawful action to the Ohanaeze leaders.
He also assured the Igbo that no one can take away their rights to civic duties from them.
Ozonweke also noted that the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nwodo, has expressed his concerns and commitment to leave and the protection of Igbo life and property in Lagos, telling the Igbo to be good Ambassadors  wherever they are, saying that he is monitoring developments across Nigeria.
