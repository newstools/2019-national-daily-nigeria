Pull Out Of Peace Deal


PDP has declared to the National Peace Committee (NPC) and the international community that Buhari and APC have professed and launched a war on the opposition. 
 
Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary, in a statement Friday night, alleged that President Buhari has unleashed the state security apparatus of the police, the military and the Directorate of State Services (DSS), who are hounding, beating up, arresting, detaining and shooting PDP leaders in various states. 
 
 
He said: “In Osun, all our key leaders have been arrested on flimsy charges. Our leaders are being harassed and detained in Rivers, Kano, and other states.
 
“In Kogi, our leaders, including former Governor Ibrahim Idris was manhandled, our state campaign spokesperson, Mr. Austin Okai, was abducted, while the National Publicity Secretary and Director of Media and Publicity of the Campaign, Kola Ologbondiyan, narrowly escaped abduction.
 
 
“All our leaders in Kogi are under siege. The whereabouts of Senator Dino Melaye, a senatorial candidate, is uncertain since the last siege on him by security agents. The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu has refused to dismantle the siege by Government House Police command in Banda.
 
 
“We call on the Peace Committee and the international committee to note that President Buhari and APC have breached all the agreements in the peace accord.
“For us in the PDP and indeed all Nigerians, we have now come to the breaking point where our members can no longer stomach the escalated onslaught of the Buhari Presidency and the APC. Nigeria belongs to all of us and we might have no option left in the present circumstance than to pull off our gloves.
 
 
“The Peace committee and the International Criminal Court should hold President Buhari directly responsible for any break down of law and order in our country as Nigerians will never allow him to rig this election.”
