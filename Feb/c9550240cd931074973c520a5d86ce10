The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state has planned to violently disrupt elections in some parts of the state.

PDP said the APC was obeying Monday’s directives by the President Muhammadu Buhari, instructing security operatives “to kill any person considered to be disturbing the voting process.”

In a statement on Tuesday, Director-General, Rivers PDP Elections Campaigns Council, Amb. Desmond Akawor said the plan was to scuttle the elections in Obio/Akpor, Port Harcourt, Khana, Gokana, Tai, Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni, Etche, Abua/Odual and Akuku Toru Local Government Areas of the state.

He said, “Among all the sinister actions, the most worrisome is Monday’s directive by the President to the military and police to kill any person considered to be disturbing the voting process.

“With this presidential order, therefore, the military, police now have the motivation to use maximum violence to disrupt the voting process at will and even kill PDP supporters who try to resist the legitimacy of their unlawful activities at the polling stations.

“These actions point to the conclusion that the plot to scuttle the general election in Rivers is real and must be taken seriously and prevented by all well-meaning Nigerians and the international community before it degenerates into a major crisis.”

“As APC continues to take laws into its hands in Rivers, neither the security agencies nor the Presidency has deemed it necessary to reprimand or arrest anyone.”
