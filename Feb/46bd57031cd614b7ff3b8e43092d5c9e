Controversy has continued to trail the purported endorsement of presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar by the socio-political group in North-central Nigeria, the Middle Belt Forum.

While a leader of the forum, Dr. Pogus Bitrus on Sunday reportedly announced Atiku as the candidate for the region, the spokesman of the group, Gowon Egbunu, said PDP candidate couldn’t have been endorsed by the region.

He advised people of the region to ignore the purported endorsement as there would be official notification if there’s need to endorse any candidate.

He said, “I watched and listened with regret, one Dr. Bitrus Pogu, the Chairman of Chibok community in Abuja, on Channels Television a while ago, claiming to be speaking for the Middle Belt Forum.

“There was no time when we came together as a people to endorse Atiku Abubakar as our candidate in the 4th coming elections. Atiku Abubakar is not our candidate and will never be.

“Beloved Middle Beltans, take that as fake news and go about your normal business. If there’s a need to endorse any candidate, you will be communicated accordingly.”

“This is to clear the air and put the records straight, that, Middle Belt people are honest and highly principled people, who will not sell their conscience for a loaf of bread,” he added.
