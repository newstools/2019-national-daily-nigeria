Opposition leader in the controversial elections in Venezuelan, Juan Guaido, has continued to gain foreign support in his struggle for the country’s leadership as winner of the presidential election widely believed to be subverted by the incumbent President Maduro, which has thrown the country into pandemonium.
Guaido has been receiving increasing pledges for international aid for the crisis-wracked country on Tuesday with several European countries announcing new assistance.
The ambassadors of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France met with Guaido at the opposition-led national assembly and spoke at a subsequent news conference.
Guaido said, “$18,160,000 dollars in humanitarian aid and 70 tons of medicines and food,” were pledged by the European nations.
Guaido last month invoked constitutional provisions to assume the presidency, arguing President Nicolas Maduro was re-elected in a sham election and has since been recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate leader by dozens of nations.
Increasingly internationally isolated Maduro, who denies there is a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, says western relief efforts coordinated by the opposition are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup to overthrow him.
