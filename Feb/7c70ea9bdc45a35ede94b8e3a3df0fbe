A Federal high Court in Abuja has declared Mohammed Musa the senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Niger-east senatorial district in the forthcoming election.
In the judgment delivered by Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo, the court confirmed that Umar was the rightful winner of a primary election conducted by the APC on October 2, 2018.
Justice Folashade who granted all the reliefs sought by Musa said the APC lacked the power to nominate, sponsor or forward to the INEC the name of any candidate for election to the office of the senator, representing Niger-east senatorial district that of the person who won the lawful primaries conducted.
Consequently, the court granted an order setting aside the nomination and submission of the name of Senator David Umar by the APC to the Independent National Electoral Commission and directed INEC to list the name of Mohammed Musa instead.
Musa had in a suit challenged the powers of the APC to handpick Senator David Umar to replace him as its candidate in Niger-east senatorial district after he won in a lawful primary.
