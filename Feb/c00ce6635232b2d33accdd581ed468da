Some voters in Buni Yadi, Yobe State, have threatened to boycott election if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) relocates voting centres to another community.
The Independent National Electoral Commission on Friday revealed plans to shift polling units in Buni Yadi to Damaturu, Yobe State for fear of Boko Haram attack.
The community, accused INEC officials of sabotaging and disenfranchising them by shifting the voting centres to the State Capital.
Some voters were said to have vowed that they won’t leave their ancestral homes on Election Day, complaining bitterly that they can neither afford to eat three square meals nor transport fares to the relocated voting units announced by the Commission.
Last Saturday, the insurgents attacked Buni Yadi, an action some stakeholders described as an attempt to disrupt the postponed presidential and national assembly elections.
But the police and civil defence authorities in Yobe State have reassured residents of their safety.
