Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) Luis Rubiales announced a change in the format of the Spanish Super Cup. Four teams will feature in this tournament in a Final Four format played outside of Spain and these changes could be effective as soon as this very same year, Rubiales confirmed.
Says here that Spanish Supercopa to be a ‘final four’ from this summer – top two in La Liga and both Copa finalists, semis and final played in one city over four days .
En este sentido, los dos primeros clasificados del Campeonato de España de Primera División y los dos finalistas de la Copa del Rey se enfrentarían en un formato de semifinales y final.

A ‘final four’ Supercopa interesting idea – Clasicos / derbis all but guaranteed each year – but timing gonna be awkward considering UEFA Supercup / pre-season plans
This is an interesting change which could very well increase the importance of the Spanish Super Cup, often regarded as a very minor pre-season trophy. The new Super Cup would be played just a week before the start of La Liga, which means that the teams involved might still be trying to improve their conditioning.
As ESPN reporter Dermot Corrigan tweeted above, this tournament would almost guarantee some quality matches involving Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico de Madrid and quite possibly a fourth team like Sevilla or Valencia.
This new format still has to be approved by the Spanish Football assembly, something which could happen next April
