Nigeria’s former Vice President and Presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar has charged Nigerians to come out massively on Saturday to cast their votes in order to remove the incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari from office.
 
Atiku, in a Facebook and twitter video on Thursday said Nigerians did it in 2015 when they came out to remove former President Goodluck Jonathan from office, saying that they had the opportunity to do so again on Saturday.
 
“This Saturday, we have our presidential and national assembly election, the reason we have election is to allow our voices heard on how we have been governed for the last four year and who will govern us for the next four years. On March 28, 2015, we the people of Nigeria went out to our polling unit and we were able to remove an incumbent president from office.
 
“That made me very proud to be a Nigerian and a democrat. This Saturday, we will have the opportunity to do so again. My message to you is simple, please come out and vote as this election is about your future and the future of your nation.
“On election day, we are all equal. Your single vote is more important than any other and if you do not vote, you will be accepting that the next four years will be like the last. The power to get Nigeria working again is in your PVC. I will be voting with mine on Saturday, join me irrespective of who you want to vote for,” he said.
