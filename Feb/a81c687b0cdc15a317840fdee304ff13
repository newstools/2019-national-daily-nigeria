Bernd Leno has urged Arsenal to improve their away form if they are to finish in the top four this season.
The Gunners slipped to sixth in the Premier League table yesterday after being outclassed by Manchester City — and hat-trick hero Sergio Aguero in particular — in a 3-1 defeat.
The result marked Arsenal’s fifth League defeat on the road this season — by contrast they have been beaten just once at Emirates Stadium — and although Leno believes there is no cause to panic, the £19.2million summer signing from Bayer Leverkusen cited a clear area for improvement.
“We need wins to go back to the top four but I think we are still in a good position to go there,” said the German.  “We need more away wins because at home we play good and win many games, but to go again to the top four we need more away wins.”
Wins elsewhere for top-four rivals Chelsea and Manchester United mean Arsenal are now in their lowest League position since September 29.
The Gunners face bottom-of-the-table Huddersfield on Saturday before back-to-back matches against BATE Borisov in their Europa League last-32 tie and midfielder Lucas Torriera has warned his team-mates they must bounce back quickly.
“United have overtaken us,” he said. “It’s important to turn the page as quickly as possible. This is football: sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. The most important thing is that we keep trying to improve. It’s about trying to achieve our objectives in the time remaining.
