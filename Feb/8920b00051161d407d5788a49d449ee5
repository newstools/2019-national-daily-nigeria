Some persons suspected to be political thugs have been arrested by security agents in charge of the yet-to-kick off APC presidential rally at MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta, Ogun State.

They were arrested with some dangerous weapon and assorted charms in their possessions.

The suspected political thugs were arrested while attempting to gain access to the main bowl of the venue where President Muhammadu Buhari is being expected to address a campaign rally today.

The President had yet to arrive the venue of the event in Abeokuta, but the stadium is filled to the brim already.

It was gathered that both supporters of the All Progressives Congress and the Allied Peopleâ€™s Movement have besieged the venues in the early hours of today.

It was further gathered that the security operatives comprising men of Nigeria Police Force, Directorate of State Security, Nigerian Army and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence barred a lot of people from the main venue.

President Buhari is currently in Kwara State, from where he is expected to visit Ogun, as part of his presidential campaigns.
