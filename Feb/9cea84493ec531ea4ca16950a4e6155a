Zinedine Zidane and Frank Lampard have been identified by Chelsea as potential replacements for head coach Maurizio Sarri after internal discussions, National Daily learnt.
Chelsea are understood to be very concerned about the team’s recent performances and results – the most recent of which was a home defeat to Manchester United that knocked them out of the FA Cup.
The board are aware of the scale of the problems at the club, especially after the reaction of supporters at Stamford Bridge on Monday night, who booed the team off and slated his ‘Sarri-ball’ style.
It is also understood Chelsea are considering appointing assistant manager Gianfranco Zola as caretaker boss until the end of the season if they decide to part company with Sarri.
Zidane has not been in a job since he left Real Madrid at the end of last season after winning a third consecutive Champions League trophy.
Former Chelsea midfielder Lampard took his first steps into football management with Championship club Derby at the start of the season and has taken the team to within two points off the play-off places.
