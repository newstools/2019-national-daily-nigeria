The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has denied that it has reduced the pump price of petrol from N145 to N140 to encourage Nigerians to travel to vote in the rescheduled presidential and National Assembly elections.

According to IPMAN National Chairman, Alhaji ABK Aliyu, the statement to that effect is false, urging the public to disregard it.

Aliyu, who spoke to newsmen on phone in Yola on Tuesday, said that the statement did not emanate from the association, noting that some people used the unionâ€™s logo to issue unauthorised statements.

According to him, the association does not have the powers to reduce pump price of petroleum products, advising members of the public to disregard it as it a mere political gimmick.

It would be recalled that some people claiming to be IPMAN officials issued a statement on Sunday directing its members to reduce pump price of petrol from N145 to N140 between February 20 and 25 for the purpose of the forthcoming general elections.
