The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has cancelled over 31, 000 votes cast in Tudun Wada/Kabong ward of Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State, claiming illegibility.
ND gathered that the announcement of the cancellation has led to serious tension in Jos City, especially the affected ward.
The rejection was announced by the Collation Officer of the LGA, Dr. Augustine Azi, while announcing the results of the LGA at the INEC Collation Centre in Jos the State Capital.
According to the results submitted on Monday, the APC scored 93,800 votes, while the PDP pulled 53,277.
However, the PDP Agent, Samuel Umar, said they were deceived into signing the results without properly entering them at the Local Government collation centre.
The Collation Officer for the LGA reportedly assured them of rectifying all issues connected to the results before finally submitting them.
Also, journalists who were at the Local Government Collation equally confirmed that the LGA Collation Officer assured of harmonizing the results before submission.
On the contrary, Azi (the LGA Collation Officer), claimed that he only assured of seeking clarification on the issues at the State Collation Centre.
Responding, the State Presidential Returning Officer, Prof. Richard Anande condemned the action.
“That is wrong,” he said, but however maintained that his job was only to receive results and not entertain complaints.
It would be recalled that a similar scenario played out in 2015 general elections, but no public reaction was recorded.
