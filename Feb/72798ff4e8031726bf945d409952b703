A Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from declaring the Chairman of defunct pension reform task team, Abdulrasheed Maina, wanted.
Justice Guwa Ogunbanjo described the action of the anti-graft agency to declare Maina wanted as unlawful.
Maina had in a suit filed on September 5, 2018, prayed the court to determine whether the EFCC can lawfully exercise powers of declaring him as “wanted” on its official website or any other media platform, or by harassing him.
In addition, the former pension boss sought an order of perpetual injunction to restrain the commission from further harassing him or declaring him wanted in relation to the and subject matter of this suit.
The judge said it was done without an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, as stipulated by section 41 and 42 of the administration of criminal justice act 2015.
