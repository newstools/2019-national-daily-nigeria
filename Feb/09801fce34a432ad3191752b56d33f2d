Former youth captain Musa Muhammed has described his performance over the weekend for HNK Gorica in the top-of-the-drawer Croatian Prva HNL league against Hadjuk Split as a good omen as he hopes to return to the Super Eagles, National Daily gathered.
Muhammed, who captained both the Golden Eaglets and Flying Eagles, has only made cameo appearances in the Super Eagles, but has shown sterner stuff since his arrival at Gorica after a loan spell at Lokomotiv Plovdivas.
“I’m really happy with my good form since I arrived at HNK Gorica,” explained the 22-year-old defender, who was Golden Eaglets’ 2013 FIFA U17 World Cup-winning captain.
“The game on Saturday against Hadjuk Split was a very big game because it’s not easy to get a good result away at Stadion Poljud, but fought to get which is good for our aspiration.”
HNK Gorica are currently fifth on the league table, but the dead-ball specialist, who was top-scorer when he led the Flying Eagles to win the U20 Africa Nations Cup (AFCON) in 2015, said he was at the ready to ensure the club secure at least a Europa League ticket.
“We are going to fight for a ticket to play in Europe and I think we are good for a ticket to play in Europa League,” noted Muhammed who plays along with erstwhile Super Eagles defender Godfrey Oboabona for HNK Gorica.
Muhammed has only won only three international caps since the appointment of Coach Gernot Rohr and he really caught the eye with the Super Eagles B side in the Pre- Russia 2018 World Cup exhibition match against Atletico Madrid.
