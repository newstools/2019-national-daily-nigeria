The operatives of Rapid Response Squad (RRS) have arrested two suspected robbers for killing a UBER driver and stealing his Hyundai Elantra car.
Humble Peter Robert, 33, and Gideon Achibong, 36, were arrested on Monday 4, February 2019 at about noon in Aboki Estate, Lekki, Lagos, while removing the car parts for sale to a scrap metal dealer.
Investigations by the police revealed that Robert, an ex – convict and a bus conductor, in company of three others, now at large, had three days before his arrest, conspired to hijack a UBER car and sell it off.
On the said day, the quartet: Emma, David, Dolapo and Robert, at around 11:00 p.m, waved down the deceased, Sunday Obasi, in Lekki, and  told him they were going to Ikate and he charged them N1,000.
Before getting to their destination, the suspects told the driver that they wanted to ease themselves. It was at this point they descended on the driver. They killed him and pushed him off the car into the road before driving the car to Beach Road, where they hid it for two days while looking for buyer. .
According to Robert, “I was sitting in front of the car with the driver. We seized and hit him with stones several times. Emma, also a UBER driver, is our ring leader. .
He noticed that the driver was operating offline before deciding that we hijack the car from him. We contacted Archibong to assist us in disposing off the car. The buyers we invited indicated that they can only buy the car parts.
It was in the process of dismantling the car that RRS patrol vehicle spotted us and arrested two of us. Emma, Dolapo and David are on the run.
