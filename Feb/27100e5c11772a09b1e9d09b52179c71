President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that he would rather wait for the result of Saturday’s presidential election to be declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) than depend on rumours.
Buhari, who said this after arriving at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja on Monday, advised Nigerians to rather wait for INEC’s declaration of the result.
When asked his reaction to what he was hearing from across the country, he said, “I don’t want to depend on rumours, but we will rather wait for INEC to announce the results.
”l hope that Nigerians will appreciate that it was this government which made sure that they were allowed in security and peace to cast their votes for whichever party and candidates they wanted,” the Nation quoted him as saying.
