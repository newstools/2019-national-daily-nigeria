The CD Levante winger, Moses simon made his  second start in the Spanish Laliga as his team fiercely humiliated Celta Vigo by 4-1.
It was a  90 minutes of total action  as Simon Moses played brilliantly as a wing back against their opponent Celta Vigo .
It is a good feeling getting to start  two matches consecutively ,although my first start ended in defeat , but  yesterday we  are able to win convincingly , which is a plus for us , as a team we don’t have a choice than to come out and picked the maximum points away from home.
We were able to subdue our opponent from start to finish,  we were clear a better side than the hosts  which was why it ended in resounding victory for my team.
The pacy winger concluded by saying i am beginning to get more playing time .
