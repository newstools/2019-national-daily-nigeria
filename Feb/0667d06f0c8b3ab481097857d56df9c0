In an interview with Radio Kanal Barcelona, FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has spoken about the club’s interest in Matthijs de Ligt.
The Ajax centre-back is another in-demand youngster at the Dutch club and Barça have been following him for a long time.
After signing his teammate Frenkie de Jong for 75 million euros, 19-year-old De Ligt could be the next to swap Amsterdam for Camp Nou.
Bartomeu didn’t give too many clues but did confirm interest: “We have followed De Ligt for a while. It’s true he’s a player we like, but Barça also have other important players in the squad.
“We will look at more things from March or April. We’re delighted to watch him play and admire him, but there’s nothing more at the moment.”
