The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), before the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria on Friday, had insisted that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) does not have any candidate to field for the general elections in Rivers state. INEC made the statement on Thursday in response to the ruling for stay of execution of an order barring the party from fielding candidates granted by a Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
Speaking to journalists in Abuja, Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, maintained that the Commissi9on has not taken a new decision regarding the matter in Rivers State. He insisted that until it decides otherwise, the APC will not field candidates in the state.
“What the commission has done is that it has taken a position in relation to the issue of Rivers. If anything changes we will meet as a commission and also take a decision.
“But we have taken a decision relating to the issue of Rivers and if anything changes before we take our final decision, the commission will meet and also take a decision; but we have not taken any other decision and we have not repealed our position on the issue of Rivers,” Okoye said.
The State High Court had earlier voided the party’s congresses, saying they were conducted in outright violation of subsisting court orders but the Appeal Court ruling of Monday which ordered stay of execution of the high court ruling was interpreted within APC to mean that the party has been cleared to field candidates for elections in the state.
