Chides CUPP over fake news

The Department of State Services (DSS) has debunked tapping the telephone lines of Nigerians, stating that the allegation by Coalition of Political Parties (CUPP) constitutes fake news.
The DSS Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunanya, in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, refuted that the security agency is involved in wire-tapping so as to interfere with telephones conversations during the elections.
Afunanya maintained that the DSS is committed to its professional ideals and would not engage in unethical conduct.
The PRO observed that the DSS has been criticised by unpatriotic citizens who fed the public with fake news and hate speeches against the agency.
He decried that the social media had been awash with wrong information about the operations of the DSS that were misunderstood and misrepresented.
“It is obvious that some merchants of violence are determined to use their platforms to misinform the public for their selfish and political ends,” he said.
The PRO warned mischief makers against misleading the public, adding that the law would catch up with them.
“The DSS is a responsible organisation and thus professionally adheres to the ideals of intelligence and security governance expected of it in a democracy,” he said
Afunanya urged the public to disregard the claims of the political group.
He insisted that the DSS should be left out of politics to maintain its usual transparency and neutrality in the discharge of its mandate.
The PRO advised specialists in fake news and social media manipulators to always think of Nigeria.
