Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford to replace Luis Suarez, according to Patrick Kluivert.
There has been speculation in recent months that the Catalan giants are looking to the future and want a new striker to take Suarez’s throne.
Rashford has been in brilliant form recently for the Red Devils after being deployed in a central role by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
And Kluivert thinks Rashford would be the perfect long-term replacement for 32-year-old Suarez, who has scored 16 goals in all competitions this term for Barca.
“I like Marcus Rashford, a lot. It will be really difficult to get him over. But he is a good player,” Kluivert told Sport360.
“I don’t see a lot of players who can play in Barcelona. [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang, perhaps he can play.
“There is not a lot. Maybe some players who can play in La Liga, young players. But, for me, I think the best one is Marcus Rashford.
“I think so. He has got the skills, the attitude, he’s quick, he’s fast, he can score goals. He is not always in the first XI at Manchester United and maybe he wants to change club. So, why not?”
