The Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) has said voters for the presidential and National Assembly elections should not expect results from polling units where there were snatching of ballot boxes.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the commission in Akwa Ibom State, Mike Igini made this known on Saturday while addressing newsmen on the elections in the state.

Igini said results different from the ones from the polling units would not be allowed.

“What I can tell you emphatically is that there is no election, where there is snatching of ballot papers or result sheets are taken to private homes or somewhere to thumb print.

“We will not accept it, those things are not going to work here and we are not going to accept it. Those areas will stand as cancelled and we will take them as non-events,” igini said.
