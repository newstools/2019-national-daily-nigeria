The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) provided a communication medium for Igbo nation to ward off any attempt or act of intimidation or victimisation during the Saturday presidential and national assent elections in Nigeria. The service became necessary since the Igbo population has been identified to have the highest voting population across Nigeria. Record indicates that the Igbo voting population from the Niger to the coastal South West Nigeria to Sahara is about 26.7 million. Though the registered voters in the south east clime is about 10 million, political leaders in order parts of the country are aware of the genuine voting population of the Igbo population scattered across Nigeria and the threat it constitutes in the general elections
.
Apparently, the BBC sent out early notice to the Igbo to contact the communication giant on any threat of harassment during voting. The notice in Lagos read: ” if you are Igbo voting in Lagos and you are threatened or prevented from voting please reach out to BBC Igbo Service on +234 809****577″
