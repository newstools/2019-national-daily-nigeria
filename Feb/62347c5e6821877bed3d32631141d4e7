A pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, has condemned in the strongest terms, the political violence against Nigerians of  the Ndigbo extraction in Lagos during the Saturday Presidential and National Assembly  elections.


Odumakin declared: “we frown at
Afenifere in a statement by Yinka Odumakin, National Publicity Secretary, decried that dirty political merchants  and their band of thugs apart from engineering political disenfranchisement  of Ndigbo, went ahead to burn  their votes en masse.
Afenifere remarked that the political vandals they used were said to have been calling themselves members of the Oodua People’s Congress, OPC, noting, “but our checks with the  genuine leaders of the group have shown that the  deragend elements had no affiliation with the  OPC known to Afenifere.”
Afenifere declared: “we frown seriously  at the failure of the security agencies to give adequate cover to Ndigbo in the affected communities as these  thugs went berserk, carrying out the instructions of their sinking political godfathers .
“We want to assure our Igbo brothers and sisters  that the bond of friendship the Afenifere and  Ohanaeze Ndigbo has built,  particularly, under the dynamic leadership of Chief John Nwodo remains strong and will not be broken by the nefarious activities of a few strange children in our midst “
Afenifere further stated that discussions are already going on between its leaders and Ohanaeze Ndigbo leaders on the matter .
Afenifere, therefore, appealed for calm, noting : “these political vandals  are only engaging in death kicks”
Afenifere, then, called on  security agencies to give adequate security cover to Ndigbo in subsequent  electoral exercises  and reassure the country of its sustained transparency and acceptability in dealing  with citizens.
Afenifere encouraged Ndigbo not to succumb to intimidation and harassment by political vampires.

“Our historical connectivity with Ndigbo will survive  the Saturday madness  and the perpetrators will be shamed entirely,  Afenifere declared.
