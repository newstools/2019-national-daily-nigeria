At the inauguration of the technical group in Sokoto, Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole, said, Noma is an acute devastating oro-facial gangrene that occurs mainly in children.
It is known as the disease of the poor.
The disease thrives in an atmosphere of chronic malnutrition, poor environmental sanitation, poor oral hygiene, unsafe water supply among others.
