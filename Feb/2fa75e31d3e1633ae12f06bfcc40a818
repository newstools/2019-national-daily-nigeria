Adrien Rabiot is a free agent in the summer and it seemed like the PSG midfielder had plenty of options. Not enough, apparently, because someone has felt it necessary to chuck Manchester United’s name into the mix.

Manchester City, Liverpool and Barcelona have all been heavily linked with the France star, while Tottenham have also emerged as a suitor. Barca’s interest may have waned slightly since they signed Frenkie De Jong, which leaves the Premier League as an increasingly-likely destination.

AS says United have made a late dash for Rabiot, with whoever is making the decisions at Old Trafford concerned that Marouane Fellaini’s exit has left them light in midfield.

You wouldn’t blame the 23-year-old for wanting to board Ole’s fun bus and Rabiot’s agent, or ‘Mum’ as he calls her, almost certainly likes the look of bulging wage packets they are handing around at Old Trafford these days.
