The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, NAMA, has said the nation’s airspace will remain open before, during and after the rescheduled national and state elections.

NAMA stated this on Sunday in a statement by its General Manager, Public Affairs, Khalid Emele, adding that in line with the directive of the Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, it had earlier ensured a 24-hour operation at all Nigerian airports on Friday, February 15, to facilitate the transportation of the Independent National Electoral Commission’s materials nationwide.

“NAMA wishes to reassure all airspace users and the general public that the Nigerian airspace shall remain open for all airspace users before, during and after the rescheduled 2019 general elections.

“Thus, the agency has put in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure safe flight operations within the period, as well as a possible extension of operational hours of any domestic airport when the need arises.


“Therefore, airline operators, the travelling public and other service providers who are dependent on the agency’s services, are hereby advised to go ahead with their businesses as usual.”

The agency also disclosed that there was no disruption in the provision of air traffic services on Saturday, February 16, “in keeping with the mandate to provide uninterrupted safe, effective, efficient, and economic air navigation services in the country.”
