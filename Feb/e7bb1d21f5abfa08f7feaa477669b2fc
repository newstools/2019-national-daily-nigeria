A study published on Monday has revealed that eating a lot of ultra-processed foods may shorten people’s life.
Researchers found that a 10 per cent increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods was significantly associated with a 14 per cent higher risk of death from all causes.
The researchers described ultra-processed foods as industrial formulations that typically contain five or more ingredients and may contain, for example, hydrogenated oils, dyes or flavour enhancers that are not found in other processed foods.
“Ultra-processed foods are formulations of salt, sugar, oils, and fats, as well as flavors, colors and other additives and are mostly consumed in the form of snacks, desserts, and ready-to-eat and -heat meals.
“Here is a list of some common ultra-processed foods: carbonated drinks, sweet or savoury packaged snacks, ice cream, candies, margarine and spreads, cookies, pastries and cakes, cereal bars, cocoa drinks, meat and chicken extracts, instant sauces, sausages, burgers, hot dogs, among others,” the authors wrote.
The researchers, in the study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, noted that minimally processed foods retained most of their inherent nutritional and physical properties and therefore, offered more nutrients than ultra-processed foods.
They listed the examples of minimally processed foods to include washed and pre-cut fruits, vegetables, bagged salads, beans, frozen fruits, tomatoes and roasted nuts.
