Mr. Deji Adeyanju, convener of pressure group, Concerned Nigerians, has been released on bail by a Kano State Magistrate Court.

Adeyanju has been remanded in a Kano prison after he was rearrested and charged for culpable homicide by the Nigeria Police Force.

He was granted bail in the sum of N50,000 and two sureties, while the court also ordered him to deposit his international passport.

Confirming the bail granted to Sahara Reporters, Oluyemi Fasipe, one of Adeyanju’s allies, said: “I can confirm to you that he has been granted bail. The bail bond consists of N50,000 and sureties with landed properties in Kano.”

Adeyanju had spent 67 days in prison before his release was granted on Monday, February 18.

It was  gathered that the police were demanding to establish the conclusion of a murder trial involving Adeyanju in the mid and late 2000s.

Festus Keyamo, a rights lawyer and current campaign spokesperson for President Muhammadu Buhari, defended Adeyanju and three others at the time.

One of the other three was Musa Daura, said to be a relative of Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari’s nephew.

A former deputy national publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, had described as shameful, the re-arrest of Adeyanju.

“These tyrannical actions will soon end. Nigerians will soon enjoy their total freedom under a government that understands democracy because freedom is an irrepressible spirit that cannot be crushed by the ruthless dictator. Where’s Adolf Hitler today? What of Gaddafi of Libya? Posterity is the best judge,” he said.

Comrade Frank, therefore reminded Nigerians not to tolerate the APC government beyond 2019, adding that, “the current events in the country has clearly shown that this government is anti-citizens.”
