The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, of selling uncollected Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in Edo State, as well as hoarding some sensitive election materials sent to the state.
Edo State PDP Chairman, Dan Orbih, made the allegation during a press briefing in Benin City where he condemned the Saturday postponement of the 2019 general elections by the INEC, which the State Party described as a national embarrassment.
Dan Orbih appealed to Edo people not to allow the postponement of the election dampen their spirit, but come out en masse and vote on February 23rd.
INEC, however, denied the allegation of selling PVCs to APC in the state.
The Edo State PDP also blasted the State APC over intimidation of its members with security agents in the state.
The PDP called on the INEC chairman to write his name in gold by conducting free, fair and credible elections.
