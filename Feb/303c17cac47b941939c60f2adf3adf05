President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress polled 836,496 votes to beat Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party who scored 71,788 votes in Borno, in Saturday’s presidential election.
Prof. Saminu Ibrahim, the state Collation Officer, announced the results after collation from the 27 Local Government Areas of the state on Tuesday in Maiduguri.

He said that the state had 2,319,434 registered voters, out of which 987,290 were accredited for the election.
Ibrahim added that a total of 955,205 votes were cast, out of which APC scored 836,496 votes and PDP scored 71,788 votes.
He stated that the exercise recorded a total of 919,786 valid votes and 35,419 rejected votes.
Ibrahim disclosed that some incidents were recorded during the election in three Registration Areas and 12 Polling Units at Abadam, Biu and Kukawa Local Government Areas of the state.
He explained that the incident involved 5,901 voters in the affected areas.
The collation officer commended the electorate, stakeholders and party agents for the peaceful conduct of the exercise.
Muhammad Makintami, the agent of the APC and other agents have accepted the results and signed the documents on behalf of their parties.
However,  Zanna Gaddama, the chairman of the PDP had earlier rejected the result.
Gaddama alleged that the number of accredited voters did not tally with the total number of votes cast in the election.

He further alleged that PDP agents were muzzled by security agents and APC supporters at the polling units.
“Card Readers are not used and our agents were not allowed to exercise their duties in representing the party in the election.
“There is serious alteration of the election results, we reject it in its entirety and we will seek redress in court,” Gaddama said.
