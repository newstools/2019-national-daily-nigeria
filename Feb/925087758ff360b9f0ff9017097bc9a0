Pope Francis will receive the presidents of all of the world’s National Bishops Conferences to the Vatican February 21-24 to discuss worldwide revelations of sexual abuse in the church, which have badly eroded the institution’s credibility.
The summit will offer a chance for Pope Francis to respond to criticism from victims of abuse who say he has mishandled the crisis and not done enough to make bishops accountable for covering it up.
One major aim of the summit is for the bishops to go back home with what the pope called “clear protocols” on how to prevent abuse and help victims. But many are critical that this summit has taken too long in the planning process.
The crisis has shaken the whole world. Father Augustine, an American monk from Rhode Island, said he believed Americans were almost angrier about the church’s inaction than the abuse itself. But Peruvian Priest Jose Luiz Figuerola said he hoped good things would come from the meeting.        
More than 200 prelates are expected to attend the summit. Heads of Bishops’ Conferences will attend sessions with the pope, abuse experts and victims.
Whilst being too short to fix all the problems, Vaticanist, Philip Pullella explained, one aim is for the bishops to go back home with what Francis called “clear protocols” on how to prevent abuse and help victims.
But many are critical that this summit has taken too long in the planning process.
More than 200 prelates are expected to attend the summit. Heads of bishops’ conferences will attend sessions with the pope, abuse experts and victims.
While clear and tough procedures to prevent abuse have been in place in countries such as the United States for more than a decade, other countries, particularly those in the developing world, are lagging.
Francis has repeatedly vowed zero tolerance for priests who abuse children, but critics have demanded more action.
