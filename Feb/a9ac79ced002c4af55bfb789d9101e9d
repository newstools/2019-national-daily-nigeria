Jurgen Klopp reportedly tore into Jordan Henderson following Liverpool’s goalless draw at Manchester United.
The Reds returned to the Premier League summit after the Old Trafford stalemate but will feel it was two points dropped against a United side crippled by injuries.
Klopp substituted Henderson in the 72nd and the pair appeared to be involved in a heated exchange on the bench.
It was however reported that Klopp went ballistic at his players in the changing room after the game and was unhappy with the way Henderson reacted to being dragged.
Sadio Mane also came under fire as Liverpool fired a blank against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s makeshift side.
Liverpool were seven points clear of Manchester City earlier this year but now just one separates the sides heading into the final 11 games.
He claims he is remaining calm about his side’s situation as they head into another big week which ends with the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
“Yes, of course there is pressure. Actually, from my point of view, it is a very positive pressure, but I don’t have to play – I only sit here and say dumb things, so that’s easy,” said the German.
“We all have to learn in these situations, the only way we can do it is with passion. This club, the heart and soul of this club, is passion.
“On Wednesday night we have another chance (at home to Watford ) and then there’s the derby, which is always a very emotional game so, again, passion.
“I get there has been a few too many draws in the last couple of games but, still, we are where we are so let’s go on.
“People can say ‘Man City are doing better’ but we don’t compare ourselves with that because we have to get the points our own way.
“There are different ways to be successful and so far we were successful. That’s 100 per cent true.
“We know where we are coming from and we know where we are – now let’s make sure we use the situation as good as possible and then we will see it ends for us.”
