The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP), in Kwara State has condemned the deployment of Kayode Egbetokun as the new Commissioner of Police to the state at this elections period.
Also, the youth wing of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State also protested the deployment of CP Kayode Egbetokun to the state, demanding the federal government redeploy CP Egbetokun to another state beside Kwara.
Addressing journalists, Chairman of the Conference of Nigeria Political Parties in Kwara State, Adebayo Lawal, noted that although the CNPP is not against the police officer, the change of leadership a few days to the election is suspicious.
The PDP youth group alleged that Egbetokun has an affiliation with the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu, protesting that the CP may be in the state to complete the political war between Tinubu, other APC leaders and notable PDP leaders in the state and those in Abuja, who had power tussle with the APC national leader before their defection to the PDP.
APC leaders, however, told the PDP to concentrate on its campaign instead of chasing shadows. They were of the view that redeployment of top Police officers has been a routine in the Force, saying that the current exercise to improve security in the country cannot be an exception.
Egbetokun is among the new commissioners of police deployed across the country on Wednesday by the Acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu.
