More than 5.5 million voters have collected their permanent voters card (PVC) in Lagos in the run-up to the February 16 election.
This more than double the number of PVCs collected–2.3 million–in Kano, another state capital many consider strongholds of the APC.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) PRO Femi Akinbiyi stated this in Lagos on Wednesday.
According to him,  the number of registered voters in the state stood at 6, 566,136 and urged those yet to pick up their cards to do so before it would be too late.
“There are still so many PVCs yet to be collected at the INEC offices in the 20 local government areas of the state.
“We are also appealing to all registered voters who are yet to pick up their PVCs to do so before it will be too late for the 2019 general elections.
“Ample opportunities have been given to all eligible voters who registered for PVCs to collect them. I want to urge the people to create time to collect their cards,” Akinbiyi said.
He said that the commission was set for the elections, saying that INEC had started moving non-sensitive materials to all INEC offices in each council area.
According to him, the commission will meet with stakeholders on Feb. 12 on INEC preparations for the polls.
The Presidential and National Assembly Elections will hold on Feb. 16 while the governorship and house of assembly elections will hold on March 2.
