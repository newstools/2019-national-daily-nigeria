The Lagos State Security Trust Fund has commenced training personnel of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority and Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps public risk management on election security trend analysis, amongst others, for the monitoring of the 2019 general elections in the state. The agency noted that the training is important to ensure successful elections in a state as populated as Lagos.
The Fund declared that the training became necessary after a research indicated that 72% of Nigerians in Lagos believed there might be violence during the election with over 80% rating the election as high risk.
The officers being trained will augment personnel of the State Police Command and other security agencies during the elections.
