It is now two league defeats on the bounce for Spurs after Mauricio Pochettino’s side fell to a 2-0 loss at Chelsea on Wednesday evening.
Missing a big chance to close in on Liverpool and Man City at the weekend with a shock 2-1 defeat at Burnley, the Lilywhites lost further ground in the title race at Stamford Bridge.
Pedro opened the scoring for the hosts with his low strike going through Hugo Lloris’ legs, before Kieran Trippier’s embarrassing own goal in the 84th minute clinched the points for the Blues.
There looked to be no danger as Olivier Giroud’s header failed to find a Chelsea teammate, yet the England right-back knocked the ball past Lloris with the Frenchman rushing off his line.
Speaking in the BT Sport studio after the defeat, ex-Manchester United man Rio Ferdinand revealed which player is to blame for the own goal.
“As a defender, in the defender’s union, I blame the goalkeeper,” he said on BT Sport. “Edwin Van Der Sar got an earful.
“Olivier Giroud got a great assist. Here you can see he looks Trippier, his head goes down, and he doesn’t look again.
“He sees the goalkeeper on his line, head to the left head to the right, goalkeeper is on his line, keep the distance between where you are so there’s no problem. And then you can clear the ball.
“The moment Lloris comes off his line, where there is no pressure on Trippier at all, you confuse the whole situation and then you get an own goal.
“Communication on both goals is missing.
“Lloris can see everything there, scream at your defender and take over the situation and you don’t have mistakes like that.”
