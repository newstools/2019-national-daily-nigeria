The Association of White Witches in Nigeria (AWWN) has revealed how the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, can defeat President Muhammadu Buhari of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the February 16 presidential election.
The White Witches Association, after a prolonged meeting at Obudu, Cross River State, cautioned Atiku Abubakar not to repeat the mistake of former President Goodluck Jonathan but adhere to their counsel if he wants to win the February presidential election.
The witches through their spokesperson, Dr. Okhue Iboi, noted that former President Jonathan refused to listen to the “wise”, an action, he said, that led to his defeat in 2015 by President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC.
Dr. Okhue Iboi was gathered to have warned in a media interaction that Atiku must listen to instructions if he wants to defeat Buhari during the presidential election.
The AWWN noted that they had counseled that for the former Vice President to win, he had to undertake the assignment of visiting the church, mosque, and the witches’ association for special prayers.
Oboi had stated: “These three spiritual places are keys in this year’s election. He has to go to these three places for special prayers to be offered on him. If he fails to do so and chooses to follow the way of Jonathan, then, he should forget the presidency.
“In 2015, we told President Jonathan the same thing, but he refused and we all know what happened after that. Millions of Nigerians want Atiku to be the next president, but he has this assignment to undertake so that God can clear his way to win the election.”
Iboi had remarked that during their meeting held in Cross River State in the first week of December 2018, it was clear that the gods favoured Atiku to be the next president of Nigeria but he must seek spiritual covering.
“Atiku will win Buhari with a landslide if he obeys this simple instruction,” he said.
