National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Saturday said if at the end of the presidential election, his party is voted out he would accept the outcome.

Incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari is seeking re-election on the platform of the APC with major opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, contesting as his chief opponent in the ongoing presidential elections across the country.

Speaking on the contest after casting his vote at Polling Unit 047, Ward 3, Ikeja, Tinubu expressed optimism APC will emerge victorious at the end of the election.

He however said if in any case “my party is voted out in this election, I will accept it because it is the people’s verdict that is their decision. Any democrat that cannot accept a result from a free and fair election is not worthy of that name.”

He said, “As a true democrat, you must be able to accept the results of a free and fair election.

“My hope and determination of my party are that we are winning this election because we have the support of the masses and if you look at our rallies, it is an indication of our party’s popularity.

“We are not talking about the elites or those that are rich, but the poor masses, farmers, traders, artisans and the common man who seek for continuity.

On the conduct of the polls he said, “The election has been successful so far, so good. It has demonstrated the resilience of the people and like the President has said; we have chosen the best way in a difficult way.

“Democracy is the toughest way of selecting a leader but the best system. With the resilience of the people and strong determination we are getting there.”
