The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, has condemned Presidential candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, for his objection to the directive given by the president for security forces to deal ruthlessly with ballot box snatchers during the forthcoming elections in the country.

Atiku had accused President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, of encouraging extra- judicial killings by insinuating that ballot box snatchers would pay with their lives.

In response to the statement made by Atiku, Buratai, on Wednesday said Atiku’s response was most ill-fated given that he was a top ranking member in the government beforehand and recognizes that the Nigerian Army and the military, are meant to obey the President’s order to the letter.

The Army chief, therefore, insisted, that they will execute Buhari’s latest order without concession.

Speaking at a meeting held with Principal Staff Officers, General Officers Commanding and Brigade Commanders ahead of the polls billed to commence this Saturday, Buratai cautioned politicians alongside their supporters against testing the army’s will, vowing that those offenders will be treated according to President Buhari’s directive.

The army chief disclosed that personnel linked to retired Army Generals, including those who have become politicians will be withdrawn, pointing out that no political actors will be allowed army escort.

He warned officers against playing partisan roles and demanded the former Vice President to withdraw the statement and offer an apology for attempting to woo the army against what he called “constituted authority”.

Meanwhile, the National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, also lashed out at Atiku on Tuesday night, saying Atiku’s attack on the presidential directive to security operatives to tackle ballot box snatching during this weekend’s polls is equivalent to seeking protection for thugs and setting the country on fire.
