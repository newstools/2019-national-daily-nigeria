The Nigerian Electricity Commission (NERC) has revealed there is a divergence between generated capacity and transmitted and distributed capacity.
NERC blamed both the Nigerian electricity distribution companies (DisCos) and Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) as being the weak links in the Nigerian electricity supply chain, saying they are to be blamed for the electricity crisis Nigeria.
This was disclosed in a communiqué issued at the end of the third Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) stakeholders meeting, where the commission said it identified “a mismatch between the Transmission Service Provider (TSP) and the electricity distribution companies (DisCos) at their interface points” which has led to the sub-optimal dispatch of generated capacity of GenCos and other communication challenges.
Electricity generating capacity has increased in Nigeria to 7,000 megawatts, however constraints in both transmission and distribution networks see these dropping to 4,000 megawatts.
To address this mismatch on the part of the DisCos, the commission said it expects all the DisCos to submit details of transmission challenges limiting the off-take of energy as well as matching projects being implemented by the DisCos to improve throughput of the energy. The submissions shall include delivery timelines and impact on service delivery.
TCN, on the other hand, was directed to submit a report of specific transmission projects being undertaken for the purpose of debottlenecking the supply of electricity to load clusters and timelines for completion by February 15, 2019.
“NERC shall convene special one-on-one sessions with TCN and the DisCos on interface issues to ensure an alignment of TCN investments with DisCos’ needs and anticipated load growth,” the commission said.
“NERC shall also develop a project summary template based on presentations made by each DisCo on interface challenges with TCN and a work plan developed to facilitate the monitoring of the critical projects being implemented by DisCos and TCN.”
Another issue focused upon at the meeting by NERC was the communication of planned outage schedules to electricity customers and the timely response to customer complaints.
NERC added that “a tripartite Committee shall be facilitated by the commission comprised of the DisCos, consumer groups and their respective host states for the purpose of enhancing better relationships between the stakeholders and pursuit of lasting solutions to potential conflict situations that may arise with operators, including customer restiveness, information asymmetry and other related matters.”
Also, improvement in power generation might not trickle down to the customers because investment is lacking in the sector.
