The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) says the scanty attendance at the presidential rally of the All Progressives Congress at the Eagle Square, Abuja on Wednesday is a proof that the party has been rejected by Nigerians.

This was contained in a statement by the party spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, following the APC presidential campaign rally in Abuja on Wednesday which reportedly witnessed scanty attendance.

The party described the development as “a parody and a further indication to President Muhammadu Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) that Nigerians have rejected them ahead of Saturday’s presidential election.”

“The scanty attendance to most of President Buhari’s rallies in various parts of the country has further revealed that the APC only fabricated figures in their claims that 14.8 members of the APC voted for him at the flawed convention.

“Nigerians can now further see that the figures were concocted by APC leaders to give an impression that President Buhari has massive support across the country, as well as use it as basis to allocate fictitious figures for him in the presidential election.

“President Buhari, who was pelted by Nigerians at his campaign rally in Ogun State on Monday, again slurred at the Abuja rally and, as usual, could not even articulate any meaningful message for his very scanty audience at the Eagle Square in Abuja.

“The PDP says the failed rallies, should serve as an ample signal to President Buhari and the APC that Nigerians have moved ahead in rallying with the people’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and no amount of enticement or intimidation can change that resolve,” statement read in part.

The PDP then called on “compromised officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and our security agencies to note the tide and extricate themselves from any form of entanglement or pact to rig the elections for President Buhari, as they will be doing so at their own peril.”
