Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries FC forward Adeniji Adewole Kabir says the Olukoya Boys will not consider themselves superior when they host Niger Tornadoes this weekend.
MFM will face Tornadoes this Sunday in Matchday 8 of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) at the Soccer Temple, Agege Stadium.
This meeting will be the seventh for both teams. The hosts won all their home games scoring eight goals with three clean sheets. Tornadoes won their three home matches with seven goals but conceded in one of the encounters.
The Minna-based team are currently not finding things easy in the NPFL this season. They have played seven league games this season and managed to amass six points. MFM on the hand are currently occupying the first position on the log with 12 points from six matches but Adeniji still believes that the visitors are not pushovers.
“Our match against Niger Tornadoes will be a tough one. Yes we are on top of the table but we don’t have to look down on them because they are not doing well. We need to prove to them that we are champions, that we can go and win away and come back to our home and win.
“Our coach Fidelis Ilechukwu tells us always that we have to be the best every time. So we want to make history for ourselves,” he stated.
The former Stationary Stores striker who has scored three goals in six appearances this season for the Lagos-based team further revealed to  National Daily that why the victory over the visitors is non-negotiable.
“This Sunday’s match is very important to us and the three points is very key, we need to grab it to remain at the top because Katsina United are number two on the table so we need to win.”
