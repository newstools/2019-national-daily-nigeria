Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos could find himself in hot water with UEFA, after controversially hinting that he got intentionally booked in their Champions League clash with Ajax.
The experienced defender was yellow carded in the 89th minute of Real Madrid’s 2-1 win in the Netherlands, in the first leg of their last 16 tie.
That means he will now miss the return game in Madrid after accumulating three cautions in European action this season.
However his disciplinary slate will then be wiped clean and he will be free to play in the later rounds, should they qualify.
The outspoken centre half left much to be desired when questioned on the incident after the game.
“Looking at the result, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t force it (the booking).
“It is something I was thinking about during the game.”
However his comments are likely to be looked into by Europe’s governing body, after team mate Dani Carvajal was given an additional ban for making similar comments following a Champions League game last season.
