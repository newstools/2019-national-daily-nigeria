The Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) has expressed displeasure over attempts by the All Progressives Congress (APC) government to obstruct the campaign rally of its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.
The PDP leaders noted that the party had earlier scheduled its presidential campaign to hold in Abuja on Saturday but they were denied access to the Old Parade Ground by the government.
The PDP, accordingly, warned that it will not tolerate what it terms the oppression of its Presidential candidate in the build up to the 2019 general elections.
