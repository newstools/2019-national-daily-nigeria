Endorsements have continued to pour in for the two leading presidential candidate in the February 16, 2019, presidential election in Nigeria. The Presidential candidate of the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Waziri Adamawa, has continued to get more support in the South East, Nigeria.
A socio-political group, the Eastern Peoples’ Front, EPF, has declared the support of the members and their followers for the Atiku/Obi presidential joint ticket, insisting that their proposals suit the ideals of Ndigbo.
National coordinator of Eastern Peoples Front, Ken Emechebe, and Nigeria’s former Minister of Power, Professor Chinedu Nebo, said in Enugu, Enugu State, that Ndigbo has chosen to support the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate who they believe will right the injustices of the present All Progressives Congress, APC, Government.
The group condemned those it called renegades of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo for distancing themselves from an earlier decision of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation which endorsed the candidature of Atiku/Obi.
The Eastern Peoples’ Front said that those who visited the President to counter Ohanaeze Ndigbo were on commercial business.
The Eastern Peoples’ Front appealed to the about 26.7 million registered Igbo voters across Nigeria to troop out in their numbers and vote for Atiku and Obi on February 16 to make a clear statement on the Nigerian polity.
