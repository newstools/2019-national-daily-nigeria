Former Super Eagles captain, Joseph Yobo has urged the national team coach, Gernot Rohr shouldn’t bother to invite big name players to next month’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles on home soil, National Daily learnt.
The Super Eagles have booked their place already after beating Libya home and away.
“The game is not as important as it’s meant to be. So I want the coach to call up fringe players and up and coming youngsters so that they can also showcase their talent.
“The team qualififed with a game in hand. It has never been easy for the Eagles to qualify, but they did it,” Yobo told National Daily.
He said the Eagles have benefited a lot participating in the 2018 World Cup and with that, they are top contenders for the title in Egypt.
“They built on their performances at the world cup. Though they didn’t get to the next round they made a good impression. The future is looking bright for Nigeria.
