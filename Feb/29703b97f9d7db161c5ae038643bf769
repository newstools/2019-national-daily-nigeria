A statement issued by Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), on Friday, in Abuja, dismissed Wike’s claims and urged Nigerians to do same.
The Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) has denied the reports that there are plans by the federal government to shut down internet services across the country for the 2019 elections.
The NSA, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), noted that the allegation by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State that there are plans by the federal government to shut down internet services across the country as part of plots to rig the 2019 general elections is misinformation.
Accordingly, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), in a statement in Abuja, dismissed Wike’s allegation, telling Nigerians to disregard the allegation as well.The NSA declared: “The attention of the Office of the National Security Adviser has been drawn to the allegation making the rounds in the media that the Federal Government, through the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), has directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to work with internet service providers to shut down internet access during the forthcoming elections to facilitate rigging of the 2019 elections. The office wishes to advise the general public to disregard the allegation which is disinformation.
“This office wishes to state that the internet and associated communications infrastructure are major components of the Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII), which the ONSA is mandated to ensure its security.“Accordingly, the office, in collaboration with relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government, makes continuous efforts to protect them and improve service delivery to Nigerians.“Furthermore, every single national security platform in the country rides on the same internet to function. Therefore, ‘shutting down’ the internet is akin to shutting down national development and security.“The Office of the National Security Adviser remains committed to protecting the rights of the public to access Information and Communication Technology facilities. The office also remains non-partisan and committed to ensuring that Nigerians freely exercise their civic rights.”
