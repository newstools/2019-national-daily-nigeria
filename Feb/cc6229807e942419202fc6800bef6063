The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has sued President Muhammadu Buhari over his controversial statement that ballot box snatchers would pay with their lives.




In a suit filed before the Federal High Court in Abuja, the party asked the court to declare Buhari’s directive is unconstitutional, unlawful and void.

The party also sued Mohammed Bello, minister of the federal capital territory (FCT), before a FCT high court over the “gigantic broom” erected by the All Progressives Congress (APC) near Abuja city gate.

It urged the court to issue an order compelling the minister to investigate allegations of intimidation and illegality which poses potential threat of violence and disunity the structure may cause.

The party said this follows the permission of the FCT administration or its failure to take action against the broom which it said is an “improper structure”.

On Monday, President Buhari had said, “I really gave the military and police order to be ruthless.

“Anybody who thinks he has enough influence in his locality to lead a body of thugs to snatch ballot boxes or disturbs the voting system, will do so at the expense of his own life.”
