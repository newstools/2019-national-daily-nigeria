An Ado-Ekiti High Court on Thursday sentenced two men, Oluwayomi Adedayo, 27, and Seyi Daramola, 23, to death for armed robbery.

Justice John Adeyeye held that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and consequently, found the duo guilty as charged.

It was  reported that the convicts carried out a robbery activity with guns on or about August 4, 2016 at Club 15, Dynamic Lounge, Irewumi, Opp. Bawa Estate Road in Ado Ekiti.


The convicts were first arraigned on October 16, 2017 on two charges of armed robbery and conspiracy but they pleaded not guilty.

The Prosecutor, Sgt. Ekijah Adejare, told the court that an eye-witness whose name was not provided at the court, said that some robbers came to their club with guns and other dangerous weapons and robbed them of their valuables, including phones, laptops and cash.


“But they were arrested when they went to sell the items, particularly the laptops and phones when they could not provide the passwords,” the prosecution stated.

The prosecution, represented by Mr Felix Awoniyi, to prove its case, called six witnesses and tendered exhibits, including the two laptops and statements from the two convicts.

The convicts were represented by Mrs Toyin Oluwole.
