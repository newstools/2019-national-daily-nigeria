The police in Niger State have arrested four suspected kidnappers terrorising Fota village in Lapai Local Government.
The suspected kidnappers, Mohammed Abubakar, Mamuda Mohammed, Mohammed Mohammed and Amadu Garba, confessed that the ransom they got from their victims made them to live big.
The suspects met their Waterloo after one of their kidnapped victims, Sani Dakuma, escaped from their den.
It was learnt that the suspects had kidnapped the father of Sani and collected N1.5 million as ransom before his release.
Speaking to reporters when paraded in Minna by the police, one of the suspects, Mamuda Mohammed, said they made a lot of money from kidnapping, adding that they used the ransom to marry many wives and live big.
“We have been making a lot of money from our victims. Whenever we kidnapped them, the ransom paid was quite rewarding to the extent that we could compare ourselves with directors in the ministries.
“We swim in cash, marry many wives and lavish money on our girlfriends. Honestly, we never knew that our cups would become full until we found ourselves in the police net,” he said.
Police spokesman Muhammad Abubakar said the suspects were trailed and apprehended following a tip-off by officers attached to Lapai Divisional Office.
He said the suspects have admitted to committing the offence, adding that the matter has been charged to court.
