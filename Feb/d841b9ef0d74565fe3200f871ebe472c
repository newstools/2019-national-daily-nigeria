The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has condoled with the people of Anambra State over a petrol tanker fire incident that took many lives in the state.
Atiku’s condolence message was contained in a press release signed by the PDP Vice Presidential candidate and former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi on Sunday.
Atiku noted that he “received with shock and sadness news of the tragic incident in which a petrol tanker exploded last night in Amawbia near Awka.”
He further stated that he was “briefed that several lives were lost, many persons injured and a good number of shops were razed in the ensuing inferno.”
Obi had declared in the statement: “On behalf of myself and our incoming President, Alhaji Abubakar, please accept my deepest condolences to the families and friends of all those who may have lost a dear one and to the government and good people of Anambra State.”
He prayed that God grants families of the deceased the comfort and strength to bear the loss.
Atiku, however, called on the relevant authorities in Anambra State Government to cause for an investigation into the incident and to support victims to minimize the impact of the tragedy on their lives.
