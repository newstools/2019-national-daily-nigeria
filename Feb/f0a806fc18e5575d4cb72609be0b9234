Another game, another goal and an assist for Manchester United star Paul Pogba.
The French superstar, once the world’s most expensive footballer when he rejoined the Red Devils in 2016, is finally proving himself worthy of the £89million price tag.
His display against Chelsea in United’s 2-0 FA Cup fifth round victory had supporters swooning and proclaiming him as the best central midfielder on the planet at this moment in time.
Pogba has thrilled since the arrival of interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in mid-December but he did also have some decent early season displays too.
He’s certainly worth his recent praise but who have been the best central midfielders across the whole campaign in Europe’s top five leagues?
