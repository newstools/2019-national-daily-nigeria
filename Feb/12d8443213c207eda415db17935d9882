Belgian Federation warn Awoniyi over religious goal celebration, striker given suspended sentence
Taiwo Awoniyi had been in danger of missing Royal Excel Mouscron’s next game in the Belgian First Division A against Standard Liege on Friday because of his religious goal celebration in the 2-1 win at Gent on February 10, National Daily gathered.
The Liverpool loanee is available for selection after the Disputes Committee of the Royal Belgian Football Association (KBVB) gave him a reprimand and suspended sentence until March 5, 2020.
Awoniyi celebrated his opening goal in the 43rd minute against Gent by raising his shirt and showing a bible verse, ”Fear God. Keep his commandments for this is the duty of man Ecclesiastes 12:13″.
The former Nigeria U23 international argued that he didn’t want to provoke anyone with the action and it was done with the best intentions.
Fifa rules state : ”Players must not reveal undershirts which contain slogans or advertising. The basic compulsory equipment must not contain any political, religious or personal statements.
”A player removing his jersey to reveal slogans or advertising will be sanctioned by the competition organiser.
”The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment contains political,religious or personal slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by FIFA.”
Since Awoniyi’s return to Royal Excel Mouscron in January, he has helped the club win six successive league matches, scoring five goals and two assists.
