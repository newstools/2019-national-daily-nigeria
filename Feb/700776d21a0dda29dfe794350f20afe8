The leadership of  the Agbekoya Farmers’ Society has pledged support for the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar in the February election.
In a meeting with the Deputy Chairman of the party, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, the group expressed their interest in the presidency of Atiku, especially the restructuring policy.
“The hardship facing the farmers are enormous and these can only be surmounted if there is a responsive government who will be alive to the yearnings of the people especially the farmers whose contributions to a nation’s well-being is not negotiable,’ said the group’s National Secretary  Moses Ogunsanya.
According to Ogunsanya, the Buhari led administration has been the worst period for farmers across the Southern and Middle Belt of Nigeria.
“Forget all they are saying about making gains with the Agricultural sector, the present administration supervised an assault on us with the Herdsmen attacks. While we were crying, the government looked the other way,” he said.
“We have read Atiku’s plan on tackling this disease and we are satisfied with it. We also read his plan on restructuring and once he implements that, the fortune of this country will skyrocket,” he said.
The farmers expressed their hope that things will change for the better under a government headed by a leader who can guarantee security of lives and property of the citizenry.
In his response, Otunba Daniel thanked the group for the solidarity and endorsement of the PDP flag bearer in the presidential race.
He noted that the issue of clashes between Herdsmen and Farmers is one that should be of concern to a government that was elected to protect the people.
Present at the meeting were officers of the body which included Chief Titus Olaoye, Sufianu Asuwaju, Baruwa Yusuf, Taofeek Yusuf, Moses Enojiasun, Adewale Jimoh, Alufa Adebanke, Chief Bamidele Olatunji, Olaseni Egbeyemi, Raimi Tunde, Dr. Moses Ogunlana, Chief M. Saludeen and Wasiu Shitu.
