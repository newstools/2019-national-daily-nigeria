Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) warned the Nigerian military to stay clear of the polling units in the southeast during this Saturday’s rescheduled Presidential and National Assembly elections.

The group gave the warning while reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari’s order that the military should deal with ballot box snatchers, describing it as product of desperation and frustration.

In a statement issued by the group through its leader, Uchenna Madu, the Biafra group further the President and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of working with the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to rig elections in the South East using Operation Python Dance 3.

“The leadership of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra has warned the Nigeria military personnel to stay clear of polling units during the Presidential and National Assembly elections on Saturday.

“We condemn the position of President Muhammadu Buhari on his presidential order that the military should deal with civilians exercising their civic rights.

“MASSOB views President Muhammadu Buhari’s order to the military as a wild desperation and frustration, his APC-led Federal Government has failed woefully and contributed much to the political, religious, academicals, economic and social sufferings of the citizens.

“MASSOB and other pro Biafra groups assure our people to massively participate and exercise their civic rights on Election Day. We assure our people that nobody will intimidate them on Election Day. Nigeria’s military has no constitutional rights to appear at polling units on Election Day,” the statement read.
