Samuel Kalu will certainly be included in Bordeaux match day eighteen when they tackle Nantes at Stade de la Beaujoire – Louis Fonteneau, National Daily gathered.
The winger is once again available for selection after serving a three-game ban that saw him miss matches against Paris Saint-Germain, Toulouse and Guingamp.
Bordeaux coach éric Bedouet has advised the Nigeria international to step up his game and found it strange the attack-minded player was deployed as a right (wing)back in an AFCON qualifier against South Africa, Bestchoicesports understands.
”Samuel Kalu will bring some power, because he is powerful, but in the national team he plays right back in a 3-5-2 and it’s funny,”  Bedouet told reporters at the pre-match press conference.
”In fact we discussed, because the game changes between clubs and the national team.. So he must regain the qualities he had when he arrived: power, speed, dribbling, acceleration. He must find it, because it was good.”
In 28 outings for Bordeaux across all competitions, Kalu has registered his name on the scoresheet on four occasions.
