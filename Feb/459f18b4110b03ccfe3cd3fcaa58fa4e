The Social Democratic Party, SDP, has expelled its litigious presidential candidate and former minister, Jerry Gana, and suspended Donald Duke, who the court upheld as the party’s presidential candidate.
Both were said to be involved in anti-party activities.
The party, whose chairman Olu Falae stepped down days ago following his party’s adoption of President Muhammadu Buhari, insisted the APC candidate is their choice.
Another chieftain of the party, Dipo Sonibare, was also suspended for similar allegations..
It also said it was looking beyond the presidential election and how it could ensure victory for its candidates for the National Assembly and Houses of Assembly seats across the nation.
Tunde Adeniran, a former education minister and ex-PDP stalwart, has taken over as Acting National Chairman, but is currently facing another faction that has rejected his leadership.
The Acting Deputy National Chairman(South) of the party, Olu Agunloye, confirmed the disciplinary actions on on Tuesday.
