Krzysztof Piatek continued his hot streak as AC Milan closed the gap on their city rivals Inter with a dominant 3-0 win over Serie A strugglers Empoli at San Siro.
After a frustrating first-half performance, in which Lucas Paqueta had a goal ruled out by VAR, Gennaro Gattuso’s side put Empoli out of sight with two goals in as many minutes.
Piatek got things started in the 49th minute, netting his seventh Milan goal in just his sixth appearance, moments after Rade Krunic wasted a gilt-edged chance at the other end.
And Empoli’s misery was immediately compounded by Franck Kessie’s delicate chip, with Samu Castillejo’s deft finish adding further gloss as Milan moved to within one point of third-placed Inter.
