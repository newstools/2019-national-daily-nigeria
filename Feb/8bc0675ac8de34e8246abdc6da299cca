The agent of the African Democratic Congress at Ward II, Mr. Sikiru Ojurabesa, on Sunday protested the alleged inflation of scores recorded for Ogun State governor Ibikunle Amosun.

Amosun is a Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress at Ward II, Abeokuta South.

Amosun and other candidates of about 39 political parties had participated at the election on Saturday for Ogun Central Senatorial seat in the state.

The Ogun Central Senatorial district took place in six local government areas of the state.

The disagreement occurred at the Centenary Hall, Ake, Abeokuta, the collation centre for Ogun Central Senatorial District as the Electoral Officer was imputing the scores of the political parties that participated in the election.

The process which had been going on smoothly was almost disrupted following the protest by the ADC agent against the alleged inflated figures.

Ojurabesa, who rained curses on the electoral officers, said the score credited to APC was increased from 1,477 to 13,000 between the Ward collation centre and the Senatorial collation centre.

He said he knew that APC won at the Ward level, but that it was not with that margin.

The crisis was still being managed by the security agents at the centre as of the time of filing this report.

Efforts were on to correct the alleged error in the result sheet.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere became tense, and the situation has forced the security men attached to the centre to ask everybody in the centre, except the INEC officials, to leave.

Journalists and accredited parties agents were later allowed access into the centre.
