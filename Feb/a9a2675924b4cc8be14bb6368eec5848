It has been revealed that the first payment deadline for the transfer of Emiliano Sala from Nantes to Cardiff is scheduled for Wednesday. The Cardiff Club is calling for an end to the accident investigation before settling the 15 million pounds of the transfer in three installments.
The first deadline for the payment of Emiliano Sala’s transfer from Nantes to Cardiff comes to an end on Wednesday, according to BBC Wales. Originally scheduled last week, this first payment, out of the three expected for a total of 15 million pounds, had been postponed for seven days. In case of non-compliance with this deadline, the case could be brought before the Fifa Dispute Resolution Division (CRL).
Possible appeal to FIFA in case of refusal.
On February 5, Nantes asked in writing for compliance with this first payment. The Welsh club has said it is ready to pay, but only after the end of the investigation into the crash in the Channel of the plane carrying Emiliano Sala on 21 January. Club President Mehmet Dalman spoke in mid-February of “anomalies” in the transfer agreement and appealed to other Premier League clubs to help him.
A report on the survey published on Monday
Cardiff reacted Tuesday to the latest AAIB report on the survey, released Monday night. “We are very concerned that questions remain as to the validity of the pilot’s license and his qualification to undertake such a trip,” the club said in a statement, “We are also concerned that the trip involved aircraft that did not comply with the requirements of the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) or the FAA (Commercial Aviation Agency) for commercial activity and, therefore, could have been used illegally . “
