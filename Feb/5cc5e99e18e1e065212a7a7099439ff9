The Coalition of United Political Parties on Wednesday alleged that the Department of State Services is tapping telephone conversations of opposition party members in the country.

He said the conversations which were mainly opposition’s strategies for the forthcoming elections were being made available to leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress.

The coalition’s national spokesman, Imo Ugochinyere, made the allegations in a statement made available to journalists.

He said, “We wish to express our shock and disappointment with the All Progressives Congress and unscrupulous security agencies who, we discovered are taping our leaders’ calls and leaking our electoral strategy.

“The opposition has uncovered constant taping of our calls and location marking by the ruling APC, using the DSS.

“We are utterly disgusted with this shameless act. This administration has proven that nothing is sacred to them anymore.”

Ugochinyere, therefore, called on opposition members to abandon telephone conversations and adopt physical meetings or make use of the Whatsapp platform.

He added, “We also urge our members to use Wi-Fi network to power their WhatsApp conversations than the use of telecommunications means which they easily have access to.

“As for the immoral security agencies who allow themselves to be used by this ruthless government, stop taping our calls and leaking our electoral strategy, channel your energy to your duty which is serving our country rather than belittling yourselves.”
