Napoli boss Carlo Ancelotti says Alex Meret ‘reminds me of a young Gianluigi Buffon’ and Kalidou Koulibaly is among the best defenders he has coached.
Meret is considered to be the future of Italy’s goalkeeping along with Gianluigi Donnarumma, while Koulibaly has grown into a mainstay in the heart of Napoli’s defence.
“Meret’s a great talent,” Ancelotti told La Stampa.
“He reminds me of a young Buffon. He’s had a lot of physical problems so he’s a little apprehensive right now, but with time he’ll become more of a character.
“Koulibaly belongs to the category of Maldini, Thuram, Thiago Silva and Sergio Ramos. He’s very intelligent.
“Usually those who are as strong and quick as him think nothing else is needed to resolve problems.
“I divide players into optimists and pessimists. He’s a pessimist, he knows that [pace and strength] isn’t enough, so he’s very attentive and he has a strong character.”
Carletto was also asked about Lorenzo Insigne’s development, given the Italy forward is no longer a promising youngster and turns 28 later this year.
“Can Insigne still grow? No, his growth now lies in finding consistency. You can’t ask for too much talent.
“Ronaldo liked playing on the left at Real. He’d have to work in covering his full-back, but I didn’t even try to make him do that,” explained the 59-year-old.
“I preferred to sacrifice others instead. Sacchi got angry with Van Basten because he didn’t run much.
“I gladly did Marco’s running for him. He’d say to me ‘give me the ball and run to hug me.’”
