Marcus Rashford recovering from injury in time for Manchester United’s trip to Crystal Palace would be a “surprise”, says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Rashford’s ankle “ballooned” early on in United’s 0-0 draw with Liverpool on Sunday and he was set to be replaced, but, with three of his team-mates coming off injured in the first half, he was forced to stay on.
Caretaker-manager Solskjaer told Sky Sports after the game that he was concerned about leaving Rashford on to play the full 90 minutes, but said the striker was a “warrior” for his team.
United, who dropped out of the top four after Arsenal beat Southampton, go to Palace on Wednesday and are unlikely to have Rashford in their squad.
Solskjaer, speaking at his post-match news conference said: “I haven’t seen him after the game or after he had treatment. If he plays, I’ll be surprised.
“He did his ankle straight away. We should have taken him off straight away, but we couldn’t. We played with 10-and-a-half men, but Rashford’s attitude made up for it as well.”
Ander Herrera, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata came off in the first 43 minutes against Liverpool, leaving Solskjaer to say “he had never seen the like of this before”. He offered no update on their fitness, though.
United, who were already without Nemanja Matic and Anthony Martial, have nine players out injured.
But Solskjaer refused to be disheartened, telling Sky Sports: “We’ve got some good kids coming through.
“We’ll have 11 players on the pitch on Wednesday night. Luckily we’ve got two days recovery!”
