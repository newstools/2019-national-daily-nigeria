The senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Shehu Sani, has vowed that he cannot be a sportsman in an election where there was no contest.
Shehu Sani who was addressing members of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Kaduna, said the conduct of the 2019 general elections falls short of expectations.
The senator complained that elections in most parts of Kaduna State were characterized by irregularities.
Shehu Sani, therefore, called for the outright cancellation of the election in Kaduna state.
