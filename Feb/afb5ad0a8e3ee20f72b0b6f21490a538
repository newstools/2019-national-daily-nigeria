The EFCC operatives have staked out the Lagos State Collation Centre for the Presidential Election, situated at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) headquarters office, Yaba.
No fewer than  10 officials  entered INEC premises before 10:00pm on Saturday night and sat under the canopy erected for the collation of Presidential results across the 20 local government areas of the state.
The operatives, who were wearing their aprons with EFCC inscriptions sat quietly awaiting the commencement of the final collation exercise in the state.
There are speculations the operatives were on ground to tackle the menace of vote selling and buying.
Meanwhile, collations of the Presidential and National Assembly elections are ongoing in many centres and no results from any local government areas of the state has reached the final state collation centre in INEC office.
However, the venue was  scanty as at 12:00 midnight with some journalists and many security agents going in and out of the premises.
The final collation for the Presidential elections in the state may be delayed till Sunday morning.
Many Registration Area Collation Officers in the Lagos Mainland Federal Constituency collation centre situated at St. Agnes Primary School, Birrel in Yaba, next fence to INEC office, were still busy with the exercise.
