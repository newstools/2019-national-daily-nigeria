Lawrence Akpomiemie,    special adviser on youth development, was reportedly shot dead at 10pm by gunmen at Ekpan in the Uvwie Local Government Area of the state on Friday.

Ni fewer than 10 persons have been killed so far. Also, scores of persons have been injured and maimed in the crisis.
Akpomiemie was ambushed by arms-wielding youths while returning from an outing with a lady suspected to be his girlfriend.

Investigations linked Ngozi’s murder to the lingering political crisis in Ekpan between supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress.
