A one-day conference organised by the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation is bringing together stakeholders from all over Africa to discuss ways of preventing election-related violence on the continent.
The conference is tagged Peaceful Elections and National Development, and will be held in Abuja on February 7, under the chairmanship of a former Head of State, Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar.
Abdulsalami is the chairman of the National Peace Committee.
 
In a statement on Saturday, the Acting Director-General of the foundation, David Akuta, said the programme was in line with GJF’s mission of striving to consolidate democracy and peaceful political transitions in Africa.
He said personalities such as the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Hassan Kukah; Liberian Ambassador to Nigeria, Prof Al-Hassan Conteh, and Fidele Sarassoro,  Chief of Staff to the President of Cote d’Ivoire,   would present papers  at the event.
Akuta stressed that the conference was necessary because many African countries were due for general and legislative elections in 2019, adding that it would seek to proffer solutions to the crisis that often characterised political transitions in Africa.
