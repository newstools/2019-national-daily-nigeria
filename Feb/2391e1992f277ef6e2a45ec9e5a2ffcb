The Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State, Shehu Isah, has denied the allegations against him by the governorship candidate of the National Rescue Movement (NRM), Senator Saidu Dansadau, that he led security agencies and political thugs to destroy election materials in Saturday’s presidential and national assembly elections, saying it is falsehood and baseless.
Isah in media interaction in Gusau, Zamfara State, on the conduct of the elections dismissed the allegations made by Senator Dansadau, saying that the military does not take sides with any political party, pointing out that the military did not participate in the elections.
Isah observed that the conduct of the 2019 presidential and national assembly elections was peaceful in spite of the pockets of hitches witnessed in some parts of the state. He stated that no process is immune to challenges.
