The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has officially opened its collation centre for the presidential election.
Earlier on Sunday, the INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, addressed stakeholders.
At the first briefing, he spoke about the conduct of the elections, and the challenges encountered on Saturday, including electoral violence.
Before declaring the collation centre officially opened in his new address, Professor Mahmood enlightened the press and party agents, dishing out instructions as regards processes for when collation proper gets underway.
Now that the collation centre has been formally opened, it is expected that the final collation of results and proceedings leading to the announcement of the winner for the presidential elections will commence.
The INEC Chairman has adjourned the stake-holders session announcing that the centre becomes fully operational from 11 am on Monday, February 25.
