KOWA party, a member of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), has distanced itself from a news alleging that it has endorsed President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term.
Reiterating that Buhari’s government is a “complete failure”, the party’s NEC, in a statement issued by the party’s national secretary, comrade Mark Adebayo, said KOWA remained a member of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) and is actively participating in all activities of the union leading up to the emergence of Ex-VP Atiku Abubakar as coalition candidate.

“We urge all KOWA Party members and supporters across the country and Diaspora to completely disregard such sociopolitical sacrilege against the noble spirit and cause that KOWA Party represents. KOWA Party will never support the complete failure that the Buhari government represents.

“KOWA Party is standing on solid abutments of honor and ideological integrity that can’t just be rubbished so brazenly and shamelessly. We therefore strongly and unequivocally dissociate the Party from the endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari”.

Asked if he had confirmed from the national chairman if he was involved in the endorsement, he retorted “I don’t have to confirm anything from him. He knows he doesn’t have such constitutional authority or power nor mandate to commit the party in that manner without prior and official consultations and official approval by the National Executive Committee of the party at least. And, I know him well enough to affirm that he won’t violate the party’s constitutional in such a flagrant way. Saidu Bobboi, to the best of my knowledge, won’t do such a thing. We are close and have been political allies for years. I consider it fake news”, he insisted.
