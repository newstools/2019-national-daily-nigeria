Head of the Commonwealth Observer Group, Dr Jakaya Kikwete has called for the prosecution of anyone responsible for election-related violence in Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections.
In the group’s Interim Statement presented in Abuja, Kikwete, who is a former President of Tanzania, said that those responsible should be held accountable.
