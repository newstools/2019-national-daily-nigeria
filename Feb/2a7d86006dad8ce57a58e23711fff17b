The Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, in Abuja called on Nigerians to be vigilant within the next 48 hours the votes of the Saturday elections will be collated and announced.
Atiku in a statement by Phrank Shuaibu, his spokesperson,  appealed to Nigerians to maintain utmost vigilance   in the next 48  hours to prevent the majority votes recorded at the polling units being altered by the APC at the collation centres.
Atiku declared in part: “I will like to sincerely thank the millions of people who despite having to bear the additional burden of a postponed election, came out yesterday  to vote for me and  the other PDP candidates standing in the election.
“With  strong shares of votes in the SS, SE as well as an increased share in the  SW VB and NC, we are very pleased with the progress the PDP has made. We look forward to sharing same exciting news in other parts of the country very soon which will confound all the armchair pundits.
Atiku maintained: “the people of  Nigeria can take solace that very soon the living  nightmare  of the last four years will come to an end so that together we will  get Nigeria  working again .”
