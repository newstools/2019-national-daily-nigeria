First Naby Keita. And now Sadio Mane.
The forward has also instructed Timo Werner to join the Reds.
Speaking to Bild, the forward said: “I’d advise him to join Liverpool. I like his style of play. Very forceful, good finish, always giving it 100 percent. If he wants to join us, we’d welcome him to our team.
“When it was clear that Naby would join us, I often watched Leipzig matches. But to be honest: It was dreadful for me at the start.
“Naby saw quite a few red cards. I then asked Kevin Kampl, my friend from our time at RB Salzburg, why Naby always got sent off. He didn’t know.
“Naby missed some important games and I could watch other players more closely. And Timo stood out.”
