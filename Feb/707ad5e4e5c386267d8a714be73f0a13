The father of Ibisaki Amachree, the Independent National Electoral Commission ad-hoc staff who was hit by a bullet fired by a jittery soldier during last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections in Rivers state, Sir Daperi Amachree, has cried out over the dastardly act.`

In a statement, Sir Amachree condemned the unnecessary killing of his daughter, who he described as responsible and peaceful lady whose only crime was to take up a national assignment.

“Here lies my beautiful daughter Ibisaki, a post graduate degree holder, full of cheer, love and kindness and mother of two. She was shot dead yesterday by a trigger happy and jittery soldier while she was on a national assignment with INEC,” he wrote.

“I have never arranged for the death of any youth. I hate violence and thuggery. If law enforcement agents have to kill an enemy, should it be my responsible and peaceful daughter? It is well. Only God knows why it happened. He will surely repay the wicked.”

Recall that the death of Amachree was announced at the weekend by the Chairman of INEC, Mahmood Yakubu, who said she was hit by a “stray bullet.

“We have recorded the first fatality, an adhoc staff was hit by bullet,” Yakubu said.
“We condemn this attack and will forward a comprehensive report for security agencies to investigate,” he added.
