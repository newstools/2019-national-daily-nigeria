One person has been confirmed killed on Saturday as thugs suspected to be members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) stormed Okota, Isolo area of Lagos state chasing away voters who had gathered to exercise their civic rights.

In a number of videos which have gone viral, voters were seen running for their dear lives as sporadic gunshots rang out.

The unidentified hoodlums, whom some claim were also members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) were said to have stormed some polling units in the area, allegedly claiming that non Yorubas will not win elections there.

After they left, some voters returned, only to find that many of the ballot papers had been set on fire

According to one observer, from Ogunbela Avenue, Okota, the thugs disrupted proceedings insisting that “Yorubas own Lagos and everyone must vote APC here. They asked people to go home because they know that this place is Igbo dominated. The two policemen here are not doing anything. They’re stopping anybody from video recording. Will try to get images once situation calms down”.

Meanwhile police in Lagos state said it has arrested 18 suspected thugs across the state.
