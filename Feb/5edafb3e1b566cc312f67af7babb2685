Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, says President Muhammadu Buhari will likely dissolve his cabinet before May 29.
Recall that it took President Buhari six months to unveil his cabinet in 2015 and this attracted widespread criticisms.

Adesina disclosed this while speaking on Arise Television on Thursday, saying the president will not spend a long time before choosing his cabinet members.
He said the president had already promised to do so as soon as possible.

When asked if the president would reshuffle his cabinet, Adesina said: “One thing about governance is that the first mandate was for four years.

“That mandate lapses on May 29, and shortly before May 29, the president is likely going to officially dissolve his government. That is the way it is usually done.

“He says thank you to everybody that he has called to work with him and then he dissolves that government officially.

“Then when he is inaugurated for a second time, he now reconstitute a government; he appoints his personal aides, he forms his cabinet, he appoints other people to fill other positions.”

The president, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), won a second term bid after polling over 15 million votes to defeat Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who secured over 12 million votes in the election.
