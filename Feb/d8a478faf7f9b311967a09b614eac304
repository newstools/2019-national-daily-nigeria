Police in Ogun State have arrested a 39-year old woman, Iwuagwu Onyinyechi, for allegedly defrauding a Christian faith-based organisation to the sum of N100m, under the pretence of assisting the organisation to raise fund for its charity programme.

The police command spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said Onyinyechi’s arrest followed a petition written by a Lagos-based lawyer of the organisation, Godswill Ojakovo, in which he complained that his client was defrauded by the suspect through an act of forgery.

According to Oyeyemi, the suspect claimed to have got a Local Purchase Order (LPO) from a property company and appealed to the organisation to help fund the LPO, consequent upon which a sum of N33.118m was transferred into her bank account.

While the organisation was awaiting the repayment of the loan, the suspect came with another two LPOs she claimed to have got from a Catholic Hospital, Iju and a private school in Ikorodu, Lagos State, upon which another sum of N77m was given to her, after convincing the organisation with relevant documents and proofs to back her claims.

But as soon as the suspect got the last payment in September 2018, she disappeared into thin air and this prompted the organisation to make discreet inquiries about the LPOs she submitted and found out that both of them were forged.

The police got her arrested on January 21, 2019. On interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime.
