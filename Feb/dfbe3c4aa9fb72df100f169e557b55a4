Karim Benzema, author of the first goal of Madrid after a great play by Vinicius, went through the mixed zone after finishing the game. Benzema acknowledged that in the 72nd minute he left the match played (he replaced Asensio), was satisfied with the result, not with the Madrid game, and praised Vinicius.
He left touched: “From the minute 5 it hurt and now my hip hurts, I suffered a blow at the beginning of the game and with the cold it gets hard”.
Will it be for the weekend? “Well, I’m going to rest a day or two and that’s it.”
Ajax pressure: “We did not play very well in the game. They are young, they put a lot of pressure and aggressiveness. It is seen from the beginning. We do not enter well but with a bit of luck we do not fit goals at the beginning. The second half was more or less for the two teams. ”
Great result: “Very good result, but in the field it was not a great game, the result is very important and now we know they play very well, we know more about Ajax for the return but the result is very good and very important ”
Vinicius: “I like to play with him, not because he is young, there is no age to play, he listens a lot, he works a lot and he sees himself in the game, I hope he continues like that because he is a very good player”.
