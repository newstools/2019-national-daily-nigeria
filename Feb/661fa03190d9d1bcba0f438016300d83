Nnamdi Kanu, the fugitive leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra has made another claim about the PDP  presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar.
According to him, Atiku is a Cameroonian.
Kanu now claimed in a broadcast to his followers that Jada, where Atiku was born 72 years ago, was once a part of Cameroon.
Up till  till 59 years ago, Jada was actually a part Cameroon.
Kanu was referring to the situation in British Cameroon before Nigeria’s independence in 1960. Ganye, which incorporates Atiku’s birthplace of Jada was the headquarters of British Cameroon, but following a plebiscite, it chose to stay with Nigeria, to be part of the Sardauna Province, while the other part, joined Cameroon.
Kanu had earlier claimed President Miunammdu Buhari was dead and cloned.
President Buhari had to personally debunk the falsehood, on a foreign trip.
In Kanu’s latest reveal, there is also a stay-at-home order on 16 February for a so-called Biafran referendum.
Atiku’s sympathisers have descended on Kanu since the broadcast as Atiku is counting on votes from the five states in eastern Nigeria to win the presidency on 16 February.
