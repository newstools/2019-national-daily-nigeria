Information Minister and leader of Kwara APC has hinted  the party has put everything in place to ensure that the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday is a huge success.
“ We have watched the rallies in many parts of the country and we want to assure Mr. President that our rally in terms of numbers, quality of people, entertainment and colour will rank among the best,” the Minister said.
He said the crowd that will come out to receive the President will be organic as the party does not engage in renting crowds.
Mohammed, who is also the information and culture minister spoke at a news conference in Ilorin.
He also described the protest in some circles over the redeployment of Police Commissioners across the country as the handiwork of the opposition, which is working to discredit the police and the Independent National Electoral Commission.
Mohammed appealed to security agencies to create a level playing field for all the contestants in the election to allow the people to freely exercise their franchise, saying those involved in legitimate activities have nothing to fear.
