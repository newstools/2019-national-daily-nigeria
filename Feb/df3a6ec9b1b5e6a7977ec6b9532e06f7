New report from the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC), has disclosed that the nation lost about 42,160.87 mega watts (MW) of electricity out of the 88,566.43MW generated by power generation companies (Gencos) in 2018 due to evacuation crisis between Gencos and Discos.

The report however, indicated that the wastages came in from being stucked and unable to get to the end users within the period.
The group revealed that “Only about 46,405.56MW was used across the country due to weak distribution capacity and transmission infrastructure, including the national grid”.

The APGC revelation is further authenticated by the recent disturbing report of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), which averred that “The country’s national grid never transmitted power above 5,375MW, as the average power generated, transmitted and distributed by the grid, which collapses habitually stands at about 3,700MW”.

Defending the appalling statistics, Executive Secretary of APGC, Dr. Joy Ogaji, was quick to state that “The prevailing situation has worsened financial liquidity in the sector, as government has been unable to address losses from the stranded power”.

According to her, “The statistics further showed that in January, of the GenCos’ output of 7,689.04MW, only 3,733.01MW was used, while an average of 3,956.03MW was stranded. In February, available generation stood at 7,584.46MW, while 4,001.33MW was used and 3,583.13MW stranded”.
