The Coalition of United Political Parties on Tuesday alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari is planning to sabotage and again shift the Saturday’s rescheduled presidential and National Assembly elections.
It claimed that the President has directed the Department of State Services to invite and detain the Independent National Electoral Commission’s National Commissioner in charge of Operations, Prof Okechukwu Ibeanu.
The coalition’s national spokesman, Imo Ugochinyere, made the allegation in a statement made available to journalists.
Ugochinyere claimed that Ibeanu’s sin is his refusal to help the ruling All Progresives Congress sabotage distribution and compromise of sensitive election materials.
“The refusal of INEC to proceed with staggered election during the aborted February 16 election which ruined Buhari APC rigging plan is the reason for the new offensive against INEC to intimidate them into submission,” he said.
He further claimed that the idea of detaining the INEC official was instigated by a former Director-General of DSS who he said still runs the agency by proxy.
He added, “The former DG convinced Buhari to allow the use of the DSS to clampdown on INEC to force them to do their bidding or sabotage the rescheduled election and stop it from holding.
“We call on all Nigerians to rise up against this ongoing leadership abuse and madness which have the potentiality to throw Nigeria into electoral violence that will enable Buhari to execute his lawless order that security agencies should publicly start killing people under the guise of ballot box snatching.”
