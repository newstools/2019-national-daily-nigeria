Three Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) have resigned from the party to join an independent group, set up by former Labour MPs.
Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen wrote a joint letter to Theresa May to confirm their departure.
The PM said she was “saddened”, by the letter, the former Tory MPs said the party was “in the grip” of the dup and the pro-leave European research group over Brexit, and said there had been a “dismal failure” to stand up to them.
They wrote: “we find it unconscionable that a party, once trusted on the economy, more than any other, is now recklessly marching the country to the cliff edge of no deal.”
The three MPs said they will support the government on areas such as the economy, security and improvements to public services, but they felt “honour bound to put our constituents’ and country’s interests first” over Brexit.
They told May that they voted for her as a leader because they believed she was committed to a moderate, open-hearted conservative party.
The three said Brexit had “redefined the conservative party – undoing all the efforts to modernize it” and there had been a “shift to the right”.
The pro-remain trio will join the new independent group – made up of eight Labour MPs who resigned from their party over its handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism.
