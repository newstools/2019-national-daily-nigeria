Mbappe rejecting Real Madrid transfer in 2017Real Madrid were keen on signing Kylian Mbappe back in 2017 – but Cristiano Ronaldo inadvertently prevented the transfer from happening.
At the time the young Frenchman was plying his trade with Monaco and attracting attention from every major club in Europe.
Eventually the 20-year-old joined Paris Saint-Germain, where he is a regular for the French champions, who are looking to win the Champions League this season.
On Tuesday night Mbappe was on target for PSG as they beat Manchester United 2-0 at Old Trafford in the first leg of their last-16 clash.
He is once again a Real Madrid target, although would set the Spanish giants back a huge transfer fee.
Los Blancos haven’t replaced Ronaldo since his summer move to Juventus, and they haven’t looked themselves since the Portuguese departed.
Mbappe would certainly fill the void left behind by Ronaldo, but it is precisely this pressure that turned the Frenchman off Madrid in the first place, according to the Daily Record.
The paper claims that Real Madrid president Florentino Perez was in talks to sign Mbappe prior to him joining Paris Saint-Germain.
The Frenchman was allegedly keen on the deal but backed out of it after a chat with his father who agreed it was too big a step at the time.
Ronaldo was hinting his time at Real Madrid was coming to an end and Perez was looking at a long-term replacement for the Portuguese.
Mbappe was tipped to be this man but felt the expectation to take over from the best player on the planet, at just 18 years old, was too much.
