Lady Gaga and her fiance, talent agent Christian Carino, have split up. A representative for the singer-actress confirmed the news to the AP on Tuesday.

No more details were provided, but a source tells People, “Their friends knew they weren’t going to work out in the long run. It always seemed Christian was more into the relationship than Gaga was.” Gaga, 32, and Carino, 49, began dating in 2017.

Gaga was previously engaged to actor Taylor Kinney. Gaga has a big week ahead: She is a double nominee at Sunday’s Academy Awards for her work in A Star Is Born.

Her nominations include best actress and best original song for “Shallow,” which won two Grammys and a Golden Globe. (Gaga recently spoke out on her R. Kelly duet.)
